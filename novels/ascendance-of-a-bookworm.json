    "content": " \n\n\n\n My name is Urano Motosu, and I am twenty-two years old. I love books. I really love books. I love books more than I love getting enough food.\n\n\n I love how the printed words let me reach out and touch another person’s ideas, their fantasies. My heart dances along the roads of thought laid down by the author, and I can’t help but smile. Absorbing the vast knowledge contained within just a single volume always leaves me feeling like I’ve grown as a person. The whole wide world, which I have never seen with my own eyes, is at my fingertips, stacked neatly within the shelves of bookstores and libraries; isn’t it intoxicating? The fairy tales of foreign lands, the glimpses of life in distant times and places, the reaches of every branch of history… when I absorb myself in a book, time evaporates around me.\n\n\n Psychology, religion, history, geography, education, folklore, mathematics, physics, geology, chemistry, biology, art, fitness, language, fiction… All of humanity’s accumulated knowledge and insight has been tightly packed into these books, and I love each of them from the bottom of my heart.\n\n\n Encyclopedias, stretching to fill the entire shelf; the collection of literature, with every volume in place; specialty magazines that look so simple on the cover, but hold such advanced contents; colorful periodicals full of photographs; countless novels, written with fastidious prose; light novels, lacking any depth but still selling fantastically; huge picture books, intended for children; manga, the comics that are the pride of Japan; comics and magazines published by and for fans… the rustling of each turning page is more intoxicating than the finest wine.\n\n\n I also love the smell of the darkest corners of the library archives, where the dusty, even a little musty scent of ancient books fills the air. Just slowly breathing in the smell of old books sends waves of ecstasy crashing through my body. The smell of new books is equally irresistible! The smell of fresh ink on new paper tells me that there is something new waiting to be discovered between those pages, and just thinking about it fills me with excitement.\n\n\n I want to live my entire life surrounded by books. If I can, I want to spend the rest of my life in a dark, but well-ventilated archive, where the books are shielded from the sun’s damaging rays. I’d spend every second I could reading, inseparable from my books, until my skin became ghostly pale, my body weakened from lack of exercise, and I forgot so many meals that I had to be pulled away by force. I want to die buried in books. I don’t want to quietly pass on in bed! Being smothered to death by a mountain of books would make me so unbelievably happy.\n\n\n …Well, I should use the past tense here.\n\n\n Because, just a little while ago…! There was a big earthquake, and I was crushed to death underneath a pile of books! Maaan, really, out of all my wishes to grant, why this?\n\n\n I really did want this, but I’m not really feeling like God did me any favors here. I had just gotten my librarian certificate, and had somehow managed, in this age of unemployment, to find a position at a university library!\n\n\n God, please. If I can, I’d like to be reborn. There’s still so much more for me to read. Even in my next life, I want to read.\n\n\n So, make me a librarian. Let me spend each day surrounded by books. Of course, I know that working as a librarian won’t let me read all the time. It’s a job, and I’ll be busy, and I know that. But still, other jobs won’t let me spend the entire day surrounded by books. Just being surrounded by books will make my happy. The intoxicating smell of ink and paper… who else could appreciate these feelings? Who else can feel this fluttering of my heart that occurs whenever I find myself looking back at all of this amassed history, these words written to preserve the insights of man, a uniquely human labor of the mind that is as old as writing itself?\n\n\n If I can just read, that would be fine. Please, God. If you’ve heard my wish, please let me be reborn. When I am, I can read again."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Bang! Bang! A sound like someone striking the floor or a table rattles me awake, as wherever I was sleeping starts to wobble back and forth. With every oscillation, a shot of pain blasts through my skull like I was being punched in the head, and I let out a small moan.\n\n\n Shut up… please… shut up…\n\n\n The irritating noises and vibrations didn’t stop, continuing at a steady rhythm, not letting me sleep at all.\n\n\n I’m kept awake, painfully aware of the vibrations reverberating within my spinning head. I plug my ears, hoping it will go away. Moving around feels strange, like my body isn’t doing exactly what I tell it to. All of my joints are sore, and I feel feverish all throughout my body, like I’d come down with the flu.\n\n\n “Ugh…”\n\n\n I need my glasses if I want to figure out what’s going on. With my eyes screwed shut, I feel around for the glasses I always keep near my pillow. My entire body feels a little bit numb, and my arm’s movements are sluggish. As I squirm, something beneath me rustles with a sound like grass or paper.\n\n\n “…what’s making that sound?”\n\n\n The voice that comes out of my mouth sounds too high, almost childlike. It might because I’m ill, but it’s not at all the voice I’m used to hearing. Even though I want to do nothing more than sleep off this fever, I can’t just ignore this many abnormalities around me. I slowly open my eyes. My field of vision is warped, thanks to this extremely high fever. I don’t know if it’s the tears in my eyes helping me see in place of my glasses, but everything is much clearer than it usually is.\n\n\n “Eh?”\n\n\n The first thing I notice is a ceiling that, while it may have originally been white, has been stained black with soot. Some number of thick, black beams hold it up, across which a spider has build an enormous web. This is absolutely nothing like any room I remember.\n\n\n “…Where am I?”\n\n\n I look around the room, keeping my head perfectly still so as not to shake the tears from my eyes. It’s obvious, from what I see, that much of what’s around me is entirely unlike the Japan in which I was born and raised. Just from the architectural style of the ceiling, this isn’t a Japanese-style building, it’s Western. Furthermore, it’s not a modern, steel-framed construction, but something much older. The bed I’m on is hard, and there’s no mattress beneath me. Instead, I seem to be lying on some kind of cushion made of a prickly material. Through the dirty cloth that covers it, I smell a strange scent. On top of that, my body itches here and there, like I’m being bitten by ticks or fleas.\n\n\n “W… wait a second…”\n\n\n My most recent memory is being crushed under the weight of countless books, and I don’t remember getting rescued at all. At the very least, I don’t think any hospital in Japan would put a patient on top of a sheet this dirty. Timidly, I try to raise my hand over my head so that I can see it, and what I see is the small, slender hand of a child. I live a lifestyle where I was shut indoors with my books all day, so the untanned and almost unhealthy skin was no surprise, but at twenty-two years of age my hands were, of course, those of an adult. Completely different from these small, malnourished-looking hands before me now. These small, child-like hands that I can open and close at will. As I move around, my body does not feel at all like I’m used to it feeling. At this shocking realization, my mouth goes dry.\n\n\n “…What’s going on?”\n\n\n It’s possible that I might have reincarnated. God might have heard my dying wish and given me new life, so that I may read again. This is incomprehensible. I want to know more about the world around me, so I lift my heavy head and slowly push my feverish body upright. My sweat-soaked hair sticks to the side of my head, but I pay it no mind as I look around the room. I see more bed-like platforms like the one I’m on, the dirty cloths on top of them, and a few boxes full of various things… but no bookshelves.\n\n\n “There’s no… books…”\n\n\n The only door in this room swings open. In an instant, the pounding noise reverberating through my head goes away, only to be replaced by the sound of footsteps as somebody outside bustles about. I really have no idea what’s happening. Based on the beams across the ceiling, the state of the walls, and the kinds of furniture in this room, I feel like this is something out of European history. There’s nothing around me to indicate modern civilization. Is this an extremely backwards country, or have I somehow slipped through time and wound up in the past? If only I knew; if I did, I’d have a lot easier time figuring out my next move.\n\n\n “…Am I hallucinating in my final moments?”\n\n\n As worried tumble around my feverish head, a woman appears in the doorway, having heard me moving around and talking to myself. She is wearing a triangle bandana tied around her head and is in her late 20s, judging by the condition of her once-beautiful face. Her general facial features are pretty enough, but all of the dirt ruins it. If she were to wash her face (and her clothes), she’d look half-decent, but it’s such a shame that she is the way she is now. Generally, I don’t worry too much about someone’s appearance (or my own, really) as long as they keep themselves clean; if they’re filthy, though, I really wish that they’d put a little effort in, otherwise their beauty just goes to waste.\n\n\n “Maine, %&$#[email protected]*+#%?” says the woman in a language I don’t understand.\n\n\n At the sound of her voice, someone else’s memories burst through my consciousness, and I let out a small cry. In the blink of an eye, several years’ worth of memories crowd into my mind. The sheer pressure of it feels like it’s churning my brain to a pulp, and I grab my head in pain.\n\n\n “Maine, are you all right? You didn’t wake up for the longest time! I was starting to get worried.”\n\n\n “…Mom?”\n\n\n A few memories bubble to the surface. The woman who came to check on me and is now gently stroking my head is my mother, and my name is Maine. I don’t know how I suddenly started to understand what she was saying; this deluge of information has left my mind in shambles. Honestly, I wish this could have waited until I was feeling a little better. Sure, I wished that I could be reincarnate so that I could keep reading, and sure, it looks like I have, in fact, been reincarnated, but it’s not like I’m just going to meekly accept that this woman in front of me is suddenly my mother.\n\n\n “How are you feeling? It looks like you have a headache,” she says.\n\n\n The fingers of the hand she places on my forehead are stained with green and yellow spots. Does her job involve working with dye? I remember that workers back in Japan that worked with indigo dye had similar stains on their hands. I don’t want to let this so-called mother, who I simultaneously know nothing about yet somehow remember, touch me, so I flinch away from her outstretched hand, bury myself in the stinking bed, and screw my eyes shut.\n\n\n “…My head… still hurts. I wanna sleep,” I say.\n\n\n “Oh, rest well.”\n\n\n As my mother left this bed-filled room, I started to think deeply. Between the dizziness from my fever and the disarray in my head, there’s no way I could just quietly get back to sleep.\n\n\n “I’m not mistaken… I died, didn’t I?”\n\n\n Unbidden, an image of my own mother floats to the surface of my mind, and I silently apologize that I’ll never see her again. She’ll probably be furious, screaming “how many times did I tell you that you had too many books?!” while choking back tears of grief. I raise a sluggish arm and wipe a tear from my eye.\n\n\n “I’m sorry, Mom…” I whisper, an apology that will never reach her ears.\n\n\n I reluctantly let go of that image, and start to carefully sort through the memories of this child, Maine, that had been dumped into my head. Her latest memory was of having an extremely painful, painful fever, so painful that she couldn’t bear it. It seems to me like, somehow, the Maine who used to own this body died, and I possessed it in her place. Oh, or maybe I was actually reborn in this world, and the delirium of the fever is causing the memories of my past life to resurface?\n\n\n “It doesn’t matter, either way. I’m going to have to live as Maine from now on, there’s no way I can change it…”\n\n\n Since that’s the case, I need to sift through Maine’s memories to learn more about the situation I’m in; otherwise, my family might start to get suspicious. However, no matter how hard I think, Maine’s memories are those of a little girl with still-developing language skills, and there’s a lot that her parents said that she didn’t really understand. She didn’t know what they meant! She’s missing a lot of useful words from her vocabulary, so most of what she remembers is cryptic and ambiguous.\n\n\n “Whoa, no… what should I do?”\n\n\n From Maine’s childish little memories, I’ve figured out what I do know. Her family consists of four people. Her mother is the woman who was just in here. She has an older sister, Tory. Her father has a job that’s something like a soldier.\n\n\n And, most importantly, this is not Earth. From the image in Maine’s head, underneath the bandana that her mother was wearing, her hair is a rich green, like jade. You might think that she’d have to dye it to get it that color, but it really is naturally green. It’s such an unnatural color that I almost kind of want to check to see if it’s a wig. It seems really unlikely, though, that she would be some kind of cosplayer who always wears a green wig and dirty clothes; it’s much more realistic to think that I’m in some sort of alternate dimension.\n\n\n Incidentally, Maine’s sister’s hair is blue-green, and her father’s hair is blue. Maine’s own hair is a deep navy blue. Should I be grateful that my hair is close to black, or should I be sighing at my cosplaying family? Regardless, this house doesn’t seem to have a mirror, and no matter how much I dig I can’t find a clear image of what I look like, apart from my hair color. Well, based on what I know about my mother and father’s looks, and what my sister looks like, I guess I don’t look half bad. I’m also, without a doubt, filthy.\n\n\n “Ughh, I really need a bath. …Do we even have one?”\n\n\n Realistically, my appearance isn’t my biggest concern right now, it’s my living conditions. It seems like the family that I’ve been reborn into is mind-blowingly poor. Just from looking around, things seem pretty bad. The cloth that I, a sick child, am wrapped in is extremely threadbare and worn-out. Even for hand-me-downs from my sister, this is too cruel. I briefly thought that this might be some kind of abuse, but according to Maine’s memories even her mother’s clothes are sewn together out of rags, and her sister’s are much the same. This is the standard for my new family. My father’s work clothes are relatively solid, with only a few patches, but even so he was only ever provisioned one uniform, and that was several years ago.\n\n\n On top of that, this house doesn’t seem to be stand-alone. The wall closest to me is made of some kind of brick, and through it I can hear footsteps climbing up and down stairs and the voices of people who I presume are our neighbors. Perhaps this is some kind of housing complex or apartment building?\n\n\n So, about this reincarnation business… aren’t I supposed to be reborn as some kind of nobility, so that I don’t have to worry about living a difficult life?\n\n\n I breathe a heavy sigh at the rest of my conditions. I may have had a perfectly ordinary lifestyle back in Japan, but that was massively different to what I’m facing now. I don’t know what era or what country I’ve been born into now, but Japan was a nice place to live, overflowing with wonderful things. Comfortable fabrics, soft beds, books, books, more books…\n\n\n “Aaah, I want to read a book. Reading always helps my fevers go down.”\n\n\n No matter how dire my circumstances, I’ll be able to endure it as long as I have books. I place a finger to my temple and concentrate, searching through my memory for books. Where in this house could the bookshelves be?\n\n\n “Maine, you awake?” A voice suddenly breaks through my concentration. A girl, about seven or eight years old, is walking towards me with light footsteps. According to my memories, this is Tory. Her blue-green hair is carefully woven in a simple braid, but I can tell at a glance that it’s extremely dried out and in bad need of washing. Just like her mom, she’s a little dirty all over, and I really want her to wash up. She’s wasting her adorable face.\n\n\n I may be thinking that, but it’s the opinion of an outsider from Japan, a country with a high standard of personal hygiene. Even if you’re poor, you still want to maintain a healthy living environment; otherwise, you’ll fall ill, then you have to see a doctor, then you’ve spent money you don’t have.\n\n\n I really don’t care that much about that right now, though. There’s exactly one thing that’s on my mind.\n\n\n “Tory,” I ask, “could you bring me a ’book’?”\n\n\n Based on Tory’s age, there must be about ten or so picture books in the house. I may need to be resting to get over this sickness, but I can still read. Reading books from an alternate dimension is, right now, my highest priority above all else.\n\n\n “Tory, please!”\n\n\n Tory looks blankly at me, her adorable little sister, with her head tilted to one side. “Huh? What’s a ’book’?”\n\n\n “Wh… uhh, it’s a thing where ’words’ and ’pictures’ have been ’written down’…”\n\n\n “Maine, what are you talking about? I didn’t understand, what did you say?”\n\n\n “I told you, a ’book’! I want a ’picture book’!”\n\n\n “What’s that? I don’t really understand…?”\n\n\n It seems like I might have accidentally used Japanese words in place of words that Maine doesn’t know. No matter how hard I try to explain it to Tory, she just stands there with her head cocked to one side and a dumbfounded expression on her face. Even if I were to just say “get me a book” in Japanese, there’s no way she would understand. I have to dig up this vocabulary, and fast.\n\n\n “Ugh, fine! ’Translation function, engaaaaage!’” I yell.\n\n\n “Maine! What are you getting so mad about?!”\n\n\n “I’m not mad! I just have a headache.”\n\n\n Getting mad at Tory for not understanding me would be an extremely childish thing to do. …I did, though.\n\n\n First off, I need to start focusing everything I’ve got to listening carefully to what people around me are saying and, little by little, start to memorize all of the words I hear. Between Maine’s young, flexible brain and my own 22 year old college graduate’s intuition, memorizing vocabulary should be easy… in theory. At the very least, if I think back on what I went through when I was learning other languages so that I could read foreign books, it wasn’t unmanageably difficult. The zeal and love with which I dedicated myself to my books was enough to drive other people away.\n\n\n “…Are you angry because you still have a fever?” asks Tory. She reaches her hand towards my forehead, probably to feel my temperature. Without thinking, I grab her filthy hand before she can touch me.\n\n\n “I’m still sick, won’t you get sick too?” I ask. Although I’m pretending to show concern for my sister, I’m really just trying to stop her from doing something disgusting. I really don’t want Tory to touch me with those filthy hands, so I’m employing this adult technique to avoid it.\n\n\n “Oh, I guess so. Take care!”\n\n\n Safe. If she were clean, she’d be a great older sister, but right now I don’t want to be touched at all. If this is the situation I’m in, then I’m going to have to pound the concept of hygiene into their skulls. If I don’t start improving things around here, I don’t think I’ll be able to survive. According to these memories, Maine has always been a weak child, and was bedridden and feverish far too often. I have too many memories of this bed.\n\n\n If I’m going to be able to read to my heart’s content, I need to first make sure that I’m healthy and that my environment is sanitary. This family is way too poor, so if I get sick nobody will be able to call a doctor. Even if they did, from the looks of this place I can’t imagine they’d be any good, so I definitely don’t want to have to be in their care.\n\n\n Mother calls from another room. “Tory, come help me with dinner!” “Yes, mother,” says Tory, and runs away with a pitter-patter.\n\n\n Judging from the angle of the sunlight that streams through the window, it probably is time to start dinner preparations. Tory looks like she should still be in elementary school, but already she’s helping out a lot with the housework. What a state of poverty this is, for children to be relied on for manual labor.\n\n\n “Ugh, this is bad…”\n\n\n The thought of what my life will be like when I grow up is really depressing. No matter how I think about it, I’m going to be stuck doing housework forever. I’m not going to very much time for reading. Housework was already a huge bother when I was still in Japan with all of its convenient appliances; is a useless woman like me who spends all her time reading even able to adapt to life like this?\n\n\n Bang! Bang! An intermittent, lively sound reverberates through the room. Mom said it was time to work on preparing dinner, so that’s probably the sound of cooking, but what in the world is happening out there? I can’t see anything from where I am, but at the same time I really don’t want to know that badly.\n\n\n I have to stay positive! I’m not going to waste this reincarnation. There are books here to read that I could have never read on Earth! My first order of business is to take care of my physical condition. With that decided, I slowly close my eyes.\n\n\n “I’m home!”\n\n\n “Hi, Father!”\n\n\n I hear clanging sounds, like metal plates rubbing against each other. My father has returned home, just in time for dinner. Maine is still too feverishly sick to eat, so I gradually drift off to the sounds of the happy family meal in the other room. As my mind slips into the dark, there’s only one thought on my mind.\n\n\n Ah, I don’t care what it is, I just want to read a book."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n After three days, my fever finally went away, and I’ve slowly recovered enough to be able to keep some food down. What I’ve been eating has been finely chopped vegetables floating in bland soup. It’s okay for now since I’ve been sick, but I don’t think I’ll be able to stand it once I’m healthy again. Also, I’m pretty used to being called Maine by now. I’m going to have to live as Maine for the rest of my life, so I need get used to it quickly.\n\n\n “Maine, you done?” asks Tory as she comes in to check on me.\n\n\n “Yeah.”\n\n\n I hand my empty dishes over to her, and quietly lie back down on my bed.\n\n\n “Get some rest, Maine.”\n\n\n In these last three days, I haven’t even left this room! I’ve only ever gotten up to use the restroom, and after that I’m always brought right back to bed. Isn’t that too harsh? On top of that, I said “restroom”, but it’s really just a chamber pot kept in the bedroom. It’s extremely embarrassing! Also, not only does the rest of the family use this same chamber pot, but when they’re done, they just fling the contents out the window! And, of course, there’s no bath, either! I couldn’t stand it after a while and tried to wipe myself clean, and everyone looked at me as if I’d gone instane. This lifestyle… I can’t take it anymore!!\n\n\n It’s not like I can do anything about it, though. As a very young, sick child, even if I were to run away, there’s no way I’d be able to live the kind of life I’d want. I still have the mind of an adult, so this much is obvious. I’m not going to heedlessly run away, no matter how much I hate this situation. Judging from what I’ve seen in here so far, I don’t think the outside is going to be much better. I have no idea if there’s any child protection services or shelters or anything like that around here, and even if there were I don’t know if they’d be any improvement over this place.\n\n\n If I run away from the filth here, all that’ll happen is that I’ll spend my last few days running around the streets, getting covered in falling waste, and finally dying on the side of the road. What I need to do is focus on getting better so that I can then work on improving the conditions around here.\n\n\n My first goal is to get well enough that I can get out of bed without people being mad at me. ……Well, it’s a start.\n\n\n Then, before anything else: books. The first step towards improving my environment is definitely finding books. If I have a book, then I’ll be able put up with all of these grievances. I’ll persevere! And, so, I have decided that today I’m going to go explore this house. I’ve gone too long without reading a book; I’m starting to feel the edges of withdrawal.\n\n\n Give me a book! Raaagh! I’ll cry! A grown woman will burst into tears in public!\n\n\n Since I’ve got an older sister, I should be able to find around ten picture books somewhere in here. Unless I’m mistaken, I don’t think I actually know how to read this language, but at least I can look at the pictures and try to puzzle out the meanings of each word.\n\n\n The door opens quietly, and Tory sticks her head in. “Maine, you sleeping?” she whispers. I lie quietly in my bed, and she nods in satisfaction. Every time I’ve woken up, I’ve slipped out of bed in search of a book, only to collapse as I wandering around, so Tory has taken it upon herself to keep a close watch on me. When our mother leaves in the morning to go to work, she leaves Tory in charge of my care. Tory has been desperately trying to keep me in bed, and with my tiny body, no matter how much I try to run I can never break free from her grip.\n\n\n “I am absolutely going to ‘dominate’ you,” I mutter.\n\n\n “What was that?” asks Tory.\n\n\n “…Hm? Oh, I just want to get big.”\n\n\n Not really understanding the real meaning behind my answer, Tory gives me a troubled smile. “If you get healthy again, you’ll get bigger! You’re always so sick that you’re not eating, so even though you’re five, people still think that you’re three.”\n\n\n Oh, am I five, then? With an atypically frail build. This is the first I’ve heard of it. I can’t remember any birthday parties, so I couldn’t figure it out for myself. Or, maybe, could there have been parties that I just don’t recognize, since I don’t know the language very well?\n\n\n “Tory,” I ask, “Are you big?”\n\n\n “I’m six, but everyone thinks I’m seven or eight, so maybe I’m a little big?”\n\n\n “Ahh.”\n\n\n We’re only a year apart, but what a difference in physique. Surpassing her might be extremely difficult, but I can’t give up just yet. I’m going to eat right, take care of my hygiene, and get healthy.\n\n\n “Mom’s gone to work,” says Tory, “so I need to wash the dishes. Really, don’t get out of bed! If you don’t sleep, you won’t get better, and if you don’t get better, you won’t grow any bigger!” “Okay!”\n\n\n In preparation for sneaking out, I’ve been playing the good kid ever since last night so that Tory will let down her guard a little bit. I’ve been waiting patiently ever since for her to finally leave me alone and go somewhere else.\n\n\n “Right, I’m going now. Be good and stay here, okay?”\n\n\n “Okaaay!” I answer, the picture of obedience.\n\n\n Tory closes the door with a clack. I wait quietly as she grabs the box full of dirty dishes and heads out the door. I don’t know where she goes to wash the dishes, but she’s always gone for about twenty to thirty minutes. It looks like each home doesn’t have its own water supply, so there’s probably a well or fountain for public use.\n\n\n Heh heh heh… Now, get out!!\n\n\n From what I think is the entranceway, I hear the clunk of a turning lock, followed by the fading sound of Tory’s footsteps on the stairway. I wait until I can’t hear her at all anymore, then quietly get out of my head. I grimace as I feel the grit of the floor bite into my bare feet. Walking around barefoot in a house where everyone wears shoes is profoundly disgusting, but Tory, in an attempt to stop me from walking around, hid my shoes, so I have no choice. Searching for a book is my top priority, I have no time to worry about the defilement of my feet.\n\n\n “If they’re in here after all, I might have spoke too soon…”\n\n\n In this bedroom where my feverish self has been locked away, there are two beds, three wooden boxes full of clothing and other miscellaneous things, and a few baskets with other sundry items. In the basket next to my bed, there’s a few toys made from wood and straw, but no books. If there’s a bookshelf, it would probably be in the living room.\n\n\n “Yyyuck…”\n\n\n With every step I take, the gritty floor grinds into the soles of my feet. It’s customary here to walk around the house with shoes on, so I know that even if I want to complain, it’s not going to do very much good. Even still, the customs of Japan have been so thoroughly ingrained in me that it’s going to be next to impossible to adapt. If I’m going to keep living as Maine, though, there are a lot of things I’m going to have to get used to.\n\n\n “Grr, too high…”\n\n\n I’ve hit the first major obstacle in my home exploration: the bedroom door. It’s not as if I can’t reach the knob at all; if I stand on my tiptoes and reach as high as I can go, my fingertips just barely brush the bottom of it. Turning it, however, is a much bigger problem. I glance around the room, looking for something to use as a stool. My gaze settles on the wooden box my clothes are stored in.\n\n\n “Hnnnngh!”\n\n\n If I were an adult, moving this box would be a piece of cake, but no matter how hard I push and pull, my little hands can’t budge it. I could maybe flip over the basket that holds my toys, but it doesn’t look like it would be able to support my weight.\n\n\n “Man, I’ve got to get bigger soon; there’s too much I can’t do right now.”\n\n\n After looking around the bedroom some more and thinking over my options, I decided to try folding up my parents’ bedding and standing on that. There’s absolutely no way that I’d let my own bedding touch this grimy floor that people walk on with boots, but my parents are used to living in conditions like this so it’s absolutely fine to use theirs. If it’s for the sake of finding a book, making my parents a little upset is no big deal at all.\n\n\n “Hup!”\n\n\n I stand on my tiptoes on top of the folded bedding and grab the doorknob. I twist with the entire weight of my body, and the knob turns. The door swings open with a creak… right towards me.\n\n\n “Wha?!”\n\n\n The door swings right towards my head with great force. I frantically let go of the knob, and stumble backwards.\n\n\n “Who-o-o-o-a!”\n\n\n With a clatter, I tumble off of the piled-up bedding and hit my head.\n\n\n “Ow…”\n\n\n I clutch my head as I rise to my feet. I notice that the door is still slightly ajar! My headache is only just another sacrifice to the cause.\n\n\n “I did it! It’s open!”\n\n\n I leap forward, stick my fingers into the crack, and pull the door the rest of the way open. I see that my parents’ mattress has slid across the floor, and it’s left a clean track behind it… but I’ll pretend not to notice for now.\n\n\n “Aha, the kitchen!”\n\n\n I leave the bedroom and find myself in a kitchen. “Kitchen” in the modern sense of the word might be a little, generous; this really looks more like an old-style cookhouse. In the corner I see a stove, with a cast iron pot sitting on top, and something that looks like a frying pan hung up on the wall next to it. A clothesline runs across the room, from which a grimy-looking cleaning rag hangs. Anyone trying to wipe something off with that rag is surely only going to make it worse.\n\n\n “It’s no wonder I’ve got a weak constitution with sanitation like this…”\n\n\n In the center of the room is a somewhat small table, two three-legged stools, and a box that seems to be being used as another stool. On the right side of the room is a wooden cabinet, probably being used as a cupboard. In the corner opposite the stove sits a large basket, filled with raw vegetables that look almost like potatoes and onions. There’s a sink here as well, with a large jug of water next to it. The sink is probably filled by pouring water from the jug; it looks like there really isn’t running water here.\n\n\n As I finish looking around the room, I notice two more doors besides the one leading back to the bedroom.\n\n\n “Ohoho, which one is the right one?”\n\n\n This kitchen really doesn’t look like the kind of place where I’d find a bookshelf, so I open one of the other doors that head out of the kitchen.\n\n\n “Hm, a storage room?”\n\n\n Beyond the door is a room that’s crammed full of a mess of tools and things that I’ve never seen before. Everything’s on shelves, but things are piled on them so haphazardly that it doesn’t look like anything in here is used very much at all.\n\n\n “Wrong one, huh…”\n\n\n I give up on this room and head over to the second door. I reach up and pull on the knob, but the lock only clunks dully against the frame. I rattle the door again and again, but there’s no sign of it giving way at all.\n\n\n “Don’t tell me, this is the door Tory went through…? Eh? Both were wrong?! Neither were right?!”\n\n\n Suddenly perplexed, I mumble aloud to myself. This is a two-bedroom apartment with a kitchen… but no bath, no toilet, no running water, and no bookshelves. No matter how hard I look, I can’t find another room.\n\n\n Hey, God, do you have a grudge?!\n\n\n In all of the light novels out there about reincarnation, the vast majority of them dropped the protagonist amongst the rich and noble, and very few of the remainder place her in abject poverty. I have the memories and sensibilities of a modern-day citizen of Japan; there is no way I’m going to be able to live in a house with no bath, no toilet, no running water.\n\n\n On top of that, the thing that I was most worried about: I can’t find any books. I looked all through the storage room and couldn’t find anything even remotely resembling a book.\n\n\n “…No way, are books expensive?”\n\n\n On Earth, before the invention of machines that could print books easily, books were ridiculously expensive. If you weren’t a member of the highest echelons of society, your opportunities to read books were few and far between.\n\n\n “I’ve got no choice. If it’s come to this, right now, I need to find words.”\n\n\n Even if I don’t have any books, it’s still possible for me to start learning to read. There could be newspapers, pamphlets, magazines, calendars, even advertisements! There absolutely has to be something around here that has at least one word written on it somewhere.\n\n\n At least, there would be in Japan.\n\n\n “…Nothing! Absolutely nothing! Not a single thing! What kind of house is this?!”\n\n\n I have gone through every item on every shelf of the storage room and the cupboard, and not only have I, of course, still not found any books, but there hasn’t been so much as a single letter printed on anything at all. Printing aside, I can’t even find a single piece of paper!\n\n\n “What the heck is… this…”\n\n\n Blinding pain blasts through my head, as if my fever had come roaring back. My heart pounds in my chest, and I am deafened by the sudden ringing in my ears. I crumple to the floor, as if the strings holding me up were suddenly cut. My eyes are so hot.\n\n\n Dying, crushed by books, had been my dream; being reincarnated, well, that’s okay too. But how am I supposed to live like this? What am I to live for? I hadn’t even thought that I could be reborn into a world without books. Why was I even born?!\n\n\n Tears run down my face as I struggle to find a reason to keep living.\n\n\n “Maine!! What are you doing up?! You shouldn’t have gotten out of bed without your shoes!” shouts Tory, as she walks into the kitchen to find me crumpled on the ground.\n\n\n “…Tory… there’s no 'books’…”\n\n\n Even though I want to read so badly, there’s no books. I have no idea why, or even how, I’m going to keep living on.\n\n\n “What’s wrong? Are you hurt?” asks Tory, concerned, as I lay there with tears constantly streaming from my eyes. There’s no way for me to explain. She can’t even see that not having books is a problem, how could she understand my feelings?\n\n\n I want a book.\n\n\n I want to read.\n\n\n Hey, is there even anyone out there who would understand?\n\n\n Where can I find a book?\n\n\n Please, someone tell me."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Yesterday, I cried, and cried, and cried. When my parents called me for dinner, and even when they got mad at me for getting their bedding so dirty, the only reaction I could muster was more weeping. This morning, my eyes are hot and puffy from crying too much, and my head is pounding. However, my fever has gone away completely, and my body no longer feels sluggish and heavy. All that crying seems to have cleared away my foul mood as well.\n\n\n After breakfast with my family, my mother fussed over my puffy face.\n\n\n “Ah, your fever’s gone.”\n\n\n With hands still cold from washing up, she feels my forehead, then rubs at the corners of my eyes. The coolness of her touch feels amazing.\n\n\n “Say, Maine,” says my mother, “now that you’re well, would you like to help with the shopping today?”\n\n\n “Huh? Mommy, what about work? My fever’s gone now, so is it okay for you to not go to work?”\n\n\n Didn’t she say something earlier, like… “Work at the dyer’s shop is unbelievably busy right now, so even though Maine has a fever, I can’t take any time off”? She’s a working woman! Is this okay?\n\n\n She looks at me, with my head cocked curiously to one side, then looks down sadly.\n\n\n “Tory has been taking care of almost all of your nursing, and I thought it was such a shame that I wasn’t letting her go outside even a little… but yesterday, you were crying and crying, and Tory got so concerned. She said that she thought you might have started crying because you were so lonely, so she went around and begged our neighbors to help me take some time off.”\n\n\n At those words, my breath caught in my throat. I, a woman with the mental maturity of a twenty-two-year-old, spent an entire day crying, without even bothering to think of what anyone around me would think. I’m so ashamed that I want to go dig a hole and bury myself in it. Now that I’ve finally calmed down, what I did seems so unbelievably embarrassing.\n\n\n “I’m… I’m… sorry…” I stammer.\n\n\n “You don’t need to apologize, Maine. Being sick makes everyone feel a little helpless.”\n\n\n My mother gently strokes my head to comfort me. Her gentleness only makes my feelings of guilt crash down on me even harder.\n\n\n I’m so sorry. I was crying out of despair from realizing that there were no books, not at all because I was lonely because you were gone. Going looking for books as soon as Tory left the house… I don’t know what I was thinking. I’m truly, truly sorry.\n\n\n “Tory’s going with everyone to the forest nearby,” says my mother, “but I don’t want you to push yourself when you’ve only just gotten better. How about coming with me and doing some shopping?”\n\n\n “Yeah!” I reply.\n\n\n “Oh! You cheered up quickly.”\n\n\n My mother smiles happily at me, probably thinking that I’m overjoyed to spend some time with her.\n\n\n I grin back at her. “It’s gonna be fun!”\n\n\n My mother looks so happy, so I’m in no hurry to tell her this, but the real reason for my mood swing was the realization that if I went outside, I might be able to get something to read. If I come along to go shopping, I might even be able to get my mother to buy me a book! It doesn’t have to be a really thick one. For now, all I want is something that will help me learn the writing system. A workbook or something like that, aimed at kids, would be perfect. Maybe even just a chart with all of the letters on it!\n\n\n I’m positive that if I smile cutely and say something like, “I won’t get lonely if I have a book! I’ll be a good girl and stay inside and help with the chores,” then my mother will eventually cave to the begging of her adorable, frail little girl and buy me a picture book. Eh heh heh. This is going to be fun indeed.\n\n\n “Mom, I’m heading out,” says Tory, peeking into the bedroom with a huge smile on her face. Since our mother has the day off today, Tory, who would ordinarily be stuck watching me, has the day off as well.\n\n\n “Alright, go meet up with everyone. Take care out there!” says our mother.\n\n\n “Yes, Mom!”\n\n\n Tory slings a big wicker basket over her back like a backpack, then takes off with a spring in her step. She’s acting like she’s going to go play with her friends, but in reality this is yet another chore. She’s gathering firewood! While she’s at it, she’ll also be looking out for nuts, berries, and mushrooms to bring back with her. Whether our next few meals will be tasty or bland depends entirely on Tory.\n\n\n You can do it, Tory! Spice up my life!\n\n\n Children in this world seem to be put to work helping out with the chores very early in this world. It seems like there aren’t any schools in this world, in addition to everything else that’s missing. At the very least, I didn’t see anything that looked like a school at all when I was digging through my memories. Tory’s starting to grow up a little bit, so it looks like she’s starting to work as an apprentice.\n\n\n If I can, I’d like to do my apprenticeship under a librarian, or maybe even at a bookstore. Today will be a perfect day for me to gather some information while we’re out and about. I’ll figure out where the bookstore is, then make friends with the shopkeeper, and eventually become their apprentice. Hey, it’s okay to be impressed by the cunning of this little girl, heh heh.\n\n\n “Now then, Maine, shall we head out as well?”\n\n\n This will be my first time leaving this building since I became Maine! The first time I’ve worn clothing that wasn’t just pajamas, too. These clothes are worn-out hand-me-downs as well, but they’re a little thicker, and I’ve been bundled up in countless layers. I’m so fluffy that it’s hard to move! It would seem that it’s cold outside.\n\n\n I reach up to take my mother’s hand, and follow her, for the first time, outside.\n\n\n Cold!\n\n\n Cramped!!\n\n\n Stinky!!!\n\n\n The buildings are all made of stone, and it feels like their walls are sucking what little heat there is out of the air. Despite all of the clothes that I’m bundled in, the frigid air seeps through immediately, chilling me to the bone.\n\n\n I’d give anything for some Heat-Tech, or some fleece, or even one of those chemical warmer things. While I’m wishing, I want a face mask, too! Something to block this stench and stop me from getting sick again.\n\n\n Immediately outside the house is a stairway. A stairway so steep and narrow that I, stuck with the athletic ability of a three-year-old, am terrified of taking even the first step. My mother pulls on my hand, and we go down, with the warped boards creaking beneath our feet as we turn and turn and turn. After about two stories, though, the wooden stairs are replaced by sturdy, well-maintained stone.\n\n\n This is the same building… why’s there such a difference?\n\n\n My face may be screwed up against the cold and stench, but I’m finally outside. By my estimation, I think our house is on the fifth floor of this seven-story building. Honestly, with my tiny body, weak constitution, and general lack of strength, even just going outside is heavy labor by itself. I guess it’s only natural that most of Maine’s memories are of being indoors.\n\n\n “Haaahh, haaahhhh… Mommy, I can’t… breathe… Slow down!”\n\n\n We’ve only just started, and already I’m completely out of breath. I’m so weak that I have no idea if I’ll even be able to drag myself to our destination without collapsing in the street.\n\n\n “We’ve only just left the house! Are you okay?”\n\n\n “Yeah. I’m okay. Let’s go.”\n\n\n At the very least, I want to figure out where the bookstore is. As I take some time to catch my breath, I take a look around my surroundings. Right outside our apartment building is something like a small plaza, centered on a public water well. The area immediately around the well has been paved with stone, and it’s full of old ladies chatting while they scrub away at their laundry. This must be the place where Tory goes to do the dishes, and where that big water jug gets filled up every morning.\n\n\n “Mommy, did you do the laundry?” I ask.\n\n\n “I did! It’s all done already.”\n\n\n These clothes still look a little dirty, but they’ve apparently been washed. Perhaps the detergent here isn’t very good… I’m going to have to think about making some soap, too.\n\n\n The plaza is surrounded on all sides by other tall apartment buildings, with a single road leading out to the rest of the town. We make our way along that narrow street, turn the corner, and find ourselves in an enormous main avenue.\n\n\n Whoa, the streets of a foreign country…\n\n\n The unfamiliar townscape stretches out before me. Pack animals, vaguely like horses or donkeys, clop along the cobbled roads, passing the merchants’ stalls that fill both sides of the streets.\n\n\n “Mommy,” I ask, “What store are we going to?”\n\n\n “Hmm, Maine, what are you saying? We’re going to the town market, you know? We don’t usually go to the shops.”\n\n\n It seems like the neatly-kept shops set up in the first floor of these buildings are usually frequented by people who actually have money, and lowly commoners like us usually don’t have any need to go there. Instead, the daily shopping seems to be done at the town’s market.\n\n\n …So, does that mean that the bookstore is going to be a shop in one of these buildings, then?\n\n\n As I look around, searching for any sign of a bookstore, I catch sight of an impressively large building, which looks like a local landmark. It’s simply built, but its off-white stone walls radiate majesty and draw the eye to it.\n\n\n “Oh, a castle?” I ask, pointing at the building.\n\n\n “That’s the temple, you know? When you’re seven, you’ll be going there to get baptized.”\n\n\n Ah, a church. A church, hmm. I really dislike the obligations of religion. I’d really rather not get anywhere near there, if I can help it.\n\n\n Thanks to my modern Japanese sensibilities, I want to keep my distance from religion. I’m not sure how acceptable that’s going to be in this world, though, so I bite back my objections. Instead, I turn my attention to the walls I see beyond the temple.\n\n\n “Mommy, what about those walls?”\n\n\n “Those are castle ramparts,” she says. “The lord of the land makes his home in there, as do the rest of the nobility. We don’t really have much business there, though.”\n\n\n “Hmmm…”\n\n\n I can’t see anything besides tall, stone walls, so from here it looks less like a castle and more like a prison. Maybe they’re built like that so that they’re fortified against outside attack? For some reason, when I think of European-style castles, I imagine them to be really luxurious. Ah, although, I guess it does kind of look like a castle that also needed to be a fortress.\n\n\n “So, what’s that wall?”\n\n\n “That’s the outer wall. It protects this district from the outside world. If you keep going straight along this road, you’ll find a gate going outside. Your dad’s probably working there right now.”\n\n\n “…Daddy?”\n\n\n From Maine’s memories, I know that my father is some kind of soldier, but I didn’t know he was a gate guard. More importantly, though, the lord’s castle is built like a fortress and surrounded both by ramparts and the outer walls. Based on that, I wonder if I should be thinking of this place as a city? Judging by the size of the walls surrounding this district and the stampede of people that fills this street, this doesn’t seem to be a fairly large district, but I’m comparing it to, say, Tokyo or Yokohama, and I don’t know how valid that comparison really is.\n\n\n Aaaaargh, the size of a bookstore depends on the size of the city, and I don’t even have a basis for comparison! Is this district big? Is it small?! Please, tell me, O great teacher!\n\n\n “Maine, let’s get going,” says my mother. “If we don’t get to the market soon, all the good things will be gone!”\n\n\n I nod. “Okay.”\n\n\n As we walk, I keep my eyes peeled, constantly on the lookout for any sign of a bookstore. Strangely enough, I notice that the signs advertising the shops that line the streets are all illustrated. There’s wooden signs with images painted on them, and metal signs with graphics engraved or beaten into them, but I have yet to see a single thing that looks like a written word. These signs are all designed so that even someone like me, who can’t read at all, can understand them easily, which has made searching for a bookstore really easy, but… I suddenly have a terrifying thought.\n\n\n Huh? Is there anything written down here at all? Not just in our house, but in this entire district? Maybe the literacy rate is low? …Maybe, writing hasn’t even been invented yet?!\n\n\n The color drains from my face as I realize the ramifications of this idea. I’d never even bothered to think that writing itself might not exist. If the written word hasn’t been discovered, after all, books just don’t exist.\n\n\n “Maine, there’s lots of people out here. Don’t fall behind!” says my mother, chidingly.\n\n\n “…Yeah,” I say in a small voice.\n\n\n I’m barely conscious of the movement of my feet as I struggle to hold back my terror, so we arrive at the market before I know it. The chattering of a crowd unexpectedly assaults my ears, and I lift my head to see a bustling square, packed with carts, stalls, and people milling about. It kind of reminds me of the crowds you’d see at festivals back in Japan, and for a second I feel strangely nostalgic.\n\n\n Suddenly, I spot something at a nearby fruit stand that I had given up all hope of seeing. My eyes go wide and I start grinning uncontrollably, and I tug on my mother’s skirt to get her attention.\n\n\n “Mommy, look! There’s something ‘written’ there!!”\n\n\n Wooden signs have been fixed to each basket of merchandise, and written upon them are some sort of glyphs. I can’t read them, so I don’t know if they’re numbers or letters, but one thing’s for sure: writing does indeed exist here. Just from seeing this one thing, blood rushes to my face, and I’m keenly aware of how hungry I’ve been for writing.\n\n\n “Oh, that’s the price. That’s there so that you know how much you’ll need to pay if you buy it.”\n\n\n “But it’s written!!” I exclaim.\n\n\n My mother must be confused as to why I’ve suddenly become so energetic, but that doesn’t matter right now. As we walk around, I have her read off every single number I can find, and I focus as hard as I can on matching the numbers to the symbols.\n\n\n All right, all right! Come on, my synapses!!\n\n\n “So, is this one thirty lions?” I ask.\n\n\n After a while of having numbers read to me, I cut in and read one out loud on my own, then look up at my mother for her reaction. It looks like I’m right: my mother is looking down at me, blinking in astonishment.\n\n\n “That’s amazing, Maine, you picked that up so quickly!”\n\n\n “Heh heh…”\n\n\n There are ten numerals, so it looks like the counting system is in base 10. I’m really glad it’s not in base 2, or base 60, or anything else like that. Now that I know what symbols are attached to which numbers, performing calculations should be a piece of cake.\n\n\n Ah, could it be, have I tripped the Genius flag? Although, that is the kind of flag that says I’ll be a prodigy at ten, merely talented at fifteen, and then just ordinary after I hit twenty…"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Now then, last on the list is meat. We’re going to get a lot of it, and then we’re going to need to salt it, or maybe smoke it…”\n\n\n My mother, finished with buying our fruits and vegetables, heads towards the center of the market. There, it seems like the meat sellers are lined up against the outer wall.\n\n\n “Why are we buying so much?” I ask.\n\n\n “We have to prepare for winter, you know?” replies my mother. “Around this time of year, the farmers all have to bring their livestock in for the year. Anything that won’t make it through the winter gets butchered, so this time of the year is when the most meat is sold. The animals have also been eating a lot to prepare for winter, so their meat is very fatty and delicious.”\n\n\n “…Umm, in the winter, does the market go away too?”\n\n\n “Of course it does, you know? There aren’t very many vegetables gathered during the winter, so the market isn’t open very often.”\n\n\n Now that I think about it, it’s obvious, but the thought hadn’t occurred to me at all. In Japan, before greenhouse cultivation became commonplace, vegetables were sold seasonally, and before distribution methods were developed, they were all grown locally. You can keep food fresh for long periods of time with freezers or refrigerators, but before those things existed, you needed to actually preserve the food in your house.\n\n\n “…I’ve never actually prepared for winter,” I mumble.\n\n\n “Did you say something?” asks my mother.\n\n\n “Nuh-uh.”\n\n\n Preserving food at home, huh… Where in that tiny apartment are we going to preserve anything? That storage room isn’t nearly big enough, right? Man, I’m glad that I’m a such a little girl; I’m so small that I’d only get in the way if I tried to help, so I’m not going to be scolded when I don’t.\n\n\n “…Erk, it stinks!”\n\n\n “That’s the smell of meat!”\n\n\n The stench grows unbearable as we approach the butchers. I pinch my nose to stop the smell, but my mother keeps walking forward, looking like this was nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n\n Meat’s supposed to smell like this? Ughhh, I’ve got a bad feeling about this…\n\n\n Even though my nose is plugged, the air is so foul that the very taste of it makes my eyes water as I finally arrive at the row of butchers’ shops. On the counters, aside from the bacon and ham I expected, legs of meat are lined up, still attached to the feet and recognizable as animal parts. Inside the shop, dead animals, drained of blood, swing from the rafters. Bunnies and birds line the shelves, their eyes wide open and their tongues lolling out of their mouths.\n\n\n “Gyaaaaaaah!!” I scream.\n\n\n “What’s wrong, Maine?!”\n\n\n To be honest, for someone like me, who’s only ever seen raw meat after it’s already been completely disassembled, cut up into little pieces, and put in packs, the butchers’ shops of this world are a little too over-stimulating. All the hairs on my body stand on end, tears stream down my face, and I screw my eyes shut to block out the awful sight. The single glimpse I caught, though, remains fixated with my mind, and won’t go away no matter how much I want to forget it.\n\n\n “Maine? Maine?!”\n\n\n My mother shakes me side to side. At that instant, a pig screams as its dissection begins, and my eyes snap open. Smiling people have gathered around me, watching and waiting eagerly as an animal is murdered right in front of them.\n\n\n Why do you look like this is fun, people? Why are you smiling so much?! Stop it! Stop it stop it! This is terrifying!!\n\n\n “Urkh……”\n\n\n The pig squeals out one final time as the knife rams home. My own small cry joins it, and I faint on the spot.\n\n\n Something’s being poured into my mouth. It’s a harsh, astringent, extremely stimulating liquid that smells like strong alcohol. Since I’m not quite awake enough to drink it properly, it flows straight down my windpipe. I leap to my feet, my eyes wide open, and start an enormous coughing fit.\n\n\n “Cough! Cough! Cough!”\n\n\n Is this actual alcohol?! What unbelievable idiot would dare force such a powerful spirit down the throat of such a helpless and innocent young child?! What would you do if I’d gotten alcohol poisoning?!\n\n\n My mother is next to me, holding a bottle of alcohol.\n\n\n “Maine, are you awake? Ahh, that’s a relief, I’m so glad that I could wake you up.”\n\n\n “Cough! …Mommy?!”\n\n\n With a huge sigh of relief, my mother hugs me tightly. I might not be very good at putting things into words at the moment, but I can speak my mind now, right?\n\n\n Don’t shove such a strong alcohol down the throat of a small child!! And especially do not do so to a child who not only has a weak constitution, but has also just finally recovered from a fever so high that you thought she would die!! Are you trying to kill me?! Are you an idiot?! Do you want me to die?!\n\n\n “Alright then, Maine. Now that you’re awake, let’s go back and get that meat.”\n\n\n “What?!”\n\n\n A shudder ripples through me. That horrifying spectacle has already been seared into my memory. It flashes before my eyes like a daydream, and just the memory of it gives me goosebumps. I do not want to go back there. This woman, she used strong alcohol to revive a young girl, and now she’s taking the girl who literally just fainted at the sight of the butcher and dragging her back to the butcher… could it be that she’s a brute?\n\n\n “…Ummmm, I still don’t feel good,” I say. “I’m gonna stay here. Mommy, go ahead!”\n\n\n “Eh? But…”\n\n\n I give my hesitant mother a sidelong glance, then spin in place to face the lady running the shop. I need to secure my position before she drags me away.\n\n\n “Excuse me, but could you let me wait here?” I say to the shopkeep. “I’m not going to be any trouble, I’ll just sit right here.”\n\n\n “Oh, you’re very level-headed for such a little girl,” she replies, with a dry, crackling laugh. “Your mother did just buy some liquor, so I’ll let you stay for a bit. It would be awful if I kicked out a little girl who wasn’t feeling well and she had another accident, right? Take care of your shopping, ma'am, I’ll watch her for you.”\n\n\n It seems that this woman is the proprietor of this liquor stall, from where my mother just bought the alcohol she used to revive me. The old man from the general store next door seems to have taken pity on me as well, and he waves me over.\n\n\n “Come and wait over here, missy, that way nobody’ll come by and try to snatch ya…”\n\n\n He motions me to a spot behind and between the two stalls and helps me sit down. It feels like the liquor that was poured down my throat is churning around inside me. Right now, moving around too much would be dangerous. If, for instance, I were to collapse from acute alcohol poisoning, nobody else would be able to figure out why.\n\n\n While sitting down, I idly look over the contents of the two shops. The liquor stand seems to have received a new shipment of cider, just in time for its most popular season, and customers come one right after the other to buy little casks of it. The general store, on the other hand, doesn’t have nearly as many customers.\n\n\n Just what does a general store sell in this world?\n\n\n I look over the various goods that are lined up for sale, but for the most part I have no idea what I’m looking at.\n\n\n “Mister, what’s thiiis?” I ask, pointing at one of the random things on a nearby shelf.\n\n\n “Oh, have you not used one of these before, little missy? This is what you use when you’re weavin’ cloth. Oh, and this one’s used for huntin’.”\n\n\n Since he doesn’t have any customers at the moment, the old man gladly explains what each thing does as I point at it in succession. There’s so much stuff here that’s used in daily life around here that I just don’t know anything about. I dig through Maine’s memories, but she either wasn’t very interested in these things or she never really learned about them.\n\n\n As I look around the items jumbled on the shelves in admiration, I notice something in the far corner. It may be just a single volume, but I definitely see the spine of some massive, bulky tome. It’s the kind of binding that I’d usually only see behind a glass case in a library, with a leather cover and fine gold caps on each of the corners. It’s so huge that I don’t think I’d be able to even hold it.\n\n\n …That’s a book! That, don’t tell me, that’s a book, right?!\n\n\n The instant I laid eyes on the spine of that book, color blasted back into my world. The heavy clouds that had weighed down on my mind were instantly driven away, and my very spirit was brightened in a moment.\n\n\n “M… mister!! What’s this?! What do you call this?!”\n\n\n “Ahh, that’s a book!”\n\n\n Yessss! I finally found one! Books, they exist! It might just only be one, but they exist!\n\n\n This book has scoured away my lingering depression from having been reborn into a world without any books. I tremble with emotion as I gaze longingly at its spine. It is absolutely too heavy for me to move, so it would merely be an ornament. From the looks of it, there’s no way that it isn’t prohibitively expensive, and there’s no way that I’ll be able to get my mother to buy it for me, no matter how much I pester her about it. However, if books like this exist, then there must be smaller, easier-to-carry books out there as well. I spin around to face the old man, eyes wide with raw hunger.\n\n\n “Hey, mister, where can I find a store that sells books?”\n\n\n “A store for books? There’s no store like that.” He gives me a what-the-hell-is-this-kid-talking-about look, and my excitement drops down a couple of notches. There’s books, so why are there no bookstores?\n\n\n “…Huh? Why? You’re selling one here.”\n\n\n “Books are only made when people transcribe them from the author’s original work, so they’re far too rare and valuable to just sell on the market. Even this one here ain’t actually for sale, it’s bein’ held as collateral for someone in the aristocracy. Well, if he don’t come back soon, I guess I’ll have to sell it, but the buyer’ll probably be another aristocrat.”\n\n\n Aristocrats!! If I were actually following the reborn-into-a-parallel-universe trope, I would have been born into the nobility! I would be able to read! Why am I just a commoner?!\n\n\n Thoughts of slaughtering the aristocracy flash through my mind. They’re surrounded by books from the minute they’re born. What have they done to deserve such a blessing?\n\n\n “Little missy, is this the first book you’ve ever seen?”\n\n\n I tear my eyes away from the book, nodding vigorously in reply to the old man’s question. Yes, this is the first book I’ve ever seen in this world. On top of that, they’re not usually for sale, and there’s no bookstores, and there’s a very good chance that such a chance encounter may never ever happen again. …and, so!!\n\n\n “M… mister!! Please, hear me out!”\n\n\n With my fists clasped tightly together, I stand straight up, then fall to my knees in front of the shopkeeper. “What’s all this now?” he says, wide-eyed in surprise as I kneel before him.\n\n\n This isn’t just an idle wish. What I need to demonstrate to this man is that this is the foundation at the heart of my foundation, and the most sincere demonstration in the world is begging on your hands and knees. I bow my head sharply, and do my best to explain my feelings as clearly and frankly as I can.\n\n\n “It may be obvious that I cannot buy that book, but, at least, let me touch it! Let me rub my face against it! At the very least, let me sniff it, let me breathe in the scent of its ink! Just that would be enough!!”\n\n\n …The silence that filled the air after my heartfelt request was almost to painful to bear, yet the shopkeeper gave no reply. Timidly, I raise my head to look up at him. For some reason, he looks like he’s swallowed a bug, or maybe like he’s spotted some unbelievably disgusting pervert. Shock and disgust play across his face as he looks down at me.\n\n\n Huh? Did my sincerity fail to shine through?\n\n\n “I… don’t know if I’m really understandin’ what you mean, but… I think it might be dangerous for me to let you touch that.”\n\n\n “B… but?!”\n\n\n I start to reiterate my passionate request, but my time is apparently up.\n\n\n “Maine, I’m done!” says my mother. “Let’s head home.”\n\n\n “Mommy…”\n\n\n Tears start falling from my eyes as soon as I hear her voice. The book’s right there, but I’ll never touch it. I’ll never smell it.\n\n\n “What’s wrong, Maine?” she asks me, concerned. A dangerous look flashes across her face, and she spins around to face the shopkeeper. “What did you do to her?!”\n\n\n I jump between them and shake my head vigorously. “N… nothing! Nothing!” If I don’t clear this misunderstanding up immediately, then I’d be just heaping more problems on the kind old man who let me take shelter in his shop and taught me about books. That’s no way to return a favor.\n\n\n “I don’t feel too good. Mommy, what did you make me drink? I’ve been feeling really funny since I woke up.”\n\n\n “……Ahhh, maybe the liquor I used to wake you up was a little too effective. Let’s get you home, get you some water, and get you a nice quiet place to rest. You’ll be all right.”\n\n\n My mother nods her head in understanding, but it doesn’t look like she’s thinking at all about whether or not it was a bad idea to have given alcohol to a child in the first place. She takes my hand, and with a tug starts pulling me back towards home. I look behind me as I walk away, and smile my biggest smile at the two shopkeepers.\n\n\n “Thanks for letting me sit down!”\n\n\n I didn’t bow, like I’m accustomed to, but not because I’m emotionally compromised. Rather, I don’t remember actually seeing anyone bowing their heads, so I don’t think that’s the custom here. For now, I’ll just keep smiling. A great smile is indispensable when dealing with other people, and from the way they’re smiling and waving back, it looks like my guess was correct.\n\n\n “Maine, are you still feeling bad?” asks my mother.\n\n\n “…Yeah.”\n\n\n We don’t say very much as we trudge home, hand in hand. I look at the shops along our route home, and, of course, there aren’t any bookstores. My goal for today of coercing my mother into getting me a children’s book and maybe learning a few letters has ended in complete failure. Even though this city is home to the lord of the land, even though we are surrounded by such spectacular walls, there’s no bookstore here. If books truly aren’t for sale, even here, then there might not be a bookstore anywhere in the world.\n\n\n I’m in despair. I had never thought that God could be so cruel as to force me, Urano Motosu, the book enthusiast who could go a day or two without eating as long as she had a book to read, to live a life bereft of books.\n\n\n At least, why wasn’t I born a noblewoman… Sniff! To reincarnate me as a peasant… God… what did I do to earn this hatred?\n\n\n Even if I say that I want my parents to become nobility so that they can buy me books, those are just childish fantasies. I’d never say that I don’t want to have been born into this family. Really, though, I want to be an aristocrat. If I can’t be an aristocrat, I at least want enough money to be able to buy all the books out of a disgraced aristocrat’s estate.\n\n\n I may be stuck in this awful environment, but I know for a fact that no matter how hard I cry, it’s not going to get me a book. If there aren’t any bookstores, I can’t buy a book.\n\n\n So, how am I going to get one?\n\n\n I’m just going to have to make them myself, aren’t I?\n\n\n Really, what I truly want are books from this world, but that’s an unreasonable luxury. In order to fulfill my most urgent desires, I’m going to have to put off learning how to read the language here. Instead, I’ll make books in Japanese, which I already know.\n\n\n I haven’t yet figured out how I’m going to do all that, but that doesn’t matter right now. I will definitely acquire a book!"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n My name’s Tory. I’m six years old. I have a little sister, Maine. She’s five.\n\n\n Maine has straight, dark blue hair, like the color of the night sky, and golden eyes that shine like the moon. I think she’s really adorable, but I am her older sister.\n\n\n She’s always really sick and always has a fever, so she doesn’t eat much, so she hasn’t grown very much. She also can’t go outside very much, so her skin is pale white. She’s really adorable, but I can’t play with her very much, which is a little disappointing. The other kids get to play with their brothers and sisters, and I get kinda jealous.\n\n\n The other day, Maine had a really bad fever. It was so bad that everyone in the family was worried, wondering if she would live or die. For three days, she didn’t eat anything, and she even got so weak that she couldn’t drink any water.\n\n\n The fever might have made her a little strange in the head.\n\n\n When she was sick, she started using words I didn’t really understand and getting really mad all of a sudden. She always used to do what she was told, but when I went to go wash the dishes, she snuck out of bed and I found her crying and I don’t know why. She spent the whole day crying…\n\n\n I though that maybe Maine was still suffering because of her fever, but when her fever went down, she got even weirder.\n\n\n Seriously, she started saying that her body felt gross and that she wanted to wipe herself off. When we boil water to cook our food, she asks if she could have some warm water for a bath. Every day!\n\n\n Every day, she wets a cloth and wipes her body off. “Help me with the parts I can’t reach,” she says, so I help her out. On the first day, the bath water got really dirty, but by the third day, it was still pretty clean.\n\n\n “You’re not really dirty, so isn’t taking a bath kind of a waste?” I asked, but she just said, “It’s not a waste, I am dirty!”\n\n\n Every day, she obsesses over making sure she washes herself off. Before I knew it, one of the corners of the bedroom had turned into her bathing space.\n\n\n Then, for some reason, she decided that I should start washing myself as well when I was helping her. “Sure, why not,” I said, and started scrubbing my face. “You go outside a lot,” she said, “so you get dirtier than me.”\n\n\n When I washed myself off, the water that Maine had left clean got really dirty and muddy. When I stared at all of the dirt that had been on me, I started feeling a little bit gross. Maine, though, was beaming. “If there’s two of us, it’s not a waste, right?” she said.\n\n\n What will it take to make her see that it really is a waste? I have to bring all of that water up from the well, and it’s really hard! Doesn’t she know that?\n\n\n After that, she suddenly started wearing her hair up. Her hair is really straight, so no matter how tightly we tie it back, it unties itself and comes down immediately, so we haven’t really been tying it back. After trying and failing to tie it back several times, Maine started to sulk. Suddenly, she got up and started rummaging around in our toy basket. She pulled out a doll that Dad had whittled out of wood and Mom had made clothes for… my most precious possession!\n\n\n “Tory, can I break this off?” she asked.\n\n\n “That’s my doll’s leg! Maine, that’s awful!!”\n\n\n It was terrifying that my little sister could so calmly ask to break off my doll’s leg. It was too cruel. When I got mad, she hung her head and mumbled “sorry”. Sighing, she ran her fingers through her hair, pushing her bangs back. Seeing a five-year-old do something so strangely sensual made my breath stop for a moment.\n\n\n “Tory, if I wanted a stick like this, what should I do?”\n\n\n What Maine really wanted wasn’t my doll’s leg, it was a wooden rod. So, I got a stick from the kindling pile. Instead of letting her break my doll, I used a knife to whittle the stick down into a little rod. She had a lot of requests, like “make this part a little skinnier” or “could you round the ends off to make them less sharp”, but eventually she was satisfied.\n\n\n “Thanks, Tory!”\n\n\n With a big smile, Maine took the rod from me, then suddenly jammed it through her own head.\n\n\n “Maine?!” I yelled, startled.\n\n\n Maine started to turn the rod, which she had actually stuck through her hair, winding her hair tightly around it. Somehow, she put all of her hair up, with just that one little rod. I was surprised how firmly it stayed in place. It was like the magic the nobility uses! However, her hairstyle looked very adult.\n\n\n “Maine,” I say, “you can’t put all of your hair up! Only grown-ups do that.”\n\n\n “…Oh, really?”\n\n\n With wide eyes, like she really didn’t know, she reached up and pulled the rod out of her hair. Immediately, her hair came undone and fell around her shoulders. Then, she grabs just the top part of her hair, and wraps it up like she did before.\n\n\n “Is this okay?” she asks.\n\n\n “I think so, yeah!”\n\n\n After that, Maine started to always wear her hair up like that. She looks like she has a stick through her head if you look at her from the front, but she seems happy with it.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n A little while later, Mom was able to take a day off from work, and I was finally able to go out into the forest with everyone else. I gathered a lot of firewood, and was also able to find a lot of forest mushrooms, as well as some herbs that we can use to season the meat. We need to be preparing for the winter, so all of the kids are working hard to gather things.\n\n\n “I’m home,” I say, as I walk through the door. “Welcome back, Tory,” replies Mom.\n\n\n “What did you get? Show me, show me!” says Maine, digging around in my basket like this was a rare and unusual thing. I did this just the other day, but Maine… yeah, when I think about it, Maine’s being weird lately.\n\n\n “Aha, this! Can I have this!”\n\n\n With gleaming eyes, she pulls a melia fruit out of my basket. Maine doesn’t ask for things very often, so I thought it would be okay to give her two of them.\n\n\n “Thanks, Tory!” she says, beaming like an angel. She runs off into the storage room, then comes back out, looking like everything in the world is absolutely perfect.\n\n\n “Maine, why are y…”\n\n\n As soon as I started to speak, Maine suddenly swung a hammer and, with a thud, smashed the melia. It splits apart with a squish, and the juice inside splatters all over my face.\n\n\n “……”\n\n\n “……”\n\n\n When you smash it with a hammer, of course the juices are going to splatter everywhere, you know? Surely you know that without having to think about it, right?\n\n\n “So, Maine. What are you doing?” I ask, trying to put on a smile as I wipe the splattered juice from my face. With a weird sort of “whee!” noise, she jumps up with a start.\n\n\n “…Ummmm, so, yeah. I wanted some oil,” she says, with a oh-no-now-I’ve-done-it sort of facial expression. She looks up at me, as if asking for help. This is definitely the face of a girl that absolutely didn’t realize that smashing something with a hammer would send pieces flying everywhere.\n\n\n “If you wanted oil, you know there’s better ways to make it, right?! What are you doing?!”\n\n\n “Oh, I see…” she says, dejectedly.\n\n\n Is she really okay? Does she really not remember back when we pressed vais oil together? Oh no, maybe she had a fever for too long and she’s gone funny in the head! …I should ask Mom about this, shouldn’t I?\n\n\n Afterwards, when we were in the middle of cleaning up, Mom came back inside, carrying water from the well for our dinner. Of course, she got mad. This was all Maine’s fault, but she got mad at both of us, because I wasn’t a very good older sister. Right then, Maine didn’t seem very adorable at all.\n\n\n “Tory, Tory,” she asked, “How do you make oil? Teach me?”\n\n\n Since Mom was in such a huff, Maine stealthily made her way over to me to ask her question. Her sneaking was completely visible. Look, Mom’s watching us right now.\n\n\n “Mom,” I ask, “Can I teach Maine?”\n\n\n Mom sighs. “If we don’t teach her, she’s probably going to do something awful like this again.” She points at the storage room. “Please, show her how to do it.”\n\n\n All of the tools we need to make oil are in the storage room, so I get a cloth and take Maine in there with me.\n\n\n “…A wooden table like the one in the kitchen is just going to soak up the oils and juices, so we can’t use that one. The metal table like here is better. First thing we need to do is spread a cloth out on the table. Then, we need to wrap the fruit in a cloth like this so that the pieces don’t fly everywhere.”\n\n\n Melia fruit are edible, so we usually get the oil out of the seeds after we’ve finished eating. Maine, however, was very insistent that there’s oil in the fruit, too.\n\n\n She brought the hammer down with glee, over and over, but her aim wasn’t very good, she wasn’t very strong, and her posture was all wrong. She smashed up the fruit pretty well, but she wasn’t able to smash any of the seeds. To make things worse, when we were done smashing up the seeds, we would need to wring the cloth out, and Maine doesn’t have nearly enough strength to do that.\n\n\n “Maine, that’s not working. You’re not smashing the seeds, you know?”\n\n\n “Ooh… …Toooryyyyy…”\n\n\n She looked up at me with such a pitiful expression that I decided to help out. I took the hammer from her, but it was so sticky and slippery with juice already that it nearly slipped from my hands. Sighing, I wiped off the handle, and gripped it tightly.\n\n\n “This is how we do it…”\n\n\n If Dad were doing this, he wouldn’t be using a hammer. He’d get something really heavy to put on top of it and press the oil out of it without doing a whole lot of work. Boys are expected to do manual labor as they grow up, so they can lift heavy weights like that. I can’t, though, so I had to smash those seeds one by one with a hammer.\n\n\n “And now, we wring out the cloth…”\n\n\n “Whoa! Tory, you’re amazing!”\n\n\n The oil drips into a small dish as I wring out the cloth. As Maine watches, the look of pure joy on her face is extremely adorable. My arms, however, extremely hurt.\n\n\n “Thanks, Tory!” she says.\n\n\n “Hey, don’t run off, help me clean up!”\n\n\n Maine seemed confused, like she didn’t quite know what to do to help, so I helped show her how to clean up all of the tools we used.\n\n\n Maine has a weak constitution and is much shorter than other kids her age, so it’s easy to forget that she’s already five. When she turns seven, she’ll be baptized at the temple, and she’ll have to find someplace to start an apprenticeship.\n\n\n Not only that, but next year I’m going to be turning seven. I’m going to start my apprenticeship, so Maine’s going to have to be able to do half of the housework by then. She doesn’t even know where the tools go or how to clean them right now, so I don’t know if she’s going to be okay.\n\n\n We’re going to keep an eye on her health, but we have to gradually start making her help out with the housework. Otherwise, Maine as she is right now isn’t really going to be able to find work. Mom’s going to have to stop pampering her, and I, her big sister, am going to have to teach her everything she needs to know.\n\n\n “Tory,” said Maine, “Can I have some herbs too?”\n\n\n “Just a little?”\n\n\n “Yeah!”\n\n\n With a serious face, Maine went through the herbs she took from my basket, sniffing them each and adding a few of them to her oil. She’s probably trying to change the scent of it, but some of the herbs she’s using are used to keep bugs away, and they’ll make it too smelly to eat.\n\n\n Whoa… shouldn’t I get this into our food before that finishes happening?\n\n\n I immediately started to try to add the melia oil to the pot, but Maine cut me off with a frantic expression.\n\n\n “Tory, no! What are you doing?!”\n\n\n “If we don’t eat this soon,” I said, “we won’t be able to use it at all! These herbs are going to change the flavor so much that we’re not going to be able to eat it, you know?”\n\n\n “No, don’t eat it!”\n\n\n No matter what I said, Maine just kept shaking her head and trying to hide the bowl the oil was in. Eventually, Mom got bothered enough that she looked over at what we were doing, and she started getting angry as well.\n\n\n “Maine!” she yelled. “Those are things that Tory went and gathered! Don’t be selfish!”\n\n\n “I’m not selfish! Tory gave these to me!”\n\n\n No matter how mad Mom got, Maine still wouldn’t listen. When even the two of us couldn’t make her change her mind, we finally gave up, and Maine went off to wash herself off as usual.\n\n\n Then, she suddenly dumped about half of the oil into her bath water and started mixing it up! Now we really couldn’t eat it. And I’d spent so much trouble finding those, too!\n\n\n “Maine! What are you doing!” “Eh? I’m washing, you know?”\n\n\n I couldn’t understand what Maine was doing, even when she tried to tell me. Lately, this has been happening more and more. As I watched, dumbfounded, Maine soaked her hair in the bucket and started to wash it. She splashed the part soaking in the water around, then started repeatedly scrubbing at the top of her head. When she seemed satisfied, she tightly wrung out all of the excess water out of her hair, then used a cloth to start drying it. When she was finished, she combed it out straight.\n\n\n Her deep blue hair was suddenly so much smoother and silkier that it was positively radiant.\n\n\n “…What… is this?” I ask.\n\n\n “Ummm, a \"simple 2-in-1 shampoo”.“1\n\n\n \"Huh?”\n\n\n “Do you want to use it to, Tory? If both of us use it, it won’t be a waste!”\n\n\n After seeing how beautiful Maine had suddenly become, I kind of wanted to try it. I wanted to try being that beautiful.\n\n\n However, I had been so mad at her just a little while ago that I felt awkward using it. Though, when Maine reminded me that I was the one who’d found the melia and pressed it for oil, the awkwardness blew away.\n\n\n When you think about it like that, didn’t I do literally all of the preparation work?\n\n\n Hesitantly, I undid my braid, then lowered my hair into the bucket and washed it like Maine had done. Maine helped too, and her tiny hands helped to wash the parts I missed.\n\n\n “I think it’s good now?”\n\n\n After drying it a bunch and combing it out, my hair was as glossy as Maine’s. Although it had always been really poofy and frizzy and impossible to comb out, now it was gentle and wavy. It’s almost like magic.\n\n\n “You’re so beautiful!” says Maine. “Tory, you smell nice.”\n\n\n She seems pleased, for some reason, as she combs out my hair. I was delighted that I’d become so beautiful… but, how did Maine learn how to do this?\n\n\n Maine really has gotten weird. If she gets weirder like this every time she has a fever… that’s a terrifying thought.\n\n\n …Although, when Mom freaked out when she saw us as we cleaned up Maine’s bucket, I started wondering what Maine would get up to next. I might be looking forward to it, just a little."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Since I don’t have any books, I’ll make some myself.\n\n\n Ever since I decided on that particular course of action, my mood has improved drastically, and I’ve been way more forward-thinking. Trouble is, there isn’t a single scrap of paper in this house. This is something I know from my earlier home explorations. So, I need to go and buy paper, but I have no idea where I’d find it. Trouble is, this town doesn’t have any convenience stores, hardware stores, supermarkets, or stationery shops.\n\n\n Well, where the heck do I go to buy paper? The old man at the general store said that you have to copy books by hand if you want them, so I think there might be blank books available for sale. Although, where the heck do I find those? Perhaps there’s a store that deals exclusively in paper.\n\n\n If I were in Japan, I’d be done in an instant. I’d write everything out on loose-leaf in a binder, or in a notebook, or on stapled-together printer paper. Here, though, there’s no end to my problems.\n\n\n There isn’t any paper in the house, so I’m going to need to start searching for some if I want to have any chance of making a book. My mother went to work this morning, so right now at home there’s just Tory and me. Of course, this means there’s only one person around to interrogate.\n\n\n “Tory,” I ask, “Do you know where to buy ‘paper’?”\n\n\n “Hm? What did you say?” she replies.\n\n\n “'Paper’! Where do I go to… oh!”\n\n\n Tory looks at me quizzically, her braided hair swinging as she tilts her head to one side. This is the face of someone who doesn’t understand the Japanese word I just used.\n\n\n Not good. I don’t know how to say “paper” in this language. Argh! I really should have asked the old guy at the general store what it was called!\n\n\n “…you wouldn’t know, huh?”\n\n\n “Sorry, Maine,” says Tory, “I guess I don’t. That’s a funny word, though.”\n\n\n I hang my head with a dramatic jerk, and let out a deep sigh. The truth is, not knowing where to buy paper is just one of my problems. I also have no idea where to find pencils or pens. Based on what I’ve seen of this city, I doubt anything like a mechanical pencil or a ballpoint exists. Even fountain pens might be unlikely.\n\n\n Well then, what should I use a writing implement? And, of course, where should I go to find it? And, above all, I’m certainly not able to go out, by myself, in order to buy all of these materials. This really is troublesome.\n\n\n “Ah!” exclaims Tory, from the kitchen. “Dad forgot this!”\n\n\n I make my way over to the kitchen, where Tory is holding a bundle.\n\n\n Sure enough, this looks like the thing from this morning, where our father had suddenly said “I need that thing for work, can you get it out for me” and our mother had gotten mad and shot back “why didn’t you ask me earlier”, then she frantically tore apart the storage room looking for it. Thinking about how mad she would be if she were to find out that our father had then forgotten that thing sends shivers down my spine.\n\n\n “Tory, Mommy’s going to be mad, right?”\n\n\n “You think so too, Maine?”\n\n\n I don’t know if it’s this family or this world, but people here are very forthright about their emotions. When they laugh, it’s with a booming voice and an idiotic grin, and when they’re mad, they burn like a raging fire. In other words, my mother’s explosive anger is terrifying.\n\n\n “Tory, should we take this to Daddy?” I ask.\n\n\n “…Ummm, well, leaving you alone is, uh…”\n\n\n When she had stepped outside for just a moment to wash the dishes, I snuck out of the bedroom and then cried my eyes out. When I had gone out shopping with our mother, I fainted and collapsed in a heap. My family’s estimation of me is probably scraping rock bottom, so Tory probably isn’t going to let me out of her sight.\n\n\n “If Daddy doesn’t have this he’ll be in trouble, right?”\n\n\n “…Maine, are you able to walk all the way to the gates?”\n\n\n Rather than leaving me alone, it looks like we’re going to go out together. Thinking of the distance between here and the town market makes me a little bit uneasy, but my mother’s wrath is far more terrifying. I clench my fist and put on my bravest face.\n\n\n “I’ll… I’ll do it!” I say.\n\n\n “Well, let’s go, then.”\n\n\n Package in hand, we depart, bundled up in our countless layers of clothing. Although we may be wearing many layers, we are not at all fashionable in the slightest. This is entirely for protection from the cold.\n\n\n By the way, my selection of clothing includes two pairs of underwear, two woolen one-piece dresses, one knitted woolen sweater, two pairs of knit pants that are kind of like long johns, and two pairs of socks, also knitted out of wool. I am wearing every single piece of it.\n\n\n “Tory, isn’t this too heavy to move in?” I had asked, while we were bundling up.\n\n\n “If we don’t wear it all, though, the wind’s going to break in through the patches and seams, you know? You catch cold super easily too, so you definitely have to wear everything.”\n\n\n There had been no arguing with my mother when she made me do this, but I briefly entertained the notion that maybe I’d be able to push back against Tory. She, however, was adamant that I dress appropriately to keep myself healthy. I surrendered to her strong sense of responsibility and put everything on. Thanks to that, it’s very hard to move right now.\n\n\n Tory is really fit, so even though she’s bundled up just as tightly as I am, she’s as nimble as she usually is. To make things worse, she’s always going out to collect firewood with the other children and run errands for our mother, so she’s used to walking around a lot. I, on the other hand, am neither strong nor fast. And I’m wearing a ton of clothing.\n\n\n “Maine, are you alright?” “Haaah… haaah…” I pant, “If we go… a little slower… I’ll be fine.”\n\n\n Just like last time, I’m out of breath after climbing down all those stairs. I walk at my own pace. If I push it too hard and collapse, I’m just going to burden Tory even more. It’s important for me to start building her trust in me back up.\n\n\n Even so, walking on cobblestones is haaaard…\n\n\n They’re extremely uneven, so if you aren’t paying too much attention to where you step, your foot will get caught and you’ll fall on your face. I hold onto Tory’s hand, letting her do the navigating while I concentrate on putting my feet in the right place.\n\n\n From a little ways away, a boy’s voice rings out. “Oh hey, it’s Tory! What are you up to?”\n\n\n I raise my head. Three boys, wearing wooden backpacks and carrying bows, come running up to us. With red, blond, and pink hair, the trio is certainly eye-catchingly colorful.\n\n\n Their clothing might have originally been dyed, but years of dirt and food stains have made them a mottled gray. They seem like hand-me-downs, covered in patches. It’s not that different than what I’m wearing, so their standard of living is probably the same as ours.\n\n\n “Ah, Ralph! And Lutz and Fey too!”\n\n\n Since Tory seems so friendly with these three, it’s likely that Maine has some sort of connection to them as well. I scrunch up my forehead in concentration, digging through Maine’s memories.\n\n\n Ah, yep, there it is. Oh, they’re the neighborhood kids.\n\n\n Ralph, same age as Tory. He’s redheaded and is the strongest. The leader of the kids, gives off an atmosphere as if he’s everyone’s big brother.\n\n\n Fey, also the same age as Tory. Pink-haired, with the kind of mischievous face you’d see on the worst kind of prankster. He and Maine never got very close, maybe because of the differences in their constitution, so she doesn’t have very many memories of him.\n\n\n Lutz, Ralph’s younger brother and the same age as me. He tries to act like he’s my older brother, but he comes across like a cute little boy that wants to grow up.\n\n\n The three of them seem to be part of Tory’s usual party when she heads off to the forest, and it seems like they sometimes brought Maine along with them. The memories of those few outings seem much clearer than Maine’s other memories.\n\n\n While my focus was turned inward as I dug through my memory, Tory had struck up a lively conversation with Ralph.\n\n\n “My dad forgot something, so we’re going to the gates to bring it to him,” she says. “You guys going to the forest?”\n\n\n “Yeah. Wanna go to the gate together?”\n\n\n “Sure!”\n\n\n When I see how her face lights up as she talks to Ralph, I realize how much trouble I’m putting her through every day. Of course heading off to the forest with your friends is way more fun than babysitting, isn’t it? I’m sorry for being such a drag of a little sister. Although, my fever has been down for a few days, so it should be okay for me to start going out again. Specifically, to go out and find a store that will sell me some paper.\n\n\n When the other kids had just joined up with us, they’d started going at my speed, but Tory suddenly sped up. Since we’re holding hands, I’m pulled along with her. Quickly, my feet get tangled together.\n\n\n “Whoaaaa!”\n\n\n “Maine?!” Tory immediately stops moving, so I don’t fall flat on my face, but I do scrape my knee. “I’m so sorry! Are you okay?”\n\n\n “…Yeah.”\n\n\n My knee doesn’t hurt very much, but now that I’ve sat down, standing up seems so hard. I just want to rest a little. As I think about how oppressive this situation is, Lutz offers me his hand.\n\n\n “…Hey, Maine. Want to ride on my pack?”\n\n\n Lutz, you’re such a good kid!\n\n\n According to Maine’s memories, Ralph and Fey are always acting like they’re better than Lutz, so even though he’s the same age as Maine, he tries to act like her older brother, especially because she’s so small and weak. Whenever she started getting too exhausted, he’d take her pack so she could keep going. What a gentleman!\n\n\n On top of that, his blond hair is a color that I’m actually used to seeing, unlike pink or green, which is comforting.\n\n\n “Maine, are you getting another fever? If it’s getting too hard, I can carry you.”\n\n\n Lutz seems so happy. Seriously, he does! However, even though he’s bigger than me, we’re still the same age, so having him carry me on his back might be kind of bad…\n\n\n As I worry about what I should do, Ralph sighs a little, then puts down his backpack.\n\n\n “Lutz,” he says, “if you’re carrying her, it’ll take us forever to get to the forest. I’ll carry Maine. Lutz, you take my bow, Fey, you take my backpack.”\n\n\n “Ralph…”\n\n\n Lutz scowls resentfully at Ralph. He must feel like his good deed was just snatched away from him.\n\n\n I grab his hand tightly. “You were the first to help me, Lutz,” I say, smiling broadly. “You’re so kind. Thanks! You made me happy.”\n\n\n Being praised for noticing me seems to be enough for Lutz. He smiles shyly, and takes Ralph’s bow without complaint.\n\n\n If you praise a child for being kind, they’ll keep that kindness with them as they grow up. I’m speaking, of course, from my adult perspective.\n\n\n “Hey, come here,” says Ralph, beckoning.\n\n\n “Okay! Thanks, Ralph,” I reply.\n\n\n Ralph is just a little bit bigger than Tory. I lean my weight against his back. There’s no need here for the shyness of a little girl. No need at all. With me riding securely on his back, Ralph starts walking at a steady pace.\n\n\n My field of view is about thirty to forty centimeters higher than it usually is, and the world looks so different from up here. Or, more precisely, I don’t have to keep my eyes on the ground to avoid tripping, so I can actually look around freely. On top of that, Ralph doesn’t have to slow down to match my usual pace, so the scenery is flowing by at a steady rate.\n\n\n “Whoa, I’m so high!” I exclaim. “So fast, too!”\n\n\n “Don’t get too excited, okay?” he says. “You’ll get sick again.”\n\n\n “Yeah! I’ll be careful.”\n\n\n Eh heh heh, being a frail little girl has its advantages~! Even better, boys who keep going to the forest to get firewood are pretty strong. He’s got way more muscle than you’d expect from a kid.\n\n\n If I compare these people to my recollection of what Japanese elementary schoolers are like, there is a significant difference in physique. This might not be a fair comparison, though; not only is the lifestyle very different, but these people are of a different race.\n\n\n Another thing I shouldn’t be comparing to Japan is the scenery. Thin streams of filth ooze out from the narrow alleys, and the pack mules that wander up and down the main street are walking through piles of their own sh*t…\n\n\n It’s… it’s not like I’ve been specifically staring at the filth! This is just the kind of spectacle that you’d never see in Japan, so I was a little surprised, so of course my eyes were drawn to it!\n\n\n Unlike when I had gone out to the town market, the streets are filled with people going to work, so I can’t see into any of the first-floor shops as we go past. The shops that deal only in commodities have glass windows, but from here, all I can see are the signs hung above the doors. To make things worse, all of the buildings along the street are of similar color and design, so my eyes are, of course, drawn to anything that stands out in the slightest. It’s not my fault!\n\n\n “You okay, Ralph?” asks Tory, looking a little concerned. “Maine isn’t too heavy?”\n\n\n Ralph shifts me around slightly with a jolt, securing his grip. He turns his head away a little. “I said it was okay,” he says, curtly. “Maine’s really tiny, and she’s light. If we let her walk, wouldn’t it trouble you more?”\n\n\n I can sympathize with the shy expression on Tory’s troubled face, and I want to help her out. Aren’t you supposed to be thanking her right now?\n\n\n …Oh ho! Ralph’s just a boy! Perhaps he’s interested in Tory? He’s trying to use me to get into her heart. I don’t particularly mind, though. Alright, let’s make this puppy love happen!\n\n\n …Of course, this is just my particular delusion. The both of them are still very young, so they probably aren’t able to really feel true love… but I have no books to keep me busy, so at least let me have my fantasies.\n\n\n Then, Ralph suddenly says “Tory, you smell… nice,” acting so smooth as he smells her hair. What the hell, kid, do you think you’re the hero of a YA romance novel? Then, of course, Tory blushes shyly and says “Really? Thanks…”\n\n\n I may not have very many bittersweet experiences under my own belt, even at 22, but Tory is so ridiculously sweet at six years old that it’s only natural for me to have these sorts of thoughts, right?\n\n\n I never used to pay it any mind when people told me that I’d never have any sort of male presence in my life if I just stayed in my dream world, reading my books and lost in my fantasies. It wasn’t just my family telling me this; even Shuu from next door kept saying it. None of your business! Idiots. Idiots!\n\n\n While I was distracted by my irritating memories of Japan, Ralph and Tory’s puppy love has blossomed into a proper reverse harem, with Tory in the middle.\n\n\n “Oh, yeah! It does smell good!”\n\n\n “What? What?”\n\n\n Fey and Lutz have also moved in on Tory, smelling her braided hair. They’re all about the same age, so this is definitely a reverse harem.\n\n\n “Whoa, your hair is super glossy!”\n\n\n “What did you do to it?”\n\n\n Eh heh heh. That’s right, that’s right!\n\n\n Satisfied with the surprised reactions of the reverse harem’s members, I nod approvingly from my vantage point on Ralph’s back. I’ve keeping a potpourri of dried flowers in our clothing box, boiling water at dinner time so that Tory and I can give ourselves sponge baths, washing our hair with herb oils and carefully brushing it out, and, bit by bit, bringing up the level of hygiene in our house.\n\n\n It looks like my efforts are finally starting to pay off!\n\n\n Incidentally, Ralph and co. are a little bit on the smelly side. Everything around here stinks, so I’ve somewhat gotten used to it, but things that stink still stink. Although I’d never say it out loud, from my position on Ralph’s back, I can definitely say that he stinks.\n\n\n I really want to make everyone start washing with soap. The only soap kept at home is a foul-smelling animal-based soap that’s used for cleaning and doing laundry. Nobody has any nice-smelling vegetable-based soaps to wash themselves with, which is terrible.\n\n\n Aaaah, even just hand soap would be nice…\n\n\n As I spaced out, lost in my own thoughts, Lutz suddenly tugs on my hair, sniffing it like he did to Tory’s. “Maine, you smell good too! I can see your face really well with your hair up like that too, you look really cute.”\n\n\n He gazes innocently at me with his pale green eyes.\n\n\n Not good! Lutz, your color scheme is too good! Blond hair and green eyes, that’s the recipe for a really hot dude!\n\n\n Noooooooo! My opponent is a child, why am I suddenly so shy?! I know he has zero intentions, but the framing of this scene is just too awkward! Please, stop! I should be old enough to know better, but I have no experience with these things! I can’t cope!!\n\n\n I’m the only one here who’s trying to keep their heart from doing backflips. Everyone else is already talking about the things they’re going to find in the forest or when they think the first snowfall of the season will come. Ignoring how I’m about to faint, Lutz is bragging about how much better he’s gotten at shooting his bow lately. Unlike Tory, who’s shyly thanking everyone for their help, I can barely say a word. My heart is pounding again.\n\n\n For five and six year olds to do this stuff so calmly, is this normal?! What’s with this world! What’s a humble, shy, pure girl to do? Will my heart be stained by evil?\n\n\n …Don’t you dare ask who I was calling a pure girl!"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n As I cling to Ralph’s back, my legs dangling, the gates of the outer wall come into view.\n\n\n The outer wall was built to protect the town, so it’s considerably taller than other buildings nearby. It’s about two or three stories tall by Japanese standards, and it’s quite thick. It has gates at each of the cardinal directions, at which it seems that several soldiers are stationed in order to check incoming travelers.\n\n\n The gate ahead is the south gate, and I can see several soldiers standing there. One of them is probably my father. I can’t tell which one is him, but it looks like Tory knows. She clutches the bundle close to her chest, and runs forward, waving her arm.\n\n\n “Father!” she calls.\n\n\n Our father looks surprised. “Tory, what’s the matter?”\n\n\n “You left something at the house!” says Tory, beaming as she hands over the bundle. “We came to bring it to you.”\n\n\n Tory, you’re so kind. You’re too kind! If it were me talking to my previous father, I wouldn’t have said anything nearly so kind. My true feelings would probably have slipped out, something like “Mom would be pissed if she found out you’d left this at the house, and that would be a huge bother. Did you forget what happened this morning?”\n\n\n “Ahh, I’m saved!” he says, reaching out to take the bundle with a sigh of relief. “…Hm? Did you leave Maine by herself?!”\n\n\n Father scowls. It seems that he hadn’t noticed anyone except for his beloved daughter Tory, so he had completely ignored Ralph’s group and missed me, his other beloved daughter, clinging to Ralph’s back. Tory shakes her head vigorously, and points over at Ralph.\n\n\n “Nuh uh, she came too! Look, she’s riding on Ralph’s back.”\n\n\n “Huh? Oh! I see.” He glances around, feeling a little embarrassed that he hadn’t noticed us, then pats Ralph on the head. “Sorry you had to carry her all this way, Ralph.”\n\n\n “We were going to the forest, so it was on our way,” says Ralph, looking a little bothered by how my father is ruffling his hair. He sets me down, then goes to collect the stuff that Fey and Lutz were holding for him.\n\n\n “Thanks, Ralph,” says my father. “Lutz and Fey, you too.”\n\n\n We see off Ralph and his friends as they head through the gate on their way to the forest, then Tory and I head to the gate’s waiting room. The wall here is thick enough that you could probably put a three meter by four meter room in it. This room isn’t nearly that large, so it looks like there’s both a waiting room and a room for the night watch in here. The waiting room is very simple, with a table, a few chairs, and a cabinet.\n\n\n I look around excitedly, feeling like I’m visiting a foreign country for the first time. After a little while, one of my father’s coworkers brings us some water.\n\n\n “You two are such good kids, bringing your dad something he forgot.”\n\n\n It took us about twenty minutes, going at Tory’s pace, to get from our home to the gate, so I’m incredibly grateful to finally get some water. I gulp back all of the water in the wooden cup I’ve been given, then let out a huge sigh.\n\n\n “Ahhh, delicious! I’ve been revived!”\n\n\n “Maine,” says Tory with a frown, “didn’t you barely walk at all?”\n\n\n At those words, everyone starts laughing. I try to look upset, but I really can’t object since everyone saw Ralph carrying me in. I help myself to another cup of water as everyone laughs at me.\n\n\n Another soldier enters the room. He grabs a wooden box, which seems to be some kind of toolbox, from the shelves, then immediately heads back out. Unintentionally, I frown a little at how hectic things seem to be.\n\n\n “Daddy,” I ask, “Did something happen?”\n\n\n “It’s probably just someone who needs special attention coming through the gates. Nothing to worry about.”\n\n\n My father may be waving his hand dismissively while saying not to pay it any mind, but I can’t help but worry a little when I see a busy situation like that. Are things really okay?\n\n\n I mean, this is a gate. The gatekeepers are riled up, you know? Isn’t this a danger flag?\n\n\n In contrast to my worries, Tory is just sitting there, looking like there’s no danger at all, with her head tilted to one side. “What kind of person needs special attention?” she asks. “Have I seen them before?”\n\n\n It looks like Tory can’t think of anyone who would rile up the guards like this, even though she travels through this gate fairly often. Our father rubs thoughtfully at the stubble on his chin for a moment before answering.\n\n\n “Uhhh, perhaps its someone who looks like a bad person who committed a crime. Or, maybe, it’s an arriving aristocrat that we need to inform the lord about.”\n\n\n “Oh…”\n\n\n If he says that someone looks like a criminal, then it seems like they pass judgement just based on how someone looks. Although, if I think about how things work around here, it seems unlikely that they have any real way to transmit information around, so they probably have no choice but to stop and investigate every suspicious-looking individual.\n\n\n “We’ll have them wait in another room while the higher-ups decide if it’s okay to let them into the city.”\n\n\n Ahh, so that means that there must be several waiting rooms around the gate. I get it now. Surely, there must be significant differences between the rooms for the nobility and rooms for criminals, from the size of them to the quality of the furniture. Life’s unfair, no matter what world you’re in.\n\n\n While I contemplate these things, the young soldier returns, bringing back the wooden box as well as some sort of cylindrical, pipe-like item. There wasn’t even a trace of any tension on his face, like you’d expect from an emergency situation. Looks like my father was right, this is no big deal.\n\n\n The soldier, with cargo in his left hand, walks up to my father, raises his right fist, then thumps the left side of his chest twice. My father stands up, straightens himself, and returns the gesture. This is probably this world’s salute.\n\n\n “Otto, I’ll leave the report to you,” says my father, with a stern, commanding expression that I’ve never seen at home.\n\n\n “Ohh,” I murmur, appreciatively. I haven’t seen him do anything but laze around, so this is really fresh. His expression is sharp, and he actually looks really cool.\n\n\n “Count Lowenwalt wishes for the rampart gates to be opened, sir,” says Otto.\n\n\n “His seal?”\n\n\n “Has been verified, sir.”\n\n\n “Right, he can pass.”\n\n\n Otto salutes once more, then sits down in the chair across from me. He sets the wooden box down on the table next to him, then uses both hands to spread the other thing out. It isn’t as smooth as paper, and it has some sort of smell to it, but my eyes snap to it immediately.\n\n\n Parchment?!\n\n\n I don’t know if it really is parchment, but it definitely is some kind of paper that has properties like it was made out of animal skin. I can’t read anything it says, but there are words written there using the alphabet of this world. Before my staring eyes, Otto takes from the box an inkwell and a reed pen, then starts to write something down on the parchment.\n\n\n Whoooooooooooa!! Writing! There is a person who can write here!! This is the first civilized man I have met in this world. I absolutely want him to teach me how to read this language!\n\n\n As I think, my gaze is fixed on Otto’s hands as if I were going to devour them. My dad places a hand on my head and ruffles my hair. “What is it?” he asks.\n\n\n I look up at my father, then point at the parchment-looking thing. If I don’t figure out what it’s called, I won’t be able to ask about it in the future. “Daddy, Daddy! What’s that?” I ask.\n\n\n “Ah, that’s parchment!” he says. “It’s a paper made from the skin of goats or sheep.”\n\n\n “What’s this black stuff?”\n\n\n “That’s ink, and that’s a pen.”\n\n\n As I thought! I’ve found paper and ink, so I can make books. I’m so happy that I could start dancing, but I try to stay calm. I clasp my hands tightly in front of me, look endearingly up at my father, and start begging with all my might.\n\n\n “Hey, Daddy. Can I have that?”\n\n\n “No, Maine, that’s not a kid’s toy.”\n\n\n Even though I’d tried to project every last mote of adorable little girl charm, he rejected my pleas immediately. Of course, just because I’ve been shot down, doesn’t mean I’m not going to stop trying.\n\n\n When it comes to books, I clamp down on them like a snapping turtle and stick to them like gum on a shoe. You really shouldn’t underestimate my adhesion!\n\n\n “I wanna write like this! I really do. Pleeeease!”\n\n\n “You just can’t, Maine! You don’t even know how to write.”\n\n\n Certainly, if you don’t know how to write, then you don’t need any paper or ink. For this very reason, now’s my greatest chance to twist my father’s words back around.\n\n\n “Ah, I’ll learn if you teach me! If I learn, then can I have that?”\n\n\n The younger, lower-ranked soldier can write, so it’s likely that my father, who seems to be his superior, can write as well. I never would have thought that someone who knew how to write would live in a house without a single sheet of paper, but I’m happy to have been proven wrong. If my father can teach me how to read and write, then reading the books of this world is no longer an impossible dream.\n\n\n As I sit there with a huge smile plastered over my face, feeling like I’ve gotten one step closer to realizing my ambitions, someone lets out a muffled snort. I look around, trying to find the source, and see Otto barely holding in his laughter, as if our father-daughter conversations about pen and ink are almost too much to bear.\n\n\n “Ahahaha, ‘teach me’, she says… heh heh, sir, aren’t you pretty bad at writing?”\n\n\n With a sharp snap, cracks spiderwebbed throughout my ambition. My smile freezes on my face, like someone’s dumped a bucket of ice water all over me.\n\n\n “Huh? Daddy, can you not write?”\n\n\n “I can read, more-or-less, and write too. My job involves paperwork, so I need to know how to read, but I’ve never really needed to know any characters outside of the ones I use at work. Just enough so that I can write down the names of people who come from far away, after I hear them.”\n\n\n “Ohhh…,” I sigh, staring at my father with a sullen expression on my face as he makes his excuses. So, it seems that my father’s literacy level is such that he’s only got a basic grasp of the alphabet to the point where if his class assignment was to write out his friend’s names then he could. The young Otto, though, said “pretty bad”, so he must be on the level of a first grader, who’d still make some mistakes with his classmate’s names. To be frank: worthless.\n\n\n “Hey now, don’t look at your father like that!” says Otto, the person who caused my opinion of my father to drop so dramatically, with a nervouse look on his face as he scolds me. Then, as if he’s covering for my father, he starts to explain the duties of a soldier.\n\n\n “The job of a soldier is to keep the peace in the town, but when there’s big events that the nobility put on, the knights usually are the ones who get the written instructions, and for smaller events all of the coordination is done verbally. We don’t really see a lot of different characters. Just being able to write people’s names is enough.”\n\n\n My father had a chance to pull himself together while Otto was covering for him, and has pulled his pride back together. It seems like my unimpressed stare hurt his feelings unexpectedly much.\n\n\n “Barely anyone knows how to read amongst the peasantry, except for the village leaders. I’m pretty amazing already, you know!” he says, his chest puffed out.\n\n\n “Whoa, you really are amazing, Daddy! Can I have this? Pleeeease?”\n\n\n You’re amazing, Daddy, so you want to give your beloved daughter with a hundred sheets of paper as a present, with fanfare. I stare into his eyes as I layer on the extortion, but he wavers a little and retreats a step.\n\n\n “……One page would make an entire month’s wages disappear, so giving it to a kid…”\n\n\n What did you say?! An entire month’s wages?! Wh… how much could parchment cost?! This… even though I’m not a child, this is not the kind of thing that you should dangle just out of my reach!\n\n\n The reason why there’s no paper in the house, the reason why there’s no bookstores in this town, they’re all the same. The price just isn’t one that us commoners can afford to pay. No matter how much I beg for paper, my family barely makes enough money to keep us fed. Nobody’s going to buy me paper.\n\n\n I drop my shoulders, a defeated look on my face. Otto pats me gently on the head, trying to cheer me up.\n\n\n “Paper’s not the kind of thing you can find in stores that commoners can enter, anyway. It’s the kind of thing that’s only used by the nobility and the people they work with, like important merchants and government officials, so it’s not something that kids can use anyway. If you want to learn how to write, why not use a slate? How about I give you the one I used to use when I was just learning?”\n\n\n “Really? That would be great!”\n\n\n I immediately nod, and graciously make arrangements to get the slate. I’ve waited so long, and I really want to learn how to write too, so I’m going to figure out how to press Otto into serving as my teacher.\n\n\n “Thanks, Mr. Otto! Please, could you teach me how to write? I’m counting on you!”\n\n\n As I pressure Otto with my adorable smile, my father looks back and forth between the two of us with a pitiful expression on his face, but I’m not paying attention.\n\n\n Being able to practice writing, getting a slate to write on, these things are enough to set my heart soaring, but what I truly want, books, require paper. After all, you can’t preserve anything on a slate. A slate is something that you write on and erase many times, like a chalkboard. It’s great for practicing how to write, but you can’t use it as a book.\n\n\n It hadn’t even crossed my mind that paper might be something that just wasn’t sold to commoners. Hmm, how can I make any books if I don’t have any paper? If I can’t just acquire any paper, what should I do? What can I do?\n\n\n Can’t I just make it myself?\n\n\n Before I make any books, I’m going to need to start by making my own paper. However, making paper really isn’t all that simple. I don’t think it’s the kind of thing that I can just pass off as a kid playing around.\n\n\n Grr, the road to books is long!!"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Now then, even though I have my heart absolutely set on making books, I have yet to actually secure a source of paper. My Japanese sensibilities are telling me that I should just go to an office supply store, where they sell five hundred sheets of copy paper for two hundred yen, but in the world I live in now, just one page of parchment would make an entire month’s worth of my father’s salary disappear.\n\n\n To make that just one page, a hide has to be stripped, all of the fur shaved off, and then from the largest usable part of a single animal’s hide, sheets must be cut that are of a size that’s easy to work with. The page that I saw at my father’s workplace was about the size of an A4 sheet of paper. If I were to cut up a single page of parchment, I wouldn’t get more than about five to eight usable pages. To put it plainly, it’s so expensive that there’s no way a commoner like me could possibly buy enough to write a book.\n\n\n So, if I’m going to make a book, I need to make some paper.\n\n\n However, I know nothing about how to actually make paper other than what I’ve read in books. After all, paper has always been something that I could just go to a store and buy. I could go into any drugstore and find loose-leaf paper and notebooks with the rest of the school supplies. I lived in a world where people would just hand out little notepads on the street as promotional items. Banks gave out free calendars, and my mailbox was stuffed full of unwanted flyers that went straight into the trash.\n\n\n If I had one of those unwanted flyers now, I’d read every last word on it, and treasure every centimeter of the margin. A world where paper can be obtained so easily is such a luxurious one. Viva, Japan! If I were to be reborn someday, Japan would be nice.\n\n\n To make things worse, there aren’t any machines here for making paper! If I don’t have a machine to help me, the entire process is going to have to be done entirely through my own manual labor.\n\n\n You must be thinking that the solution to my problems is so obvious, now that I’ve been reborn in an alternate world without machines. I read a lot of books, you’re thinking, so I have a lot of knowledge that I can use, right? …Please, think about it for a little bit.\n\n\n All I ever wanted to do was read, and I thought that even using electrical appliances to do the daily chores was too much work. You think that such a worthless Japanese woman could suddenly start doing all the manual labor required to make paper by hand? On top of that, my current body is a child, with a weak constitution, who simply can’t do some things, isn’t allowed to do others, and is otherwise extremely restricted in action.\n\n\n In conclusion: there’s no way in hell.\n\n\n However, it’s too early to give up. Throughout the world’s history, businesses and governments have needed to keep records. This goes back to ancient times, but machine-made paper certainly isn’t that old. In other words, I might be able to take the ancient methods used in ancient times and reproduce them here and now.\n\n\n Hmmm, what did they do before they had machines?\n\n\n I scrunch up my eyebrows and open my tiny five-year-old’s hands (more like three-year-old’s because of my tiny physique) as far as they can go, concentrating hard.\n\n\n Ancient civilizations, ancient civilizations… If you’re talking about ancient civilizations, Ancient Egypt is first on the list! And, if you’re talking about Ancient Egypt, you have to talk about papyrus! Three cheers for Ancient Egypt!\n\n\n Thanks to that word-association game, I’ve hit upon the idea of making Papyrus like the Ancient Egyptians did. If it’s something they invented in ancient history, I should be able to do it myself, somehow, even with my tiny hands.\n\n\n I think that they made it out of some kind of plant, like a straight tree or tall grass… probably. Here, there are plenty of plants. I’m positive that I could find plants suitable for making paper scattered around the forest.\n\n\n Yeah, the forest. Let’s go to the forest.\n\n\n Whenever it came to books, I’d always happily do whatever impossible legwork I needed to do. My family, and even little Shu always looked on with wonder, then sighed in lament. So, now that I’ve got this idea, I want to implement it immediately. I try begging Tory to take me with her to the forest.\n\n\n “Tory, I wanna go to the forest too! Can I go w―”\n\n\n “Eh?! You?! No way!”\n\n\n She shot me down before I even had a chance to finish talking. She reacted so fast that it was obvious she hadn’t even had to think twice. On top of that, she said “no way”, not “you shouldn’t”, which implied that there wasn’t any room for me to change her mind, which really hurt.\n\n\n “Why not?”\n\n\n “You couldn’t make it there, you know?” she says, then starts counting the reasons off on her fingers. “If you can’t make it to the gates, you absolutely can’t make it all the way to the forest. And when we go to the forest, we’re going to gather firewood, fruits, and nuts, right? You really can’t take it easy out there. Also, can you even climb a tree? And when we’re coming back, would you be able to carry a big, heavy box on your back while you walk? If we wanted to make it back before the gates closed for the day, we wouldn’t be able to take any breaks on the way back. There’s no way you can do it, see?”\n\n\n The list is a little long, but it essentially all boils down to “you’re not strong enough”.\n\n\n “Also,” she says, “it’s almost winter, so there aren’t really many things we can find in the forest right now…”\n\n\n Even if I were to make it, there isn’t really anything to harvest, she’s saying.\n\n\n This is really tough. Do I go to the forest even though there might not be anything to harvest, or do I give up on making paper? This decision is way too tough.\n\n\n Tory notices the deep look of worry on my face. “What do you want to get?” she asks, tilting her head to one side. “There’s not going to be many melia fruits left, you know.”\n\n\n Melia fruits are what I’ve been making our simple shampoo out of. We haven’t been eating the fruits Tory brings back; instead, we’ve been extracting all of the oil from them and storing it. Then, occasionally, we use it as a moisturizer for our hair.\n\n\n I’d be happy to get more melia, but the important thing here is not beauty, it’s books. I need plant fibers to use as raw materials for my pseudo-papyrus.\n\n\n “Ummm… are there any ‘plants whose fibers can be easily extracted’?”\n\n\n “Eh? What?”\n\n\n Tory has a dubious look on her face, so I repeat myself. That’s definitely the face of someone who did not understand my Japanese. I think for a moment, then try to explain it again using very easy-to-understand words.\n\n\n “…I need grass with a straight, fat stalk. I just want the stalk.”\n\n\n “Hmmm…” Tory ponders my question. Does she have some kind of idea? I watch her intently as I wait for a reply. After a little while, she shrugs her shoulders with a resigned look on her face.\n\n\n “Sure, I’ll try asking Ralph and Lutz for help.”\n\n\n “Huh?” She didn’t say she was going to do it for me, but she said she’d try?\n\n\n I don’t quite understand what she’s getting at, and I tilt my head to one side. Tory seems a little surprised by my reaction. I blink a few times, my head tilted confusedly, as if to ask her what she said just now.\n\n\n “Ralph’s family raises chickens, you know? They need a lot of feed to make it through the winter.”\n\n\n Uh, even if you say “you know,” I didn’t actually know that. Tory’s saying these things as if they’re blatantly obvious, though, so I keep my actual reaction hidden. “Oh yeah!” I say.\n\n\n “So, I’ll offer to help them gather grass, then I’ll try asking them for some stalks. The seasons where we get a lot of grass are over now, so there might not be that much, okay?”\n\n\n “That’s okay! Thanks, Tory!”\n\n\n Really, Tory, you’re an amazing older sister.\n\n\n The next day, I accompany Tory downstairs as she leaves to go to the forest, and ask Ralph and Lutz if they’ll help me. They agree to do it, and I breathe a small sigh of relief. However, there’s no way I’m going to rely solely on them.\n\n\n I’m going to go and gather some grass myself. Fortunately, grass grows around the well in the places the paving stones don’t cover. I don’t know if the stalks can be used, though.\n\n\n “Mommy, I want to go down to the well with you.”\n\n\n “Oh! Do you want to help out?”\n\n\n “Nuh-uh. Something else.” It might be kind of rude, but if I spend all my time helping out, I won’t be able to gather any grass. “I wanna gather grass.” I show her the little basket Tory made earlier.\n\n\n “Ah, do your best.”\n\n\n I may have refused to help out, but she’s still letting me accompany her down, whether it’s because she doesn’t want to get in the way of my enthusiasm or because she’s happy that I have enough strength to move around like this.\n\n\n Once again, I go down the stairs, following my mother as she carries the laundry down. This is my second trip today, so just going down the stairs made me so winded that there’s no way I can gather any grass.\n\n\n I rest next to my mother as she draws water from the well, then uses a foul-smelling, not-foamy, animal-based detergent to start scrubbing away at the laundry.\n\n\n “Ohh! If it isn’t little Maine!” calls out a woman, who I don’t recognize, in a friendly voice.\n\n\n “Good morning,” I say politely.\n\n\n “Ah, Carla!” says my mother, with a smile. “Morning. You’re up early today.”\n\n\n From my mother’s reaction, it would seem that I’m misremembering. This must be an acquaintance of Maine’s. I try to keep my lack of recognition off of my face while I dig through my memories a little.\n\n\n I really do know this person. According to my memory, this is Ralph and Lutz’s mother. She’s got a fairly strong build and, hmmmm, actually seems like a very reliable person.\n\n\n So, should I something like, “thanks for all your help”? Wait, no, no, that is absolutely not what a five-year-old would say. What does a little kid say to an older woman that she’s on really good terms with? Someone, help!\n\n\n Carla looks over at me as I’m caught up in spinning thoughts around my head, then goes to draw water from the well. She hauls the bucket up effortlessly, then starts washing her own laundry as well. Of course, she’s using the foul animal-based soap.\n\n\n “How are you doing today, Maine?” she asks. “It’s rare to see you outside.”\n\n\n “I’m picking some grass! Ralph and Lutz said that they’re gathering it for the chickens.”\n\n\n “Aww, for us? You shouldn’t have,” she says, in a tone of voice that seems to imply that it’s no big deal either way as she continues to pound away at her laundry.\n\n\n She, along with my mother, is having a lively conversation about this and that with the other mothers that have gathered around the well. Incidentally, it’s amazing how all of these mothers are talking so much while continuing to work so diligently.\n\n\n Nevertheless, this soap really stinks. If you tried using some herbs to help erase the smell, wouldn’t it be nicer? Or maybe would the two smells multiply and turn into an unbearable stench?\n\n\n Reminded of my plans for improvement, I stand up and start tearing grass from the ground. I try to look for plants with thick, straight stalks that I can use, but I can’t actually tear those out with my own strength.\n\n\n Doing this with my bare hands is impossible. Someone, get me a sickle, please…\n\n\n Of course, no sickle arrives, and there’s no way I can get any of this with just my bare hands. Well, whatever. I’m going to just rely on Tory, Ralph, and Lutz, who went to the forest to help feed the chickens.\n\n\n I’ve given up on finding grass that I can use, so I start pulling up the little sprouts or weaker leaves that the chickens might be able to eat. Even I can pull these out with no problem.\n\n\n “Maine, it’s time to go!” calls my mother, holding her tub full of tightly wrung-out clothes. It seems like she’s done with the laundry already. I’ve barely filled my little basked halfway, but my mother has to go to work today, and there’s no way I’m going to get scolded for being selfish. I pick up my basket, and start walking back home.\n\n\n “Are you all set?” she asks. “Right, let’s go.”\n\n\n “Okay!”\n\n\n When I first became Maine, I had a fever and my mother was taking time off from work to take care of me, so I didn’t know anything but how life inside my own home was like. Now that I’m healthy again, it seems that I’m going to be left in the care of my elderly neighbor, who’s agreed to babysit me.\n\n\n If she hadn’t, Tory wouldn’t be able to go to the forest. Got it.\n\n\n “Mommy’s got to go to work now, Maine. Be a good girl and keep quiet, okay?”\n\n\n “Okay!”\n\n\n “I’ll leave her to you, Gerda.”\n\n\n “Right, right,” she says. “Come, Maine.”\n\n\n Gerda’s place is full of other children, being watched over just like me. All of these kids are basically infants, who could only really escape by toddling away. In this town, when you’re about three years old, you’re strong enough to start going with your older brothers and sisters to the forest and helping out with the chores. In short, it seems like my family thinks that I’m as weak as a toddler, and can’t stay at home by myself.\n\n\n What the heck?!\n\n\n As I fume about my family’s shocking evaluation of my own worth, I see a boy pick up a toy that had fallen on the ground and move to stick it in his mouth. Next to him, a tiny little girl suddenly started crying and hitting him.\n\n\n “Whoa, gross!” I exclaim. “Don’t put that in your mouth!”\n\n\n “Oh my,” says the old lady.\n\n\n “Don’t just start hitting him,” I say to the little girl. “What’s going on?”\n\n\n “Now, now,” says the old lady.\n\n\n I’m supposed to be just another kid getting baby-sat, but as the biggest kid around I’ve started watching out for the other kids.\n\n\n “Oh my,” “now, now,” what the heck! Gerda, old lady, do your job!\n\n\n While I help Gerda put the littlest kids to sleep, I start thinking about how I’m going to turn the grass stalks I’m going to get into papyrus.\n\n\n Honestly, I don’t really remember how papyrus was made. I never actually had to know.\n\n\n Certainly, I remember seeing papyrus. It was remarkably thick, with fibers running horizontally and vertically. The fibers on the back were different from the ones on the front and only one side was writable, and there was a note to the side instructing us not to bend it… but there wasn’t anything written there about how it was made.\n\n\n Even more troubling, I can’t remember what the photo I saw of it getting made even looked like. I have a hunch about how I might make the fibers all run in the right direction, but how do I bond them together? Is it like rice paper? Do I need some kind of glue or binding agent?\n\n\n As I think back on how those historical documents neglected to mention these important details, my head tilts to one side. For now, I think I’ll try taking a part of the fibers from the hardest stems, then weaving them horizontally and vertically as tightly as I can. With this, I think I won’t need any sort of binding agent. That parchment seemed kind of cloth-like, and this is still my first time making pseudo-papyrus, so if I’ll be satisfied if I can just get a page i can write on.\n\n\n “Maine, someone’s here for you,” says Gerda.\n\n\n “Toooryyyy~!”\n\n\n It’s evening time, so Tory and the others have come back from the forest to pick me up. I’m so relieved. I was so glad to hear that someone came for me. That emotion sweeps over me, and I cling tightly to Tory.\n\n\n Old lady Gerda’s babysitting did not involve looking after anyone. If something wasn’t very dangerous, she’d just leave it be. If someone peed somewhere, she’d wipe it up with a wet cloth and do nothing else. The room reeked of filth. Since I’ve got the common knowledge of Japan stuck in my head, it’s obvious that this day-care is truly terrible. Leaving your kids with a baby-sitter like that is truly terrible.\n\n\n Really, I want to do something about it, but the problem’s too big for my tiny hands. I can’t do any of the things I’m thinking of with my own hands, and I also don’t know if Gerda’s methods are common or not around here. If I start complaining, they might think that I’m the crazy one. I really wanted to run away from that deplorable environment as fast as I could. I waited in agony, wishing that someone would hurry up and come get me.\n\n\n “What’s wrong, Maine?” asks Tory, patting me on the head. “Did you get lonely after staying there for so long?”\n\n\n “When you get a little bit stronger, you can totally start coming with us to the forest,” says Ralph. “It would be great if you could come with us in the spring!” says Lutz.\n\n\n I suddenly realize that I absolutely must get stronger. Every single one of my problems has been because I’m too weak.\n\n\n “Oh, right!” says Ralph. “Here’s the grass stalks we promised you.” He reaches into his basket and grabs a fistful of grass to show me. In an instant, my worries about the old lady Gerda are blasted out of my head. The important thing here is not old ladies, it’s books. It’s paper.\n\n\n “Oh, so much! I’m so happy! Hey, while I was down at the well, I helped get you some grass too!”\n\n\n I stand tall and proud as I deliver this information, but for some reason the three of them just pat my head. To make things worse, Lutz looks down at me with a warm smile, like he’s praising me for having tried my hardest.\n\n\n Hey, how much does everyone think that I’m a child that can’t do anything useful? …I mean, I guess I can’t actually do real work, though.\n\n\n I exchange the grass I’d collected in the little basket that Tory made for the grass that the three of them had collected for me.\n\n\n Now then, with this, it’s time to make some pseudo-papyrus."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n I had originally planned to start working on turning the grass stalks that the other kids had gathered for me into my pseudo-papyrus, but it seems like fate had other plans for me.\n\n\n “Maine,” says my mother, grabbing me by the scruff of my neck as I try to slip out the door.\n\n\n “Eep?!” I squeak, startled.\n\n\n “Where do you think you’re going? I told you, today we have to start preparing for the winter, right?”\n\n\n I was trying to go down to the well so that I could start working on extracting the plant fibers from these stalks.\n\n\n Soon, we’ll all be stuck indoors as the long winter creeps in, so we’ll have to make preparations in advance. Why, though, am I being pressed into service? I’m so weak that I’m not good for anything! According to Maine’s memories, all she ever did was catch a cold, then spend all that time uselessly wandering around. In other words, I’m completely useless. (I’m hoping I don’t actually catch a cold, though.)\n\n\n “You’ll go help your father, Maine. Come,” she says.\n\n\n “Doesn’t Daddy have work?”\n\n\n “It’s his turn to take a few days off. It wouldn’t be good if the soldiers couldn’t prepare for winter, you know?”\n\n\n …Giving employees time off to go prepare for winter is an unexpectedly reasonable thing for an employer to do. On top of that, is preparing for the winter really so hard that it requires a man’s help?\n\n\n Regardless, even if my father is home, it’s unusual for me to be paired up with him. He’s a muscle-headed soldier, after all, so it’s usually the much more fit and energetic Tory that winds up going with him.\n\n\n Since the entire family’s home, I don’t think I’ll be able to escape. And, since it seems like my father’s specifically nominated me, I’ve got no choice but to follow him.\n\n\n “…So what are we going to do?” I ask.\n\n\n Next to the kitchen window, my father is pulling out some things that look like tools.\n\n\n “We’re going to go through the house and do a little maintenance on anything that needs it. The door’s what’s going to protect us from a big snowstorm, so we need to make sure the hinges are tight, there’s no rust, and there aren’t any holes in the wood. When we’re done with that, we’re going to clean out the chimney and the flue for the stove. We don’t want to have any problems with those during the winter.”\n\n\n “Huhhh…”\n\n\n I understand what needs to be done, but how the hell am I supposed to help with any of that? I can barely hold a screwdriver, much less turn it. I can’t carry anything heavy, either! You can see these skinny little arms right?!\n\n\n However, if I’m enthusiastic about doing whatever little bit I can to help out, it’ll go a long way to helping build up my family’s confidence in me. I can definitely help identify the loose parts on the hinges, and my modern-age knowledge will make spotting rust a piece of cake.\n\n\n “Daddy, on this hinge, isn’t this nail getting rusty?” I say, pointing at a nail.\n\n\n My father bends down to study it. “…Looks like it’ll hold for now.”\n\n\n Uh, wait, no matter how you look at it, a worn-out nail like this is going to rust away, right?\n\n\n I’m immediately worried by how confidently my father said that. Once winter hits, this door’s our main defense against a snowstorm, so it breaking down halfway through would be very bad for us. I climb up on a chair so I can reach the door, and try to rattle it back and forth. No matter how confident my father may be, if I’m able to break it like this, then surely he’d recognize my superior judgement.\n\n\n After I wiggle the door a few times, the top hinge pops off with a sharp ping, and the door starts to precariously sway on its one remaining hinge. I nod in satisfaction, but my father’s face goes ghastly white as he sees the door wobble.\n\n\n “M- Maine?!”\n\n\n “Looook, it broke!” I say, pointing at the door. “It wasn’t going to last the winter. Make sure you fix it, Daddy!”\n\n\n My father, pretending to ignore his judgement error, helps me down off the chair. “Maybe you should go help your mother now.”\n\n\n Perhaps he’s upset that his daughter pointed out his mistake? I shrug my shoulders, shaking my head. It can’t be helped, I’m not going anywhere. My mother specifically assigned me to help my father, so I’m going to stay next to him and continue my inspections. I’m going to make sure that we make it safely and comfortably through the winter.\n\n\n “Huh?” I say. “I’ve got to make sure you’ve found everything! We’re fixing things so they don’t break in the winter, so we shouldn’t leave things all beat up like that.”\n\n\n “We can’t afford to fix everything, and I can’t have you around breaking everything you can. Go see your mother.”\n\n\n …Money problems, again!\n\n\n I thought I’d be able to make my father take things a little more seriously by breaking the hinge. Instead, I’m having to quietly make my way to the bedroom to go help Tory and my mother.\n\n\n The two of them are hanging shirts and blankets from clotheslines, as if they were trying to dry them, and rearranging the beds to be closer to the kitchen stove, trying to make the place just a little bit warmer.\n\n\n “What’s wrong, Maine?”\n\n\n “Daddy said that I should come help you instead, Mommy.”\n\n\n “Oh? Well, we’re almost done with this, so next we’re going to work on getting some more light in here. We should have some beeswax this year. We’ve also got some tallow and some tree nuts, so we’ll spend some time squeezing some oil for the lamp and making a few candles.”\n\n\n Just hearing about the work makes me wrinkle my nose. I’ve been smelling the stench of animal fats coming from various other houses lately, but the thought of filling our own kitchen with that stink makes me feel really uneasy.\n\n\n Tory heads off to the storage room to start pressing oil out of the nuts. I, however, don’t have enough strength to swing a hammer, so I can’t seek shelter in the storage room with her.\n\n\n Next to my mother, our largest saucepan sits over the fire, filled with nothing but beef tallow.\n\n\n It stinks!! Hang in there, me…\n\n\n I might be able to bear this stench for now, but it looks like the total extent of my mother’s preparation is only just melting the tallow alone and skimming off the impurities that rise to the top.\n\n\n “Wait, Mommy, is that really all you’re doing? You’re not going to ‘salt it out’?”\n\n\n “Hmm? What was that?”\n\n\n Oh, crap. “Salting out” is so extremely obvious, but it looks like she doesn’t know about it.\n\n\n I try not to flinch as my mother’s stare drills into me, as if she’s asking me if I really have a problem. As best as I can, I try to explain the process using only simple words.\n\n\n “It’s, um… where you add salt water, then you cook it over the fire a little more, and then you strain out the dirt multiple times?”\n\n\n “Salt water?” she asks.\n\n\n “Yeah. When you leave it alone and it cools down, only the fat on top will harden, and the water on the bottom will stay liquid, you know? Then, you can take out the water, and only use the fat that was on top. It’s more work, but it will smell a lot better, and it’ll be a higher quality fat, too.”\n\n\n I don’t know if it’s because I said “higher quality” or not, but my mother starts salting out the tallow. The quality of the candles that we’re going to be burning throughout the entire winter is literally a life-or-death matter for me. We’re going to be trapped indoors with it, after all. Living in a house filled with that kind of stench for the whole winter would be far too much for me to bear.\n\n\n I don’t actually know the right concentration of salt we should be using, but even just a little should make things better, right?\n\n\n I guessed on the concentration, but as we salted out the tallow, it gradually started turning from a dirty yellow to a pure white. We’ll be able to use this to make candles, and then when spring comes around and we need to make soap, we can melt the candles again and re-use the tallow.\n\n\n Not one to waste anything, my mother uses the chunks of meat and bone that we filtered out of the tallow to make a delicious soup stock, which we have for lunch. After that, we start making the candles.\n\n\n “Now then,” says my mother. “Tory, please work on the candles. Your father and I will go and start working on the firewood.”\n\n\n “Okaay!” says Tory, cheerfully.\n\n\n …Uh, what am I supposed to do, then?\n\n\n The three of them stand up and get to work. I think about it for a little while, then decide to follow along behind my mother, who’s about to step out the front door. I guess I’m going to continue trying to help her out. She notices me, however, and points firmly back towards the kitchen table.\n\n\n “Maine, go help Tory with the candles. Try not to get in the way.”\n\n\n “…Fine.”\n\n\n Why do you have so little trust in me?\n\n\n I turn back to the kitchen, where Tory is cutting string into lots of equal lengths to use as wicks. She ties them to wooden sticks, letting them dangle. She takes each stick and starts to dip the strings into and out of the pot of tallow, one by one. As she dips them over and over, tallow starts to soak into and harden around each string, gradually building in circumference with each repetition. Slowly, candles start to take shape.\n\n\n “Huh, so is that how you make candles…” I muse.\n\n\n “Maine, don’t just watch, help me!” says Tory, scowling.\n\n\n Tory’s starting to get mad, so I decide to help out. I chop up some herbs to erase the scent, then take some candles from the pile so that I can start rolling them in the herbs. They’ll have some effect when they’re stuck to the outside of the candle, but next year, I’m going to make sure that these herbs get mixed in to the tallow as it melts.\n\n\n “Maine! Don’t play around!” says Tory.\n\n\n “…I’m only going to use these ones. It’s better to have candles that aren’t smelly, right? Please, Tory!”\n\n\n “Okay, fine, but only those ones!”\n\n\n I nod vigorously to show that Tory’s made herself clear.\n\n\n I don’t know if this will work or not, so I wasn’t planning on doing this to every candle anyway. I get the herbs attached to five of the candles, varying the amount and positioning so that I can try to figure out what will produce the best result.\n\n\n While Tory and I keep working like that on the candles, our parents work on preparing enough firewood. There’s so much careful preparation that goes into preparing for the winter, but it’s necessary if we don’t want to freeze to death. To supplement the kindling that Tory brought back, my father’s brought back a huge number of logs, each half a meter long, that he went out and purchased. He’s currently splitting them into firewood, his hatchet beating out a steady rhythm as he works. My mother collects the wood as it splits apart, then carries it to another room to stack it up for later.\n\n\n “Mommy, where are you taking that?” I ask, startled, as she opens a door to a room I’d never seen before. This is the first time I’ve noticed it, but attached to the storage room is what seems to be an additional storage room. It looks like it might not be used for anything but storing materials that were prepared for the winter. Already, the room is half-filled with chopped wood.\n\n\n “Huh?” I ask, following her in. “What’s this room for?”\n\n\n “It’s… the winter storage room, you know?” she says. “Maine, why are you asking about this now?”\n\n\n Come to think of it, I had been wondering where the heck all of the firewood that Tory had brought back was being stored, but it looks like it’s being kept in here. We typically keep the firewood we use on a day-to-day basis in the storage room, so I guess I just never noticed the other room.\n\n\n “…It’s cold.”\n\n\n “Well, this is the farthest place in the house from the stove, after all.”\n\n\n Our house doesn’t have a dedicated living room with a beautiful fireplace, so the kitchen stove is the only real source of heat in the entire house. We spend most of every day in the kitchen, as a result.\n\n\n Also, since the bedroom is separated from the kitchen (and the stove) by a wall, we’ve pushed all of the beds in the room up against the closest wall. While the stove burns, the heat radiates through the wall, so when it’s time for the children to go to bed the beds are quite warm. They’re only warm right when we go to bed, however. Our mother quenches the fire before she goes to bed, so the room is piercingly cold by the time we wake up.\n\n\n This winter storage room, however, is the furthest room away from the stove, so it’s very cold in here. During the winter, this room looks like it would be great for storing food, preserves, and maybe even oil for a while, kind of like a natural refrigerator.\n\n\n “Wow, we have a lot of wood,” I say, amazed.\n\n\n “We might just barely have enough, don’t you think?”\n\n\n Even though the room’s half-full?!\n\n\n Looking at the pile of firewood before me, I suddenly start thinking about the problem of deforestation. If a single house burns this much firewood over the course of the winter, how much wood does this entire city go through in a single year?\n\n\n “Maine, don’t space out,” says my mother. “Make sure you’re ready for your handiwork.”\n\n\n I’m not spacing out!! Deforestation is a serious problem that merits significant thought!\n\n\n Even as I try to object, my mother’s already heading back out towards the kitchen. I hurry after her. I really don’t want to be in that gloomy, window-less room by myself.\n\n\n “Mommy, what’s handiwork?”\n\n\n “Hmm… well, the men might do things like repairing the tools they use for their jobs, or maybe use the time to make furniture. We need to make sure we have enough materials ready for that.”\n\n\n “Oh, it’s the jobs we do during the winter?”\n\n\n As I’m asking my questions, my mother is counting out how many balls of yarn she has. “That’s right. As for women, making clothes is our most important job, you know? If we don’t spin enough thread for weaving cloth or sewing, and if we don’t dye things in advance, we won’t be able to make anything. My job is dyeing thread, so I already have enough of that for now, but I’ll need to spend some time preparing some plants, like nilen, to spin into more thread next year.”\n\n\n “Ohh…”\n\n\n “On top of that, your sister’s baptism is next summer! We’re going to need brand new clothing for that, since it’s a special day… Hm, and I’m going to need to make that this winter, while I have time…”\n\n\n My mother’s face goes fierce as she concentrates, calculating whether or not she’ll have enough materials for the task. I don’t want to interrupt her at all, so I quietly migrate downstairs to the well, where Tory is working.\n\n\n “Tory, what are you doing for your handiwork?”\n\n\n “I’m making baskets! I’ll sell them in the spring.”\n\n\n Tory’s already started preparing the materials she’ll need for her work. She’s brought down a bundle of sticks that she’d gathered in the forest, soaked them, and peeled the bark off. Now, it looks like she’s using a knife to shave them down, parallel to the grain.\n\n\n “Maine, what will you do?” she asks.\n\n\n “Me? I’m going to make some 'pseudo-papyrus’.”\n\n\n “What’s that?”\n\n\n “Eheheh, it’s a seeeecret!”\n\n\n Following Tory’s example in getting a head start on my winter’s work, I’ll start separating the fibers I’ll need to make my pseudo-papyrus. This is an extremely important part of my preparation! This is a necessary task that nobody could possibly get mad at me about.\n\n\n To extract the fibers, I can probably do something similar to what Tory’s doing. I’ll strip the skin off of the grass stalks, soak them in water, and then dry them. Since there’s not very much time left to finish our preparations, I wasn’t able to get a whole lot of grass. Now, though, I can finally start working on separating out these plant fibers.\n\n\n “Hey, Tory,” I say, “can I get some water?”\n\n\n “…Sure.”\n\n\n “Hey, Tory,” I say, “how do you think I should take just the fibers out of this?”\n\n\n “Huh? Ummmm…”\n\n\n “Hey, Tory,” I say, “these won’t fly away if I dry them like this, right?”\n\n\n “……”\n\n\n I bundle up the plant fibers that I’ve managed to extract. There aren’t a whole lot of them, but for the purposes of my experiments I should be able to make maybe one or two pages with this amount.\n\n\n And, so, I conclude my final preparations for the coming winter. Whoof, man, I worked hard!\n\n\n Huh? Why’s Tory looking so exasperated?"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The most important part of preparing for the winter is stockpiling food. Unlike Japan, there aren’t any supermarkets around here that stay open all year round. The winter weather closes down the town markets, and there aren’t very many vegetables that can really be gathered outside. So, if you don’t want to starve to death, procuring enough food in advance is indispensable.\n\n\n And, so, here I am, sitting in a beat-up second-hand wagon amidst a huge pile of boxes. I was rudely awakened this morning, in pitch-blackness, long before the dawn had even begun to break.\n\n\n “Now, then,” my father cheerfully boomed, “today we’re going to the farming village! Is everyone ready?”\n\n\n There’s no excuse for doing that.\n\n\n I rubbed the sleep from my eyes, wondering what on Earth he’s talking about. I scowled at him, but both my mother and Tory are beaming happily. What do I do? All I can do is follow along with the conversation.\n\n\n “Come to think of it, Maine,” said my mother, clapping her hands together, “you were out sick while we were talking about this earlier, so you might not have heard.”\n\n\n My father and Tory nodded in consent. Once again, I’d been left out of a family discussion. I wasn’t the slightest bit amused. I tried to glare sullenly at them, but they’d already started quickly moving around as they got ready to leave.\n\n\n “Anyhow, make sure you dress very warmly, Maine!” she said as she gathered boxes. “You got really sick last year!”\n\n\n There’s no way they were going to leave me to take care of myself all day, so I had no choice but to quietly follow along as she clattered her way downstairs.\n\n\n …Nevertheless, why are we going to a farming village, anyway?\n\n\n I had hoped to walk on my own power in order to work on building up some more strength, but my father, frustrated by how slow I was, picked me up and put me in the cart. Now, I’m riding amidst a variety of barrels, empty bottles, piles of cloth, bundles of cord, bags of salt, and all of the other things it seems like we need in order to go visit a farming village.\n\n\n …Hmm? Perhaps, since I’m in this cart, I’m the most useless piece of luggage on this trip?\n\n\n I don’t have a whole lot of space up here, so I make myself as small as I can and settle down. Up front, my father is yoked to the cart, pulling it forward while my mother and Tory push it from behind. It’s becoming really obvious that I’m just extra weight on this trip, which is a little bit depressing.\n\n\n “Hey, Mommy,” I say, “Why’re we going to a village?”\n\n\n “There’s not many places where we can go in the city to smoke our meat, you know?” she says. “So, we’re going to the nearest village and borrowing one of their smoke huts.”\n\n\n “Smoking meat? Oh yeah, we did go buy a lot of meat the other day.”\n\n\n We already salted it, brined it, and did all sorts of other things to preserve that meat, but there’s still more stuff to do? Is this process maybe a little too painful? Is the meat still okay?\n\n\n As I count off the days since we bought the meat on my fingers, I grow more and more anxious. My mother looks over at me, shocked.\n\n\n “What are you talking about? Today’s pig-slaughtering day, you know. We’re going to buy two pigs, then help everyone out to spread out the work, and then we’ll all share the results.”\n\n\n “Uh?”\n\n\n My ears instantly reject my mother’s words. In the fraction of a second it takes the sounds to reach my brain, a chill starts running down my spine.\n\n\n “P… P-p-p… pig-slaughtering day?!”\n\n\n “It’s a day where we go meet up with our neighbors, slaughter and butcher a few pigs, salt and smoke the meat, and make things like bacon, pot roasts, and sausage. Maine… oh, right, last year you stayed in the cart because you were so feverish.”\n\n\n If at all possible, I would like to get a fever this year too. If I can do that, then at the very least I might be able to shield my eyes from that grim display.\n\n\n “Mommy, didn’t we buy a ton of meat at the market the other day…?”\n\n\n “There’s no way that much meat would last the entire winter, you know? We bought that to supplement the meat we’re going to get from slaughtering pigs today, since you know that won’t be enough by itself either, right?”\n\n\n I thought we had bought a huge amount of meat, but I hadn’t even considered the possibility that what we bought was just to supplement our stocks. I have no idea whatsoever as to how much meat is truly required when preparing for the winter.\n\n\n It looks like can’t save myself from being dragged to pig-slaughtering day, so a wave of depression sweeps through my heart. In contrast, Tory is wearing her biggest smile while she pushes the cart onward.\n\n\n “This is going to be fun!” she says. “We’re going to get to help out, and then we’ll get to eat freshly-made sausage. This is your first time helping, but when you get caught up in the noise and excitement everyone’s making, it feels kinda like a mini festival! I’m excited that you’re helping out this year!”\n\n\n “‘Everyone’?” I ask, tilting my head to the side in confusion.\n\n\n My mother shoots me a look, as if asking me why I’m asking such obvious questions. “The rest of the neighbors, right? Slaughtering a pig is a big task, so it’s not really easy to do it with less than ten adults, you know?”\n\n\n Whoa, the neighbors, huh…\n\n\n There’s a lot of spots in Maine’s memories that are really fuzzy, so there’s no doubt that there will be a lot of people there who will know me even though I have no idea who they are. Far more troublesome, however, is what we’ve come to do today: slaughtering and butchering a pig. Just remembering the grisly spectacle at the market the other day sends chills down my spine.\n\n\n “…I don’t wanna go,” I say.\n\n\n “What are you saying?” asks my mother. “If we don’t go, we’re not going to have any sausage or bacon for the winter, you know?”\n\n\n It seems like I’m not allowed to complain, since we don’t have enough food for the winter otherwise. If we don’t go, we’ll starve, so no matter how much I complain, I’ll still be forced to cooperate.\n\n\n As my mood grows gloomier and gloomier, our cart reaches the southern gate of the city walls.\n\n\n “Good morning,” says a soldier, one of my father’s subordinates, standing guard at the gate. “Oh? Sir, are you running late? Everyone else already left the gates a long time ago.”\n\n\n “Yeah, I know…”\n\n\n Somehow, it seems like our neighbors have are already long gone.\n\n\n “Have a good day, sir.”\n\n\n The young-looking guard smiles and waves at me as we go past, and I make myself wave back. Being friendly is important.\n\n\n This is my first time leaving the city since becoming Maine, so when the cart rumbles out of the short tunnel the gate is set into, I let out an astonished gasp. To be honest, I hadn’t even thought that the environments inside and outside the city walls could be so different.\n\n\n “Whoa…”\n\n\n First of all, there aren’t any houses. The streets within the city are always so crowded and claustrophobic, but this road widens into a broad highway as it leaves the gates. Off in the distance, I can see a village, with about ten to fifteen buildings that just look like dots on the horizon.\n\n\n Also, the air is fantastic. As we leave, the accumulated stench of human filth dissipates into nothingness, leaving only sweet, clean air in its place. There are no walls here to trap in foul air.\n\n\n Everywhere I look is green, from the light green of the rolling fields before me to the deep green of the tall, tall trees of the forest in the distance. Everything is extraordinarily tranquil.\n\n\n “Maine, close your mouth before you bite off your tongue,” warns my father.\n\n\n “Eh?!”\n\n\n Immediately after my father gives his warning, the cart lurches hard to the side, then starts to bounce and jostle even worse than it was doing so before. We’ve left the cobblestone roads of the city behind us, and the road ahead is packed, unpaved dirt. The luggage shakes around as if it might pop out of the cart, but, luckily, the ropes tied around it keep it in place. I, however, have no such security.\n\n\n On a sunny day, you’d have to clatter over hard, uneven packed clay. On a rainy day, you’d have to slog through mushy, soggy mud. These roads are the worst! Pour some asphalt!\n\n\n Unable to escape through my tightly-closed mouth, my objections bounce around in my head wildly. I cling, desperately, to the side of the cart, trying my hardest not to fall out.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “We’re almost there,” says my father.\n\n\n Fifteen minutes after we left the city gates, we’ve arrived at the entrance to the farming village. The village is bustling, with countless people moving about.\n\n\n Butchering pigs is primarily a man’s work. Holding down a hundred-kilogram pig, trussing it up, and hoisting it all requires a good deal of strength. Meanwhile, the women handle setting up the smoking huts, getting huge amounts of water ready for boiling, making sure all of the tools and salt are ready, and doing other general prep work.\n\n\n It looks like the slaughter had actually started just before we finally arrived. Of course, if you’re not there to help, you don’t get any meat.\n\n\n “Oh no,” exclaims my father, “they’ve already started!”\n\n\n “That’s not good!” says my mother. “Tory, hurry!”\n\n\n “Yeah!”\n\n\n The three of them let go of the cart, then pull out aprons made from some sort of thick, heavy material that looks like it’s been heavily covered with wax. My mother and Tory run towards the smoking huts, where quite a few women have already gathered, putting on their aprons as they ran. My father ties his apron on securely, grabs the spear he uses for work out of the back of the wagon, then dashes towards the town square.\n\n\n That was fast!!\n\n\n In the blink of an eye, my family abandoned me before I had any time to react. I might still be able to run after my mother, but I have no idea what I’d be supposed to do in such a huge crowd, so it’s only natural that I’m apprehensive about that idea. Since this is a yearly event, it looks like everyone already knows what they need to do from common knowledge. Give me the instruction manual, please…\n\n\n Since I’d just get in the way if I tried to help, I’ll stay here and watch over the cart until someone calls for me. I sit down amongst the rest of the abandoned luggage, staring off into space, convincing myself that what I’m doing is an important task.\n\n\n However, the spot where my father chose to leave his luggage is in full view of the village square, where they’re doing the slaughtering. There’s a little bit of distance between me and the square, but I can clearly hear the agonized squeals of one of the pigs and plainly see as it frantically tries to escape.\n\n\n A rope has been tied to a wooden stake set firmly in the ground. The other end of the rope has already been tied around the pig’s right hindleg. The men chase it around and around the stake, desperately trying to catch and hold it down. I see a flash of familiar pink hair amongst the crowd; Ralph and Lutz are undoubtedly in there.\n\n\n “Here I come!” yells my father, charging onto the battlefield with spear at the ready. He sets his spear, then with a mighty shout, pierces into the pig with a single, strong thrust. The pig collapses to the ground from that one strike, convulsing in its death throes before finally falling still.\n\n\n I squeak in horror as all the blood drains from my face, but the people in the plaza start cheering for my father. My mother runs out, carrying a metal container, kind of like a bucket, on a somewhat lengthy wooden pole. Another woman follows, bringing with her some kind of large bowl.\n\n\n I have no idea what they’re about to do, so I lean forward to get a better look. In the next instant, blood suddenly flies out, and some people’s aprons are stained bright, dripping red. Preparations for catching the blood had just been finished, it seems, so my father had yanked out the spear and caused blood to start spurting from the wound. Reflexively, I clamp my hand over my mouth and fall back into the wagon.\n\n\n The pig is concealed from view behind the skirt of the woman with the bowl, but I can see how she collects the massive amounts of blood in her bowl, transferring it to the bucket whenever it gets full. This seems to be her everyday job, from the way she moves. My mother, on the other hand, has her brow deeply furrowed as she puts all of her strength behind churning the blood as it’s poured into the bucket.\n\n\n …My mother’s pretty scary.\n\n\n Then, the pig was brought over to a specially prepared tree and strung up, upside down, from a sturdy branch. All of the blood that hadn’t been completely drained from the body starts to drip down.\n\n\n Now, it’s time for the real butchering to begin. A man steps forward, wielding a thick, heavy butcher’s knife, and vertically slits the pig’s belly open.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n That’s about all I can remember. When I wake up, I’m no longer in the village, but instead in some room made of stone. Judging by what I can see of the ceiling from where I’m laying, this isn’t my house. I blink my eyes to clear them, then I suddenly recall what I was watching just before I fainted. I feel terrible, suddenly.\n\n\n It’s strange, though. I can’t shake the feeling that I’d seen something like this before.\n\n\n What would it have been? Something where something got hung up, then carved apart…\n\n\n It feels like it’s on the tip of my tongue, but I can’t quite make the connection. I don’t think this is one of Maine’s memories, I think this is one of mine. I think I saw something similar to this in Japan…\n\n\n Oh, got it! I was at a fish market near the harbor in Ibaraki, and I watched them hang up an enormous goosefish and slice it apart! I remember it clearly now.\n\n\n Now that I think about it, there are some similarities between slaughtering a pig and the live fish cleaning show. There are some things that really can only be eaten when they’re really fresh, and I can understand how everyone seemed to find it such a fun sight to see.2\n\n\n Well, I can understand it in theory, but I don’t personally find it all that fun. For one thing, a tuna fish don’t scream sorrowfully when you kill them, and the blood doesn’t drip thickly out of it. Urgh, I really don’t feel well…\n\n\n I cover my mouth and roll over on my side, which causes me to fall off of whatever I was sleeping on with a thud.\n\n\n “Oww…”\n\n\n I push myself up with my arms to get a better view of my surroundings. It seems like I had been laid down on a smallish wooden bench. There’s a fireplace nearby, with a fire crackling inside, so I don’t feel cold at all. I don’t, however, see anyone nearby, nor do I hear any voices.\n\n\n …So, where am I?\n\n\n As I try to figure out where exactly as I am, a soldier peers into the room, drawn by the thud I made when I fell down.\n\n\n “Oh! You’re awake,” he says.\n\n\n “Mister Otto?”\n\n\n I sigh in relief, seeing a familiar face. If Otto is here in this stone building, then this must be either one of the waiting rooms or the night duty room at the city gates. Now that I know where I am, my anxiety gradually starts to dissipate.\n\n\n “Ah, you remember me, then?” he says, relief showing plainly on his face. Since I look like a little girl, I’m sure he was worried that I’d start crying if I woke up and saw someone I didn’t know, and then he wouldn’t know what to do.\n\n\n “I didn’t forget!” This man, after all, is one of the precious few cultured people in this world, and the man who is going to (hopefully) teach me how to read and write.\n\n\n I give my best imitation salute, tapping my chest with my fist. Otto smiles wryly, ruffles my hair in response, and starts to explain my present situation.\n\n\n “The corporal brought you here a little while ago, looking really embarrassed. Apparently, you collapsed in your wagon. He said he’ll come by to pick you up as soon as he’s done with what he needs to do in the village.”\n\n\n I don’t know how long it takes to butcher a pig, but even after it’s butchered there’s a lot of processing work that needs to be done, so I don’t think it’s the kind of thing that’s going to be over quickly.\n\n\n …Now that I think about, Tory said that there was going to be dinner made with really fresh meat, didn’t she?\n\n\n It seems like I might be waiting here for quite some time. I’d brought the materials for my fake papyrus with me in the cart, since I didn’t know if I was going to be waiting around for a while in the village. Unfortunately, I don’t have any of it with me now.\n\n\n “What’s wrong, Maine?” asks Otto, “Are you lonely because your mom and dad aren’t here?”\n\n\n “…No,” I say, shaking my head. “I’m just wondering what I should do while I wait?”\n\n\n I accidentally let slip my true motives. Otto stares at me for a little bit, then mutters something about remembering that I look a couple years younger than I really am.\n\n\n “I’ve got just the thing, Maine,” he says, retrieving something from nearby. “How about we kill some time with this?”\n\n\n “Whoa! A slate!”\n\n\n Otto hands me the slate. He must have known that I’d definitely come through the gates today, so he would have brought it with him to give to me. He’s cultured, he’s considerate, he’s kind, he’s too amazing!!\n\n\n “I have to stand guard at the gate today,” he says, writing Maine’s name at the top of the slate, “so how about you practice with this?”\n\n\n He hands me a slate pencil and a cloth, then leaves the room. I see him off with a huge wave and a brilliant smile, clutching the slate tightly to my chest. As he closes the door behind him, I look down at the slate.\n\n\n It’s probably best to describe it as a kind of mini-blackboard, about the size of an A4 sheet of paper. It’s a thin plate of dark stone, surrounded by a simple wooden frame. Both the back and the front can be written on, and on one side, thin lines have been painted to help you practice writing straight.\n\n\n The slate pencil is a tool for writing on the slate. It’s cool to the touch, hard, and seems to be made out of some kind of stone, but it looks to me like a long, slender piece of chalk. This slightly dirty cloth seems to be what I’ll use instead of an eraser.\n\n\n The letters Otto wrote at the top of the slate have gotten a little smudged, after I held the slate against my shirt a little while ago.\n\n\n “Whoa, my heart’s racing!”\n\n\n I set the slate on top of the desk, and pick up the chalk. As soon as I grip it like I would a pencil, my heart starts pounding in my ears.\n\n\n First, I try copying the completely unfamiliar letters that Otto wrote at the top for me. The mental strain of writing these new characters for the first time is almost too much, and my writing is wobbly and distorted. If this were Japan, the teacher would tut at me and have me start over. However, stopping now to erase the board would be a waste of time, and I’m far too happy right now to finally see letters again.\n\n\n I force myself to take deep, slow breaths, then use the cloth to gently wipe off the left side of the board. I carefully write out another line, and this time it’s much better than before.\n\n\n I write my name, and erase it, and write it, and erase it… When I get tired of that, I switch to writing all of the haiku and tanka poetry I can remember in Japanese, and erase it, and write it, and erase it…\n\n\n Ahhh, this is bliss. Reading and writing is such a joyous thing.\n\n\n There may have been a fire going, but a cold draft still crept its way in. As I waited for however many hours it took for my family to come pick me up, playing with the slate for the entire time, my weak constitution caused me to catch a cold embarrassingly quickly, and my fever came back.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Your temperature still hasn’t gone down, so stay in bed,” admonishes Tory. “Don’t get up again!”\n\n\n “…Fine.”\n\n\n My parents are rushing in and out of the house, carrying in loads of vegetables and cramming them into the winter preparation room. In the kitchen, Tory has been boiling down the fruits that she collected from the forest and making jam. For the first time since coming to this world, I’m smelling sweet things, and the way it permeates the house makes me a little bit happier.\n\n\n In the midst of stocking up on alcohol and bringing in pig meat, Tory had come in to bring me some soup for lunch. I had put my slate to the side, and taken the tray from her.\n\n\n “I’m sorry, Tory,” I say.\n\n\n “I mean it!”\n\n\n “Oh? Do you promise not to tell on me?”\n\n\n “I don’t make promises like that!”\n\n\n That is, she doesn’t make promises. What even is a promise, anyway?\n\n\n While the family clatters about, finalizing the preparations for the coming winter, I’m stuck lazing about in my bed, scribbling on the slate that Otto gave me. I practice writing my name, writing whatever sentences in Japanese that come to mind, and so on.\n\n\n I really do want a book that I can record things in permanently. If I’m this happy from just being able to write, I’ll be even happier if I’m able to read book!\n\n\n I have to get better soon, so that I can work on making my paper."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n About when I wasn’t sure whether we were done or not with our preparations, winter flitted into the streets, and real, honest snow began to fall. During the winter, the entire neighborhood is locked in by the snow, so we’re typically confined in our houses except on unusually clear days.\n\n\n For me, if I have books to read, I can let myself be shut away forever, so whiling away the long winter months would be no trouble at all. I, however, don’t have a single book. Will I be able to manage this long kind of isolation without them?\n\n\n As the snow kept falling, it frequently turned into a full-blown snowstorm, forcing us to keep the doors and shutters tightly closed, with thick clothes stuffed into the crevices to try to shield us from the drafts just a little more.\n\n\n “…Uuuugh, it’s dark,” I whine.\n\n\n “We’re in a snowstorm,” says Tory, ”there’s nothing we can do about that.”\n\n\n The only sources of light in this locked-down apartment are a handful of candles and our stove. It may be daytime, but with our windows sealed so tightly not a single ray of sunlight can get in. This is my first time being in such a gloomy room without a single electric light to brighten it. Even when a hurricane knocked out my power, I had flashlights and the light on my cell phone for illumination, and they got my power restored very quickly. Trapped inside a gloomy room such as this, will I have no choice but to become gloomy myself?\n\n\n “Hey, Mommy, is everyone’s house dark like this?” I ask.\n\n\n “Hmm,” she says, “If someone has a little money, they can have quite a few lamps lighting up their homes. We only have one, though.”\n\n\n “Oh? Let’s light ours, then!”\n\n\n My mother sighs and shakes her head at me as I try to insist that lighting equipment is meant to be used. “We want to be careful with our oil, so we should avoid using it whenever we can. If it stays this cold and if the winter drags on, we’ll run out of candles eventually, and that would be a big problem, you know?”\n\n\n There’s no counterargument to the way she talks about frugality. Come to think of it, my own mother in Japan was always talking about scrimping and saving and coming up with elaborate ways to spend as little as possible. To save electricity, she’d unplug the TV when it wasn’t in use, although she’d then fall asleep with it on all the time. She’d brush her teeth the barest minimum of water to save on the water bill, yet she’d leave the faucet running constantly while washing the dishes… I wonder what she would do to lighten up this room, if she were in this situation.\n\n\n “Maine, what are you doing?” asks my mother.\n\n\n “I wonder if this will make the room just a little bit brighter…”\n\n\n I’ve grabbed one of my father’s old metal gauntlets from his old wartime days, polished them up a bit, and placed it next to a candle, trying to use its metal surface like a mirror to maybe make it seem a little brighter.\n\n\n “Maine, stop that,” says my father.\n\n\n “I can’t see what I’m doing,” says Tory.\n\n\n Two people rejected me at the same time! Unfortunately, these gauntlets aren’t straight pieces of metal, and you can’t really say that they’re anywhere close to being shiny. They caught the flickering candlelight with a strange, irregular reflection, glimmering harshly in our eyes and making it even more difficult to see what we were doing.\n\n\n “Ahh, it didn’t work… I wonder if there’s anything else I can use as a ”mirror”…”\n\n\n “Please don’t do unnecessary things,” says my mother.\n\n\n After being quite clearly asked to stop, I give up on my plans to brighten the room using reflections. It’s not like I’m trying to read right now, but I still sigh, lamenting the poor visibility, and go huddle by the warmth of the stove.\n\n\n Soon after, my mother starts assembling a loom for weaving fabric. This isn’t like one of the enormous, mechanical weaver’s looms I saw back in Japan. This is much more primitive. I had been wondering how she was planning on weaving cloth in this tiny room, but it looks like we do have something that’s just the right size.\n\n\n “Tory, your baptism is coming up, so make sure you pay attention to this,” says my mother as she carefully instructs Tory on how to work the loom. Tory, with a serious expression on her face, picks up a spool of thread.\n\n\n “First, put the spool of thread here, then we prepare the warp. Run the thread straight through, like this…”\n\n\n Making clothing starts by first weaving cloth out of the thread that our mother dyed during the autumn. You weave the cloth, then you sew the clothing, then you embroider it. Next year, we’re going to spin the thread too out of wool that we’ll buy during the spring. The only thing that we actually purchased in this entire process was the raw materials. It doesn’t look like you can just buy new clothing at a store, and fabric doesn’t seem to be the kind of thing that commoners can afford.\n\n\n “That’s right, just like that. You’re a fast learner, Tory! Maine, do you want to try? If you don’t learn how to sew, you’ll never be called beautiful, you know?”\n\n\n “Huh? Beautiful?”\n\n\n “That’s right! When it comes to making clothing for your family, it’s important that they either look good to others or are very practical, you know? If you want to be beautiful, you need to know how to cook and sew.”\n\n\n Ahhh, then I shall never be beautiful. …Wait, those conditions sound about right for being a good wife, but they’ve got nothing to do with being beautiful, right?\n\n\n In my mind, clothing is something you buy in a store. When you go to the mall, each shop is overflowing with clothing of all sorts of styles and all sorts of designs. I never really showed much interest in clothing and picked outfits that would be good in more-or-less any situation, but even still my closet was full of choices. I didn’t really have more than two or three items that were either mended or hand-me-downs.\n\n\n Sewing is something that I learned in Home Economics in school, but even then I used an electric sewing machine to do it. The only time I used a needle and thread was when I needed to sew on a button. To be perfectly frank, if it’s a woman’s job during the winter to spin thread, weave cloth, and sew clothing for her entire family, that’s going to be terrible. I have literally zero interest in doing any of that.\n\n\n Oh, although, if I could maybe use cloth as a substitute for parchment, I’d weave as much as I needed.\n\n\n “Maine, don’t you want to try?” asks Tory, from beside the loom.\n\n\n “No, maybe next time.”\n\n\n She may have been at the loom, but I don’t think she wants to become a weaver. Tory seems to be more interested in becoming a seamstress’s apprentice, so she wants our mother to teach her how to do needlework. I, however, am very small, so my hands aren’t big enough, and, above all, I want nothing to do with any of that, so trying to teach me is entirely pointless.\n\n\n “Okay, Mom, I’m going to go work on weaving baskets. Make me some good clothes!”\n\n\n “Of course, leave it to me. They’ll be the most stunning clothes you’ve ever seen.”\n\n\n My mother, confident in her abilities as a seamstress, works with enthusiasm. Every season, all of the children who recently turned seven years old gather at the church for their baptism ceremonies, wearing their nicest clothes. It’s the perfect opportunity for a mother to display their skill in preparing the perfect outfit for their child. Perhaps she’s thinking of this as some sort of public presentation?\n\n\n Smiling to herself, she selects a new thread to use as the warp, one that’s much thinner than the one Tory had been practicing with.\n\n\n “This really is a fine thread,” she says, smiling wryly as she thinks about how much time it will take to weave it into cloth. “Tory’s baptism is in the summer, so she’ll be too hot if I use too thick of a fabric, right?”\n\n\n “It’s still winter, though,” I say, “Won’t Tory have gotten bigger by summertime?”\n\n\n In the summer, food is more plentiful and children tend to be healthier and move around a lot more, which I think helps them grow up faster. At least, that’s what all of my measurements showed when I was growing up. If these clothes are made to fit now, then they’ll be too small by summertime.\n\n\n “That’s true, but I’ll be able to make adjustments so they’ll still fit just fine. What I’m more worried about is how small you are compared to your sister! I don’t know if Tory’s hand-me-downs will fit you for next year. I wonder what we’re going to have to do then?”\n\n\n That is definitely something to worry about. Good luck, Mother.\n\n\n In what seemed like the blink of an eye, my mother had selected a slender thread that seemed a little more sturdy than one made of wool and started weaving, and Tory has already started working on weaving the baskets she hopes to sell in the springtime. My eyes are starting to adjust, just a little bit, to how gloomy this room is, so it’s time for me to take the first step towards my ambitions and start working on making my pseudo-papyrus.\n\n\n By weaving these grass fibers together, I’m definitely going to be able to make something kind of like a paper. I will never be outdone by the people of ancient Egypt! This is my battle to win!!\n\n\n I lay out my fibers on top of the table. Back in Japan, I once wove a square coaster in a basket-weaving class. If I use that method, then making a postcard-size sheet will be the first step of my victory. I take my fibers, which are even thinner than the thread my mother’s using in her weaving, and start weaving them together into rows and columns, tightly tightly tightly tightly tightly…\n\n\n I may lack money, technology, and experience, but I shall fight on with my determination, my determination, and my determination!\n\n\n Whoa, these are too tiny, I’m really straining my eyes. Ah! I messed up!\n\n\n Tightly tightly tightly tightly tightly…\n\n\n Tightly tightly tightly tightly tightly…\n\n\n These fibers are so slender that it’s not easy for me to undo any mistakes I make. I have to rip apart huge chunks of it. As I wrestle with these tiny fibers with gritted teeth, Tory puts her basket weaving aside and comes over to take a peek at what I’m doing.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine,” she says, “whatcha doing?”\n\n\n “Hm? I’m making ‘pseudo-papyrus’.”\n\n\n Tory takes another look at my handiwork, then tilts her head to the side with a puzzled look. It’s clear by the expression on her face that she didn’t understand anything I just said, nor can she figure out what it is I’m trying to do.\n\n\n Yeah, it would be hard to figure out just from watching, huh? I haven’t even managed to get one square centimeter together, so even I wouldn’t be able to tell that this was going to turn into a pseudo-papyrus.\n\n\n My mother glances over while she weaves her cloth, frowning at the tiny little motions I’m making with my fingers as I’m making my pseudo-papyrus.\n\n\n Tightly tightly tightly tightly tightly…\n\n\n Tightly tightly tightly tightly tightly…\n\n\n “Maine,” she scolds, “if you have time to play around, go help Tory with her basket-weaving.”\n\n\n “Okay. When I’ve got some free time, I’ll go help her, so please don’t raise your voice.”\n\n\n I’m absolutely not playing around here, so I absolutely don’t have any free time. In fact, this is the busiest I’ve ever been ever since I was reborn as Maine.\n\n\n Ah! Another mistake! This is my mother’s fault for raising her voice at me. Aaarrrrgh!\n\n\n Tightly tightly tightly tightly tightly…\n\n\n Tightly tightly tightly tightly tightly…\n\n\n “Maine, really, what are you doing?” asks Tory.\n\n\n “I just said, I’m making 'pseudo-papyrus’!”\n\n\n I don’t have enough patience left to answer her nicely, so my response comes out a little bit curt as I put all of my attention into weaving things tightly tightly tightly tightly… It’s not like I hate doing such fine work, and I’m doing something I actually want to do. I’ve got no choice but to persevere and keep powering through this.\n\n\n Tightly tightly tightly tightly tightly…\n\n\n Tightly tightly tightly tightly tightly…\n\n\n “Hey, Maine,” says Tory. “That’s not going to be very big when you’re done, you know?”\n\n\n “I know!!” I snap.\n\n\n I wasn’t really intending to lash out like that, but Tory’s observation hit a real sore spot and caused the words to fly out of my mouth before I could think about them. It’s already been almost a day, but it’s only about as big as my fingertip. I’m very aware of this fact.\n\n\n Tightly tightly tightly tightly tightly…\n\n\n Tightly tightly tightly tightly tightly…\n\n\n The next day, I sit myself back down in front of my fibers, reminding myself of my determination, my determination. I’m absolutely not going to let Tory get under my skin today.\n\n\n “Hey,” she says, “what happened to that?”\n\n\n “……”\n\n\n I’m not going to let her bug me. I’m not going to let her bug me. What?! It got all loose! Grr! I must still press on, even like this, even if my heart is breaking as I’m forced to make my repairs!\n\n\n Tightly tightly tightly tightly tightly…\n\n\n Tightly tightly tightly tightly tightly…\n\n\n “Hey, Maine—”\n\n\n “Argh!” I yell, clenching my disintegrating pseudo-papyrus in my fist. “This is impossible! I can’t do it! I’ve lost to this 'pseudo-papyrus’!”\n\n\n I’m discouraged to the point where I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to make this into even a postcard-sized sheet. I need to use extremely fine fibers if I want to make something that’s dense enough to use as paper, but it is going to take such a ridiculously long time to make even a postcard-sized sheet. I don’t think that there’s any way I’ll ever be able to prepare enough papyrus to make a single book.\n\n\n Trying to make this postcard-sized papyrus also let me get a feel how the poorly final product would have turned out. The center of the sheet would have been tightly woven, but it would get looser and looser the closer you got to the edges, until it was full of tiny holes. There was no way I’d be able to actually write anything on the entire page.\n\n\n “UuuuUUUUUUuuuuugh… I failed… my papyrus plan failed…”\n\n\n Whether it’s the gathering of raw materials, the difficulty of making it, or the raw time I’d need to spend per-sheet, there’s no way I’d be able to mass-produce any of this. Even if I were to figure out how to make a perfect sheet, I couldn’t make a book out of it.\n\n\n “Be quiet, Maine!” says my mother. “Stop playing with that grass and go make some baskets!”\n\n\n “You can’t make books out of baskets…”\n\n\n “I don’t have any idea what you’ve been talking about, but you failed, didn’t you? That’s enough of that, work on the baskets!”\n\n\n My mother’s getting a little angry, so I’ll go work on the baskets. After all that time weaving the tiny fibers together for my pseudo-papyrus, basket-weaving will be much simpler.\n\n\n “Tory, Mommy… told me to come help you. Gimme some materials.”\n\n\n “Sure,” she says, smiling. “Let me show you how to do it.”\n\n\n With a rustle, she gathers up some materials to hand to me. As I take them, I shake my head distinctly.\n\n\n “No thanks, I already know how.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n Tory blinks, curiously, at me. I put her out of my sight and get to work. The grain of the wood is long and straight, like bamboo. I carefully join everything together, tightly enough that no gaps will be able to form. My plan is to make something like a simple tote bag. I pour all of my efforts into my craft, still fuming about the failure of my pseudo-papyrus. Once I finish tightly weaving the bottom panel, I take a moment to calculate how I’m going to pattern the sides of the bag before I start weaving. I design handles into it as well so that it will be easy to carry without hurting yourself.\n\n\n Where it would have taken me more than five days to finish a postcard-sized sheet of papyrus, it took me just one to make a tote bag. For something made by an unskilled child, it actually looks pretty decent.\n\n\n “Amazing, Maine!” says my mother. “I didn’t know you were so talented at this. Perhaps you should be a craftswoman’s apprentice in the future, hm?”\n\n\n “Eh? That’s, um…”\n\n\n My mother’s eyes are twinkling with pleasure to see her basically good-for-nothing child display this sort of talent (?). I don’t, however, have any plans to become a craftswoman. I have already decided that I am either going to be a librarian or work at a bookstore. Libraries and bookstores don’t really exist in a world without books, though, so those jobs don’t really exist either, but that’s just one small problem.\n\n\n “Ooooh,” whines Tory, “Maine, how are you so good at this?”\n\n\n Tory compares the basket she made with the one that I did, a dejected look on her face as she sees the difference in quality.\n\n\n “Tory,” I say, “don’t worry. If you weave it really tightly and use a pattern like this one, it’ll turn out okay!”\n\n\n Because, really, the difference here is actually a difference of experience. I used to take the advertising inserts out of newspapers, roll them up, and use them as raw materials to make little junk-art boxes in my spare time. I never would have thought that it would ever come in handy, though.\n\n\n “Oooooooh… why’s Maine better than meeee…”\n\n\n Uh oh. I’ve made a mess of her pride as an older sister. Even though it’s much easier for me if Tory treats me like her protege than her rival, I still messed it up.\n\n\n “Um, uhhhh… oh!! Old lady Gerda taught me how to do it when I was left at her place. I’m always doing it over there when you’re in the forest, so I guess I’m getting pretty good. But when I’m making baskets, you’re doing other things, so you’re good at a lot of things that I’m not, right?”\n\n\n I have never had to cheer up a crying child before, so I’m in a little bit of a panic right now. I’m trying very hard to explain things to her, hoping to cheer her up myself, but, honestly, I don’t really even know what I’m talking about.\n\n\n “…I guess you’re right.”\n\n\n I don’t know how much of that story she’s bought, but she cheered up a little bit when I reminded her that there’s things she’s better at than I am.\n\n\n “Right!” she says, “I’m going to make a lot of them this winter, and I’m going to get better than you!”\n\n\n “Okay! Do your best, Tory!”\n\n\n I breathe a sigh of relief now that Tory’s mood has swung back around. Living like this is hard enough already, and doing so without Tory’s help would be even worse. If she always just told me to do it myself, I’d be in serious trouble. I am very glad that I got her to cheer back up.\n\n\n “Ah, Tory! If you just pull a little bit harder here, you can straighten things out and make it look a lot neater.”\n\n\n I may be good at basket weaving, but I’m still so empty inside. All I really want is a book.\n\n\n I’m sitting next to Tory as she weaves her basket and explaining some of the tricks. I keep staring at my failed pseudo-papyrus, though. Papyrus isn’t going to work, so what is my next step going to be? Through the winter, as I help Tory make baskets, I contemplate my future options.\n\n\n Egypt has failed me. The difficulty level is far too high for a child like me.\n\n\n If Egypt is no good, then what’s my next idea? Mesopotamia!\n\n\n Inventors of cuneiform! Bakers of clay tablets! Three cheers for Mesopotamian civilization!\n\n\n Sure, they were ravaged by war and by fire, but their clay tablets survived. I’ll make clay tablets, carve my writing into them, and bake them in the stove. This can work! Plus, since I’ll be kneading clay to form it into these tablets, I can easily pass it off to the adults as just a child playing with clay.\n\n\n I’ve decided! Come springtime, when the snow melts, I’ll make clay tablets!!"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n My name is Lutz. I’m five years old. I’m the youngest out of the four kids in my family. My older brothers are Zasha, Zeke, and Ralph.\n\n\n I woke up this morning to a few faint rays of sunlight flickering through the cracks in our shutters. After days of a raging snowstorm, the sunlight is amazing in a big way.\n\n\n It cleared up!!\n\n\n Not caring at all about how cold the bedroom would get, I spontaneously throw open the shutters so I can look outside. The sky is a stunning blue, completely empty of clouds, and the reflection of the sunlight across the snowdrifts make the entire city sparkle.\n\n\n “Whoaaaa…”\n\n\n Clear days like this are extremely rare, so when they happen both the adults and children immediately head out to the forest. Missing the rush is really bad. I close the window and hurry to the kitchen.\n\n\n “Lutz, hurry up!” says Ralph.\n\n\n “Okay!”\n\n\n Ralph has already finished eating, and is now clattering around trying to get ready. I warm up some hard rye bread1 and eat it while dipping it in milk. As soon as I finish, I run to get dressed. Today is a perfect day for foraging. In order to harvest paru, which can only be found during the winter, everyone in the city rushes out to the forest on clear days like this. If you want to get enough for yourself, you absolutely can’t be last to arrive. Throughout the year, there aren’t very many opportunities to taste something so sweet, so everyone’s absolutely hoping they can get any, whether it’s a lot or even just one.\n\n\n Today, I’m not just going with Ralph. Our older brothers Zasha and Zeke, who usually are working at their apprenticeships, are coming with us today. With four of us foraging, we’re definitely going to find a lot. The four of us strap boxes and bags to our backs and take off running. We dash down the stairs and out of the house. Our mother’s already outside at the water well, and she waves at us as we run past.\n\n\n “You’re heading to the forest now? Be careful, don’t overdo it!”\n\n\n “Got it!”\n\n\n “Hurry!!”\n\n\n My mother is, as usual, gossiping with the neighbors by the well. It’s really admirable how she’s still able to hold these long conversations, even in the middle of this frigid winter. One of the women chatting around the well is Maine and Tory’s mother. Both of our mothers are really good friends, so us kids were also always really close to each other.\n\n\n “Tory and her father have already gone, you know?” she says. “Maybe if you hurry you can catch up?”\n\n\n She didn’t mention Maine’s name. Probably, Maine is helping to watch the house. On days like this, she usually stays in bed instead of coming outside. Now that I think about it, she collapsed in the cart on pig-slaughtering day, just like last year. Last year, they brought her along even though she had a fever, but this year she’d seemed pretty healthy. She missed out on fresh sausage two years in a row now… I feel bad for her.\n\n\n Maine’s so tiny, frail, cute, and unreliable that I think of her like a little sister even though we’re the same age. That reminds me, she had a weird request for some grass stalks while we were preparing for the winter. I wonder what that was about?\n\n\n “Zeke! Check that tree!” says Zasha.\n\n\n “On it!”\n\n\n By the time we arrive at the forest, the paru hunt has already begun. Deep in the snow-bound forest lies a sweet flavor that can’t be harvested except on extremely clear days. The eyes of every single person here are filled with a strange zeal.\n\n\n Zeke runs towards the tree Zasha points him towards and starts to clamber up it. The rest of us start working to build a fire a little ways away from the tree. We shovel the snow away from a patch of ground, then ignite the firewood we brought with us. I glance over and see that Zeke has decided on the fruit he wants to harvest.\n\n\n “Lutz, get ready to start climbing,” says Zeke.\n\n\n “Okay!”\n\n\n I climb up the paru tree to the fruit that Zeke’s picked out. Paru trees are magical. It’s so white that it looks like it’s made out of ice and snow. It has many branches, so it’s easy to climb, but the fruits it produces are very close to the top. If this were a normal tree, I’d use a knife to cut the fruit free, but you can’t use knives to harvest paru fruit. This is the most dangerous part.\n\n\n “Lutz, you ready?” asks Zeke.\n\n\n “One moment,” I reply.\n\n\n I shift over until I’m right behind him, then quickly pull off my gloves. I grab tightly onto the long, slender branch that holds the fruit that Zeke’s been working on.\n\n\n “Ahhh, that’s freezing,” says Zeke. “It’s up to you now. I think it’s almost done, though.”\n\n\n “Yeah, okay!” I say.\n\n\n Zeke lets go and climbs down the tree. The stem that I’m gripping onto is freezing cold, just like ice, and the air itself is frigid. In an instant, all the heat in my hands starts to drain away.\n\n\n Fall quickly!\n\n\n In order to pick a paru fruit, you have to heat up the branch that it’s connected to until it goes soft and limp. However, you absolutely can’t use fire under the tree, because the tree’s magic immediately puts it out. So, you have to use the heat from your hands in order to warm it up. Bit by bit, the branch I’m holding onto starts to grow limp. The fruit, however, still hasn’t fallen.\n\n\n Still not done yet? How long is “almost done”, Zeke?\n\n\n I start to lose feeling in my hands, a painful numbness prickling through them. Right when the thought that I should switch out crosses my mind, the branch I’m sitting on suddenly bends a little bit.\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz, let’s switch,” says Zasha, from behind me.\n\n\n “It just needs a little bit more,” I tell him. “Hey, Ralph! It’s about to fall!”\n\n\n As soon as Zasha grabs hold of the branch, the fruit pops off with a wet noise and starts to fall. Zasha’s hands are far warmer than mine are after having held onto the branch for so long. The fruit, about the size of my face, falls straight down to the ground below.\n\n\n “Go warm up quickly. Your hands are briiight red!”\n\n\n “Yeah,” I reply.\n\n\n Zasha starts looking for the next fruit and moves to a different branch. I immediately put my gloves back on, then climb back down the tree, being extra careful not to fall. I run over to the fire immediately, throw off my gloves, and hold my hands above the brilliantly burning fire to warm them up. As I rub my hands together over and over by the fire, feeling slowly prickles back into my hands.\n\n\n “I’m gonna throw it! …Rrragh!!”\n\n\n Ralph has found the fallen fruit and is brandishing it triumphantly. With a huge swing, he throws it towards Zeke, then starts climbing up the tree to go relieve Zasha. Zeke picks up the fruit and puts it in a basket. Paru fruit are like huge clumps of ice when they’re out in the cold, so you can be as rough with them as you want.\n\n\n “Whoa, cold…, Zeke, switch with me.”\n\n\n “Roger!”\n\n\n Zasha has been warming his hands by the fire, but now it’s Zeke’s turn to throw off his gloves and rub his hands together in the fire’s warmth while Zasha goes back to the tree. Harvesting paru is a job that requires a lot of teamwork: the more people you have with warm hands, the better luck you’ll have.\n\n\n Alternating back and forth like this, we gather five fruits.\n\n\n “It’s getting pretty limp,” says Zeke as I switch out with him.\n\n\n “Got it.”\n\n\n Our sixth fruit was just about to fall when the afternoon sun started to shine into the forest from high above. The leaves of the paru tree sparkle brilliantly in the light, and the tree starts to rustle despite the lack of wind, as if it had a will of its own.\n\n\n “Oh no! Get down quick, Lutz!”\n\n\n The instant I heard my brothers call out, the branch beneath me starts to violently shake. I had been leaning forward just a bit to grab onto another branch, so I lose my footing entirely as the branch bucks under me. With one hand, I cling desperately to the branch I had been holding onto, dangling in mid-air.\n\n\n “Whoa!!”\n\n\n I reach up with my other hand and grab tightly onto the branch, trying to stop myself from falling.\n\n\n “No, don’t, Lutz! Let go! Get down from there now!”\n\n\n As soon as I started to let go, the branch suddenly went limp, warmed by the heat from both my hands. With a crack, it snaps off. The paru fruit and I plummet towards the ground.\n\n\n “WAAAAaaaaa-”\n\n\n The ground beneath the tree is covered in deep, deep snow, and since I was falling feet first after having been dangling from the tree, I land without any serious injury. Around us, other people are jumping out of the other paru trees scattered here and there.\n\n\n The time for gathering is over.\n\n\n The trees shine brilliantly in the light, their countless leaves rustling loudly. They stretch skyward, growing taller as if they’re chasing after the light. Soon, they tower over even the thickest, fullest trees in the forest. Despite there still not being any wind, their branches whip through the air, almost like a woman’s long hair swirls around her as she shakes her head. The unpicked paru fruit fly off in all directions as their branches flick about in the shimmering light.\n\n\n As soon as the fruit all fly off, the paru trees start shrinking as if they’re melting away, and soon vanish into nothingness. Unlike any other tree in the forest, these are magic trees, which can only be found on clear days in the middle of the winter.\n\n\n “It’s over.”\n\n\n “Let’s go home.”\n\n\n Everyone gathers up their bags full of paru fruit and heads for home. Every household is going to spend the whole afternoon working on processing the fruit that they gathered. It’s hard, heavy work, but it’s still kind of fun.\n\n\n “First off, let’s split these up.”\n\n\n Now that it’s in the house, the fruit that was about the size of my face has gotten a little smaller and rounder now that its rind is melting away.\n\n\n “Can you handle getting the bowl ready?”\n\n\n “Yeah!”\n\n\n We light the tip of a small stick on fire using the stove, then press it into the shell of the paru fruit. With a sharp crack, the skin just in that area splits open a little bit, and a milky white juice starts welling up through it. An amazingly sweet smell drifts out to fill the house, and I gulp as my mouth starts to water. So that we don’t lose a single drop of the juice, we’ve placed the fruit in a bowl.\n\n\n This juice, and its sweet, sweet flavor, is extremely precious. I want to do nothing more than drink it all down in one go, but I’ve decided that I’m going to pace myself very, very carefully. For now, all I can do is swallow my saliva as my mouth keeps watering.\n\n\n Once we’ve drained out all the juice from inside, the next step is to crush the fruit and extract all the oil from it. Paru oil can be used both for cooking and for fueling lamps, which makes these fruits extremely welcome in the middle of the winter. Once we’ve pressed all of the oil out, the remains of the fruit are very dry. Once they finish drying, they’re not really suitable for people to eat, but it makes for an excellent, nutritious feed for our chickens. Even better, it causes the flavor of the eggs to change a lot, which I’m also always happy for.\n\n\n “May we come in?”\n\n\n “Sorry to bother you…”\n\n\n For a couple of days after that, we’ve had people constantly coming by, hoping to trade the dried-out fruit remains for eggs from our chickens. From my perspective, I don’t know what I’m going to do when we’ve traded everything away for chicken feed. The chickens will be very happy about this, but all of the eggs that I could have actually eaten are vanishing, right before my eyes.\n\n\n Please, don’t bring us any more chicken feed. Bring me meat! While my older brothers tend to split the eggs evenly among us, they hog all the meat and I barely get any of it.\n\n\n As I was contemplating my pending starvation, Maine and Tory come in, carrying with them some more fruit scraps. Inside their rough nilen bags are about two fruits’ worth of scraps.\n\n\n “Lutz,” says Maine with an enormous smile as she holds out her bag in front of her, “can we trade these for some eggs?”\n\n\n I really don’t want to, but my mother would be furious if I turned them away.\n\n\n “We kinda already have enough chicken feed… do you maybe have any meat?”\n\n\n “Meat?”\n\n\n “My older brothers eat all of it, so I don’t really get any for myself.”\n\n\n During the winter, everyone is home nearly all the time, so my food winds up getting stolen from me a lot and I usually wind up staying hungry. I know that Tory and Maine can’t really do anything about it, but I let my frustration slip out anyway.\n\n\n Tory gives a wry smile. “You’re not as strong as your brothers, so course they’re gonna steal from you,” she jokes, brushing past my dissatisfaction.\n\n\n Maine, for some entirely unknown reason, shoves the bag right towards my face. “Hey, Lutz, why not eat this?”\n\n\n “How the hell am I going to eat chicken feed?!”\n\n\n I am completely blindsided by the fact that Maine, who I always treat so nicely, just suddenly told me to eat chicken feed. The sheer shock of it caused me to reflexively yell out, but Maine just stands there with a blank look on her face, head tilted to one side.\n\n\n “…I guess it depends on how you cook it?”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n “The fruit’s been squeezed totally dry, so you can’t eat it. It’s probably still tasty, though, so even these dried-out bits will be fine to eat if we just cook them right.”\n\n\n Maine is saying these completely unbelievable things with a perfectly straight face. I instinctively glance over at Tory to see what her reaction is. There can’t be anyone who’d eat chicken feed. Tory, however, gives me a tired, worn-out smile and shrugs her shoulders a little bit. For some reason, Maine really does seem to want to eat paru fruit.\n\n\n “You…! Do you know how wasteful it is to eat a paru?! You don’t just eat it, you squeeze out its juice and its oil and then give the rest to the chickens!! There’s no way that we’re just going to waste it by eating it!”\n\n\n I don’t think there’s a single person in this house that lacks enough propriety that they’d turn to eating bird food. On top of that, taking something that we worked so hard to get and just eating it without making full use of it is unbelievable! I don’t think there’s a single person in this entire city who’d think of that except for Maine.\n\n\n “Ummm… if you were going to give it to the chickens that would be okay, but you just said you have enough bird food, right? It’ll be okay to use this to fill us up instead, then.”\n\n\n “Like I’m trying to say, people can’t eat something that’s so dried out!”\n\n\n “It only turned into something people can’t eat after all of the juice and oil was squeezed out of it. If we put some effort into it, we can definitely make it edible again!”\n\n\n “Maine, umm…”\n\n\n My strength leaves me. Maine is saying such unbelievable things with such an earnestly smiling face! What’s this feeling? I feel like I’m not going to convince her no matter what I try to say. Is this helpless sort of feeling what they call a sense of defeat?\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz,” says Tory, quietly. Now would have been the perfect time for her to remind her sister that bird food isn’t something that humans can eat, but instead she weakly hangs her head. “It’s kinda hard to believe,” she says, “but you really can make it edible. …I was even really shocked when I found out how good it was.”\n\n\n Eh? Seriously? She made you eat bird food, Tory?!\n\n\n Somehow, Maine has already demonstrated this working in her own home. I see now, I guess I’m just arguing off of my own self-confidence, huh.\n\n\n “Let’s try it out real quick, okay? Lutz, do you have any paru juice left over?”\n\n\n As she talks, she puts some of the dried-out remains in a little bowl. She adds about two teaspoons’ worth of my share of the fruit juice, then blends it all together. She scoops some up onto her finger and sticks it into her mouth, then nods to herself in satisfaction.\n\n\n “Open wide, Lutz!”\n\n\n Not only is my precious fruit juice being used for this, but I’m about to be fed bird food. I think this is probably going to be terrible, but after seeing Maine taste it as if it were a completely ordinary thing to do, I hesitantly open my mouth. She scoops up a bunch of the yellow stuff onto her fingertip and puts it in my mouth. As I close my mouth again, a sweet flavor radiates through it.\n\n\n Only a little bit of juice went into this, but it’s still so sweet and it doesn’t feel dried-out at all. Every year, I stretch out my share of the juice for as long as I can by drinking only just enough for me to taste it, but if I blend it with the leftovers from the squeezing, I guess I could eat a lot more sweet stuff, right?\n\n\n “It really is sweet, see?” says Maine, chuckling to herself triumphantly. My older brothers, who had been looking on suspiciously from a distance, simultaneously jump in on us.\n\n\n “It’s sweet?”\n\n\n “It’s really sweet?”\n\n\n “Seriously? Lemme try, Lutz.”\n\n\n All three of them charge forward, fingers outstretched, ready to scoop into the little bowl. I try to run away so that they can’t grab onto it, but with such a big difference in physique between us, I can’t escape. I can’t even dodge!\n\n\n “Hey, let go! Stop pulling! Are older brothers only good for stealing their younger brother’s stuff?”\n\n\n “My little brother’s things are my things!”\n\n\n “Sweet things should be shared with everyone.”\n\n\n “Ah-HA! Got it!”\n\n\n I struggle in vain to resist the three of them, but they yank the bowl out of my reach. They take turns scooping the mix out of the bowl with their fingers. “Aaaaa!! My paru!!” I wail, but they completely ignore me. Soon, the bowl is completely empty.\n\n\n “Whoa, tasty.”\n\n\n “This was bird food, right?”\n\n\n Just like mine did, all of their eyes go wide with disbelief, and they look over at Maine. She quickly looks to the side, shying away from all of the attention, but then says something even more unbelievable.\n\n\n “Lutz, since we’re at your house, I can make it even better.”\n\n\n “Seriously?!” shout all of us, simultaneously.\n\n\n It’s completely natural for us to react like that. We’re all growing boys with healthy appetites, after all. Zasha, in particular, is the oldest, and he’s always saying there’s never enough food. Even if it is made from bird food, we are all extremely eager to have another tasty thing to eat.\n\n\n “…Oh, although, I can’t do it if you guys don’t help. …I’m not very strong.”\n\n\n “Alright, leave it to me!” I reply. It’s immediately obvious that Maine is frail and weak. If she needs our help to make us something delicious, I will help with all of my might!\n\n\n “Lutz, don’t hog her attention. Let me help too, Maine, I’m way stronger than Lutz is.”\n\n\n “Yeah, okay!” she says.\n\n\n Suddenly, all of my brothers want to cooperate. I’m left wondering when it will ever be my turn for anything, but Maine looks absolutely delighted as she starts giving us orders.\n\n\n “Okay, hmm. You two older brothers get a griddle ready on the stove. Lutz, you do the prep work, Ralph, you’re in charge of mixing. Ah, also, it would be really mean for everyone to only use Lutz’s juice, so everyone needs to share theirs! Come on, chip in, chip in.”\n\n\n She claps her hands in a very mother-like fashion as she urges my older brothers on. Right now, Maine looks like an angel to me. With a single word, she saved me from having to give up all of my juice by myself.\n\n\n “Lutz, get me two teaspoons of milk. Ralph, grab that spatula and start stirring this, please.”\n\n\n Even though Maine is usually a huge hindrance, right now she’s looking extremely lively as she fires off instruction after instruction while everyone is moving around her. Zasha and Zeke have dragged the griddle on top of the stove and are working on getting it fired up. Ralph, spatula in hand, is vigorously mixing things together as Maine adds them into the bowl. I’m running here and there on Maine’s instructions, picking up the various things she says we need.\n\n\n “Right, this is looking good. Next, do you have any butter?”\n\n\n I run and get it for her. She uses a small spoon to take off a chunk of it, then climbs up on a chair next to the stove and slides it onto the griddle. Every one of our hearts skip a beat when they see what a precarious position she’s in, but she doesn’t seem to notice at all.\n\n\n The butter on the griddle sizzles loudly as it shrinks away. A delicious scent fills the room, and I’m suddenly acutely aware of how hungry I’ve been getting. Maine reaches into the bowl Ralph’s been stirring with a larger spoon, and drops a spoonful of thick, muddy batter on top of the melted butter. As the batter hisses over the fire, the sweet scent of paru mingles with the savoriness of the butter, and I’m almost overwhelmed. What she’s making looks kind of like the potato pancakes my mother makes, but the scent is totally different.\n\n\n “Alright, its your turns, make them like that, please,” she says.\n\n\n After demonstrating how to make one, she passes off the cooking duties to my older brothers, who do not need a chair to reach the stove. Maine, from atop her chair, continues to give directions. That’s fine, though. We understood what we had to do as soon as she showed us, and making her wobble on top of such a tall chair would be too much for us to do. Since it’s way less dangerous for us to do the cooking, my older brothers immediately take her spoon and get to work.\n\n\n “When the bubbles start to rise like that, that side’s done. Start flipping them over, please!”\n\n\n “Got it!” says Zasha.\n\n\n At Maine’s direction, he scoops them up with a spatula, one by one, and neatly flips them over, showing that the underside is now a wonderfully cooked brown. They look so good that I almost start drooling.\n\n\n “Alright, take them off, put them over there, and start more cooking in their place.”\n\n\n We gather up the finished things and put them to the side, then drop more butter and batter onto the pan. Whenever Maine said they were ready, we flipped them over and moved them to the plates.\n\n\n Maine holds the first plate we finished with triumphantly, a huge smile on her face. “Voila! ‘Simple bean curd hotcakes!’”2\n\n\n I actually have no idea what she just said. I don’t really know how I’m supposed to react, so I tilt my head to the side.\n\n\n “…Huh? What did you say?”\n\n\n “Um…,” she says, blinking in surprise. Her face scrunches up for a moment, as if she’s searching for the right words. “The basic parucakes are ready!”3\n\n\n Steam wafts up from the plates of parucakes lined up along the table. I want to dig into them immediately.\n\n\n “They’re hot, so be careful! Please, enjoy your meal~!”\n\n\n Slowly, I take a bite. Shockingly, they’re even more delicious than I thought they were going to be. They’re light and fluffy, and don’t have even a trace of the dryness of bird food. Unlike potato pancakes, these are extremely sweet, even without adding any jam.\n\n\n On top of that, since they’re stacked on each person’s dish one at a time, I don’t have to worry about my brothers taking them all!\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz. If you make these, do you think you’ll be able to fill yourself up easily?”\n\n\n “I do! Wow, Maine, you’re amazing.”\n\n\n Since people keep coming over wanting to trade for eggs, we have a lot of paru leftovers. Our chickens make plenty of eggs for us, and if we can trade some of those for milk, then we should be able to have parucakes all through the winter.\n\n\n “I’ve got some other ideas about how to cook the squeezed-out paru,” says Maine, “but I don’t have the strength to do them myself.”\n\n\n “If you show us how to do it, we’ll make it for you!”\n\n\n After that, Maine continued to come over and imprint on us new ways to cook delicious things every time the weather cleared up and we went to collect more paru. Thanks to Maine teaching us how to cook, I rarely went hungry that winter.\n\n\n Maine is my savior, but she’s also very weak, so I want to help her any way I can.\n\n\n I couldn’t have noticed at the time, I was so immersed in the joy of parucakes, but this would become a huge influence in my life."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n It seems that, in this town, whenever the weather clears up during the winter everyone always goes out to pick paru. Last time this happened, my father had a day off from work, so he went to go pick paru with Tory, but today he’s busy with his job. As I started wondering if that meant that we were going to give up on paru after all, I noticed my mother gathering up her coat.\n\n\n “I’m going to be going with Tory today,” she says.\n\n\n Paru are valuable winter fruit, To my eye, they’re a fruit that contains a syrupy coconut milk, olive oil, and a sweet-ish sort of bean curd. Since I figured out that the remains of the fruit after all of the oil has been squeezed out can be used as a good substitute for bean curd, I’ve been able to expand the house’s menu a little bit. Thanks to that, it looks like my mother’s been increasingly motivated lately.\n\n\n The bean curd hotcakes I made the other day at Lutz’s house were the first sweets I’ve had in ages. Lutz’s family raises chickens in their house, so they have a lot of eggs for trade, which means they have access to a ready supply of milk. I’m envious. Between the abundance of ingredients and the extra manpower that all the boys provide, it’s way easier to cook at Lutz’s house. The bean curd hotcakes… ah, I called them parucakes, didn’t I? The parucakes left everyone deeply moved, and I was able to use paru oil, egg yolk, and a pinch of salt to make mayonnaise. With that and some more salt for seasoning, I was able to make something kind of like a potato salad, which also quickly became very popular.\n\n\n …It looks like my reincarnation has made Lutz’s and his brother’s lives better, at least.\n\n\n There’s so many ways to use a paru that I want to get as many of them here in my house as I can. Unfortunately, I’m absolutely useless on any sort of trip, but I still want to cheer everyone on if I can.\n\n\n Tory, fight! Fight! Mother, win! Win!!\n\n\n However, when Tory and my mother head for the forest, there’s still the problem of what to do with me. In any case, I have no strength, I’m sickly, and I’m worse than useless. There’s literally zero way that I can make a trip into the forest in the dead of winter. To make things worse, they seem to think that I might get up to some sort of trouble if they leave my at home by myself, so it seems they absolutely can’t leave me to watch the house.\n\n\n Isn’t that kind of mean?\n\n\n My father eats his breakfast, pondering deeply, as he gets ready for work. Suddenly, he claps his hands together.\n\n\n “I’ve got it! Maine, how about you come with me to the gates today?”\n\n\n I’d go with my father to the gate. Tory and my mother would go to the forest to gather paru. Then, on their way back, they’d pick me up from the gate. If they do that, the two of them can go pick fruit without worrying about me, and I won’t be left home alone.\n\n\n “Ah, that’s a good idea,” says my mother. “Let’s do that! Tory, let’s head out. We’ll leave Maine with your father today.”\n\n\n “Okay!” says Tory. ”Maine, we’ll come by and pick you up later.”\n\n\n As my mother praises my father for his good idea, she gathers up everything she needs in the blink of an eye and leads Tory out of the house. Paru gathering seems to be something that only happens before noon, so it’s critical that everyone gets there as soon as possible. This is probably because everyone snaps all the fruit up in a heartbeat. It is such a delicious and useful fruit, after all.\n\n\n “Well then, shall we head to the gates?”\n\n\n Being baby-sat at the gates, huh… Well, it’s a change of pace from being here in the house all the time. If Otto’s there, then I can probably get him to teach me some new letters, too…\n\n\n Frankly, I am starting to get really tired of being inside this house. Ever since I failed at making pseudo-papyrus, I have been reduced to only being able to do one of two things: play with the slate and make baskets. I never could have thought that, without books, I would have so much free time and so little idea of what to do with it.\n\n\n By the way, lately, I’ve had “Come, Spring!”1 and “Radio Calisthenics”2 playing in my head. Until spring finally comes around, I can’t go outside and I can’t work on making my clay tablets.\n\n\n Also, I’ve started doing radio calisthenics every morning so that I can build up enough strength to start going outside. My family has been looking at me strangely, but I think that it’s very important for me to do everything I can to get in better shape. To be painfully honest, my physical condition wasn’t something I really paid much attention to back in Japan, so I don’t know exactly where I should be starting from in my exercises.\n\n\n “Oh, Daddy. Is Otto going to be there today?”\n\n\n “Ahh, I think so?”\n\n\n “Yay!”\n\n\n Now I’m actually looking forward to being baby-sat at the gates. I cheerfully go about my own preparations. Since I’m going out, I’ll need to bring my slate. I layer on my clothes and pull on my coat, then I slide the slate into the tote bag I wove earlier this winter. With that, I’m ready to go.\n\n\n “Let’s go, Daddy!”\n\n\n “…Maine, you really like Otto a lot, don’t you?”\n\n\n “Yeah! I love him,” I reply.\n\n\n After all, he gave me this slate to help me learn the alphabet, and he’s my teacher (or so I’ve unilaterally decided). Wouldn’t it be impossible for me not to like him? Honestly, I probably like him more then I like my father. In the interest of maintaining harmonious human relations, though, I clamp my mouth closed so that I don’t actually say that last bit.\n\n\n “Cold!” I exclaim, as we step outside.\n\n\n The air itself is frigid. The faintest of winds is blowing, and that alone is enough to cause a painful chill to cut straight through to my bones. My face is tingling so intensely that, even despite my laziness, I’m thinking that I’m going to have to figure out how to make some kind of moisturizing cream out of some of the paru oil we get today.\n\n\n On top of that, the snow is so deep that I can barely walk. There’s probably some knack to walking on top of snow, but I didn’t grow up in a snowy part of the country so I don’t know it. After only two steps, my tiny child legs were stuck deep in the snow, and I couldn’t move them no matter what I tried. I have no idea what to do next.\n\n\n “Daaaaddy! How do I walk in this?”\n\n\n My father turns around, a startled expression on his face, and walks back towards me, his arms out to the sides for balance as his legs sink into the snow. “…It’s okay, I got you,” he says. He hangs my tote bag from his wrist, then picks me up by my sides, lifts me up high, and deposits me on his shoulders. “Be careful not to fall!”\n\n\n “Whoa… so high!”\n\n\n I’m way higher up than I was before, even when Ralph carried me on his shoulders. I don’t, however, feel like I’m in any danger of falling. My father, the soldier, has broad, firm shoulders, providing both a sense of stability and a sense of security. He’s very different from my other father, who I think was a salaryman in a sales department.\n\n\n “Hold on as tight as you can, okay?”\n\n\n “Okaaay!”\n\n\n It’s been a long time since I rode piggyback, so I’m a little bit excited. I cling tightly to my father’s head as he starts trudging through the snow. There’s a narrow pathway cut through the snow, but it doesn’t seem to have been made with a shovel. Instead, it looks like it was made by people carefully following in each other’s footsteps, one by one, as they left for the main street.\n\n\n “Maine, you should know, Otto’s already married.”\n\n\n We had been walking in silence for a while when those words suddenly tumbled out of his mouth. He seems to have been considering what to say for a while.\n\n\n Huh? Did I… say something about wanting to marry him at some point? I know I didn’t say anything about wanting to marry my father, though.\n\n\n “Ummmm… so, what?”\n\n\n “Well, Otto’s the kind of man who doesn’t think of anyone but his wife.”\n\n\n What kind of parent uses this kind of diversion on his five-year-old daughter, you idiot? Would it be okay if I played the straight man and smacked him on the head now?\n\n\n “Okay, but what’s wrong?”\n\n\n “……”\n\n\n Argh, really?! Now you go quiet? You’re such a pain! I’m not going to play along, father. Do you really think that I’m going to say something like “but Daddy you’re so much more amazing” or “but Daddy I love you so much more” right now?\n\n\n “Oh,” I say, “are you saying that since Otto is the kind of man who loves his wife so much, he’s really amazing?”\n\n\n “…No.”\n\n\n Sulking fiercely, my father continues trudging forward in silence. After some time, we finally arrive at the gate, me still riding atop the shoulders of my troublesome father.\n\n\n “Good morning, sir,” says the soldier stationed at the gate, bowing his head for some strange reason. After a moment, I remember that bowing your head in greeting is one of the social customs here. Then, he bows his head again, maybe for me, perched on top of my father’s shoulders.\n\n\n “Lihit,” says my father, “this is my daughter Maine. I’ll be leaving her in the night duty room until the afternoon, when her mother comes to get her on her way back from picking paru.”\n\n\n “Understood, sir.”\n\n\n “Maine, go to the night duty room. Otto’s in there, so that’ll be fine, right?”\n\n\n Whoaaa, that sounded almost petulant. Huh? Maybe… is my father so jealous of Otto that he’s getting childish? Are human relations breaking down here?\n\n\n “I’m only really looking forward to learning some new letters from him, you know,” I say.\n\n\n “…You don’t need Otto for that.”\n\n\n Sorry, Otto. I tried to smooth things over, but I think I might have only made it wose.\n\n\n At the beginning of this whole mess, I really was only excited about learning new letters, but I have no idea where my father’s thoughts have been wandering to.\n\n\n “I’m coming in,” says my father, knocking on the door to the night duty room as he opens it and walks in. The night room is lit by both a brilliantly glowing fire in the fireplace and a lamp shining on a desk. It’s way brighter than it is back home. Otto is sitting at a desk close to the fire, filling out paperwork.\n\n\n “Otto!” I say.\n\n\n “Corporal… and Maine? Why’s she here?”\n\n\n “She’ll be staying here while her mother’s gathering paru. Take care of her.”\n\n\n He tersely… no, sharply explains the situation while he lowers me down from his shoulders. Otto’s eyes go wide and he glances back and forth between his pile of paperwork and my father. Clearly, he’s been shaken by having being abruptly ordered to be a babysitter.\n\n\n “Huh? Umm, but, I… need to finish the budget and the financial report…”\n\n\n “Maine,” says my father, completely ignoring Otto’s protests, “it’s warm in here. Stay here and take care not to catch a cold.”\n\n\n “Yes, Daddy!” I wave goodbye to him as he leaves the room.\n\n\n I turn towards Otto. “I’m sorry, Otto.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n “You know, I was super happy when you gave me the slate, and I’m even more happy that I get to see you again.”\n\n\n “Oh, that’s good. I’m also happy to see you again, but…”\n\n\n He gives me a bit of an awkward smile, then looks a little confused, as if he’s wondering why I needed to apologize for that.\n\n\n “I was kinda praising you earlier, and my daddy started to sulk.”\n\n\n “…Oh, boy…”\n\n\n “I’ll be really quiet until my mommy comes and picks me up, so could you teach me some new letters?”\n\n\n From the parchment and ink that’s spread out on top of the desk, it’s obvious that he was in the middle of working through some paperwork. I don’t want to be too much of a hindrance, but I’m not going to let this chance to learn more letters slip away.\n\n\n “Sure, why not? Since it’s you, Maine, I know you’ll practice quietly…”\n\n\n I quickly take out my slate. The slate pencil clacks against the surface as Otto writes out new letters, mumbling to himself. At this point, I’ve lost count of the many hours I spent playing with it by myself, so by now I feel a strange sense of confidence.\n\n\n “Maine, if you get another fever, your father’s going to be even more upset than he is now, so sit over here.”\n\n\n With a wry smile, he shuffles his things over, giving me his seat in front of the fireplace. I completely agree with his reasoning, so I don’t restrain myself too much as I sit myself down.\n\n\n “Thank you! I can definitely practice here.”\n\n\n These letters seem to be part of an alphabet. It’s not a syllabic script like hiragana, or an logographic system like kanji. This feels like an alphabet where both pronunciation and meaning change depending on how you spell things.3\n\n\n For a while, the room was quiet, with only the clacking sound of pencil on slate and the scratching sound of pen on parchment breaking through the stillness.\n\n\n When I feel like I’ve memorized the letters in front of me, I look up from my slate. Otto is looking at his parchment, deep in concentration as he works through his calculations. Next to him is some sort of abacus-like calculation device, but I have no idea how to use it. When I was in elementary school, we practiced using an abacus to add and subtract, but I don’t know if the same methods apply to this thing.\n\n\n When it seems that he’s come to a break in his calculations, I ask him a question.\n\n\n “Otto, what’s this?”\n\n\n “I’m working on the financial report and drawing up the budget. We have to come up with a budget for the year during the winter and submit it before spring comes around, but there aren’t very many soldiers who are good at math. I’m the one with the most confidence in my ability to keep track of money, so the task of doing the budget and the financial report falls on me.”\n\n\n “They’ve given you a really difficult job, huh.”\n\n\n When I look over the parchment, I can’t really read the words, but there’s three columns of numbers lined up next to them. The first two look like price and quantity, and the last one seems to be the multiplied total, I think. Is this an equipment requisition form?\n\n\n As I ponder, I notice a mistake in the calculations.\n\n\n “Otto, isn’t this wrong?”\n\n\n “Eh?”\n\n\n “Here, this is 75 and this is 30, right? So, isn’t that 2,250? Ah! This one’s wrong too.”\n\n\n I can read the numbers, but I don’t actually know how to describe multiplication in this language, so I have to describe things in a roundabout fashion.\n\n\n “Eh? I thought you couldn’t read! How can you do these calculations?”\n\n\n “Heh heh heh, my mom taught me numbers when we went to the town market! So, I can look at the numbers, and I can do the math, but I can’t read any of this part over here.”\n\n\n When I say that I can’t read the words next to each entry, Otto starts to ponder something. “Nah… but maybe…” he mumbles to himself, as he broods.\n\n\n “…Maine, I have to fix this. Could you help me out?”\n\n\n Is it really okay for me to take over something like this? Not only is this departmental information, and probably a breach of security, but isn’t letting a child help you out with something like this really bad? Rather, aren’t you really desperate, since you’re asking for help for a child, albeit one with surprising math skill?\n\n\n Not only did he say he had to fix it, he’s asking for help from a child. This really is abnormal. Since he’s putting himself on the line like this, I feel like I want to help him as best as I can.\n\n\n On top of that, he’s got something I really want, and I finally have the bargaining point I was searching for.\n\n\n “Okay. I’ll help you out, if you give me slate pencils and keep helping me learn the alphabet.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n His eyes go wide again. He clearly didn’t expect a little girl like me to suddenly thrust conditions like that on him. This was exactly the response I was expecting, so, with a little chuckle, I explain the present situation.\n\n\n “Like I said, my mom taught me all my numbers. I still don’t know letters, though, so I want you to teach them to me.”\n\n\n “Teaching you is fine, but… slate pencils? Those aren’t very expensive, you know?”\n\n\n Just like Otto says, slate pencils are available for sale in the town market. In reality, they’re something that I actually got my mother to buy for me. So, I know they’re pretty easy to go out and buy. However, it’s a lot harder for me, personally, to obtain them.\n\n\n “My mommy bought some for me a while ago, but she doesn’t really want to buy me any more.”\n\n\n “Why’s that?”\n\n\n “It’s probably because I spend so much time playing with the slate. I use them all up as soon as she buys them for me…”\n\n\n “Ahahahahahaha!”\n\n\n Since I spend countless hours every day playing with the slate, the pencils wear down to nubs very quickly. Since I don’t get any pocket money for myself, you could say that finding a way to get more slate pencils is a matter of life and death for me.\n\n\n “A… anyhow!” I say. “My time isn’t so cheap that I’d work for free, you know!”\n\n\n “…Your time is still really cheap, though,” says Otto, smiling wryly.\n\n\n Otto has now officially become my writing tutor. It looks like I wasn’t wrong about these being equipment requisition forms, but it looks like he’s in the middle of validating the math on someone else’s paperwork.\n\n\n “What should I do?” I ask.\n\n\n “Could you check to see if anything here is wrong? In any event, I don’t know where the errors might be hiding. It’s going to take a while to get through all of this.”\n\n\n It should be obvious, but there aren’t any computers here, so drawing up these documents takes time, but going through and checking every single calculation in this document is more work than one person alone can handle.\n\n\n “There’s other soldiers that can do math, huh?”\n\n\n “…That’s true, but I can do it, and I’ve got a pretty good reason to do it too…”\n\n\n Somehow, it looks like Otto has some sort of circumstances behind why he became a soldier. I really want some juicy information, so I’m itching to ask him to go into more detail, but there’s a lot of validation work ahead of us to be done. I sit tight, knowing that there will be plenty of time for gossip when I see him next time.\n\n\n “Maine, do you want to use the calculator?”\n\n\n “No thanks, I don’t know how to use it, so I’m fine for now. I’ll work things out on my slate.”\n\n\n It’s way easier for me to do calculations on my erasable slate than it would be to do so on a blank form. I start to work through the numbers by hand, using my slate. Numbers were drilled into my head from such an early age, though, that the first symbol that pops into my head is “9”. With some effort, I make sure that I’m properly using the numerals of this world.\n\n\n “Whoa, this is much easier. I’m moved! You’ve seriously saved me. I never thought that validating those calculations could go so quickly! If you can do this much math, Maine, you could definitely be a merchant some day. If you do, I can introduce you to the merchant’s guild, okay?”\n\n\n It seems that for several years, Otto has had to compile all of the budgets and make all of the financial reports all by himself. Even though all we did today was checking everything, Otto is still so deeply grateful. If I were to be in a position to make a lot of books, then the best way to turn that into a bookstore would be to join the merchant’s guild. I’ve made an important connection in a really unexpected place. On top of that, I’ve earned some recognition as Otto’s invaluable assistant.\n\n\n “Maine, if you want to learn how to write, then I’ll help you beat them into your skull, okay? If you do that, then you can help me write up all the papers, too.”\n\n\n “Really?! Woohoo!!”\n\n\n “Huh? That got you excited?”\n\n\n Otto’s eyes may be going wide with shock, but if he’s going to seriously teach me the alphabet, then it’s only natural that I’d be happy, right? And if I’m helping out with official paperwork, that means I’ll get to touch parchment, right? And write letters onto a page with real ink, right? Isn’t that such a joyous thing?\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Maine, sorry to keep you waiting.”\n\n\n “Let’s go home!”\n\n\n Today I did more math than I’ve done in a long while, so it was a great workout for my brain. I’m so mentally fatigued that the inside of my head feels numb. It’s a pleasant feeling. This was an incredibly productive day.\n\n\n “Thanks, Otto! I’m really grateful for your help.”\n\n\n “Yours too, Maine. You saved me a lot of time.”\n\n\n “See you in a bit, Daddy! Good luck with your work!”\n\n\n “Yep,” he says, tersely.\n\n\n It’s been a few hours, but my father is still in a bad mood. Or maybe, did it get even worse?\n\n\n Why?"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n A few days after I was baby-sat at the gate, my mother finally finished the brand new outfit she’d been working so hard on for Tory. It’s essentially a one-piece dress, made from unbleached cloth, with a straight, clean silhouette. The hems of the neckline and sleeves are embroidered with a simple design, and the whole thing is tied together with a wide sash of cool blue cloth, accentuating the outfit.\n\n\n Cute things are cute, but… it looks a little unsatisfactory to me. In Japan, when kids visit shrines on Shichi-Go-San1, the kimono and dresses that they wear are all very showy and colorful so that they’ll look good for their photos. Or, at least, that’s the image the photography studios keep feeding us in their ads.\n\n\n “What do you think, Maine? Isn’t it cute?”\n\n\n If you wanted to, you could make it a little bit more fluttery, or maybe add some more decorations. Either of those things would make it so much cuter…\n\n\n I may be saying that to myself deep in my heart, but my mother looks so proud of her handiwork and Tory looks so pleased with her new dress that I guess it’s already more than good enough. This isn’t an outfit that you’re going to have a picture taken of for your own self-satisfaction, this is something that’s going to be worn to a temple. It’s entirely possible that wearing something flashy would be frowned upon. I don’t think I should really comment on Tory’s clothing right now, since I don’t actually know any of the things that are apparently common sense in this world.\n\n\n I have found one thing I can comment on, though: her hair. Regular care may have made it glossy and smooth, but she always wears it in exactly the same way, in a single thick three-part braid behind her. If we were to change up her hairstyle for her baptism ceremony, I wonder what people would think of some tasteful hair ornaments.\n\n\n However, whatever I do, I can’t actually get started until I learn what the customs are here. Maine was a very young child, after all, and she didn’t really have any memories of baptism ceremonies at all.\n\n\n “Tory,” I say, “it’s really cute! …But, what about your hair? You’ve got to decide what sort of hairstyle you want for your baptism ceremony.”\n\n\n “I was going to just go like this, though…?”\n\n\n …Tory, that’s not good at all. This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, put a little more thought into your fashion choices.\n\n\n Unintentionally, my head drops down in exasperation. I pull myself together and find a new angle to continue my questioning. If Tory’s hairstyle isn’t going to change, maybe we can add some sort of decoration to it.\n\n\n “Ummm… so, what about ornaments? Are you going to use any?”\n\n\n “Oh, hmm… it’s summertime, so maybe I’ll pick some flowers somewhere?”\n\n\n “Whoa, don’t do that! Your dress is too cute for that!”\n\n\n She’s just casually talking like she’s going to pick whatever flowers she manages to find lying around! Haven’t you heard of coordinating an outfit?! …Ahh, of course not.\n\n\n Here, it seems like it’s weird for a child to wear their hair up. It’s okay for it to be braided, though, or to have ornaments in it. If Tory doesn’t have any, it should be okay for me to make them for her. I’d be able to make some sort of lacework, I think. I’ve got plenty of time until summer, so I don’t think I’ll have any problems.\n\n\n “I’ll do something! Leave it to me, Tory. I’ll definitely make you even cuter.”\n\n\n Immediately after I made that declaration, I suddenly realize that we don’t have any needles for lacework. My mother has large needles that she uses for knitting, but they’re too large for me to make lace with.\n\n\n Wh… what should I do?!\n\n\n My father’s the only one in the family who seems like he’d be able to make things like tools. Tory may have made my hair sticks, but the one who shaved it smooth so it was easy to use, then stained it with oil was actually my father.\n\n\n I surreptitiously sneak a glance at my father, trying to gauge his mood. It’s already been a few days since I’d gone to the gate and Otto had agreed to help me learn to write, but my father has been in a pretty foul mood ever since. He doesn’t really look like he’s in the mood to be pestered, but I don’t think he’ll get less angry at me if I just leave him alone.\n\n\n Honestly, my father is being pretty childish, so it’s up to me to be the adult here. If I read between the lines, it’s almost like he wants me to say something. If I fawn on him a little bit and pester him to do something for me, I think I might be able to not only get him to make me some needles, but also cheer him up, killing two birds with one stone.\n\n\n “Daddy, daddy!” I say.\n\n\n “What?”\n\n\n “Daddy, you’re really good at making stuff, right? You’re the one who made Tory’s doll, right?”\n\n\n “Y… yeah, that’s right.” He clears his throat. “Ahh, what is it, do you want a doll of your own?”\n\n\n He’s keeping an expression on his face like he’s still angry with me, but there’s a little glimmer of anticipation in his eyes as he glances over at me.\n\n\n “Nuh-uh,” I say. “I want some knitting needles.”\n\n\n “Needles? Can’t you use the ones your mother has? I think she’ll lend them to you, right?”\n\n\n As he answered me, a supremely dejected expression falls over his face. Waves of misery pour off of him, like he’s had enough just wants to smooth things over already.\n\n\n He waves his hand, shooing me, as if he’s telling me to just go away in a manner that’s not very becoming of a parent. At the very least, I’m going to make him hear me out.\n\n\n “I need needles that are way smaller than the ones Mommy has. I want needles that can knit thread, not yarn. …Daddy, these need to be really skinny, and I think making them would be difficult. Can you do it?”\n\n\n I look up at him with glistening, upturned eyes, hands clasped in front of my chest, in the cutest begging pose I can possibly make. I don’t know if the Japanese standards of 2-D cuteness apply in this world, but there’s no doting parent in any world that doesn’t find their own daughter adorable… so I think this is probably cute enough. Whether it’s due to my cuteness or not, my father scratches at his stubbly chin, contemplating.\n\n\n “Hmm… is wood okay?”\n\n\n “Yeah! Can you do it?”\n\n\n “I’ll try.”\n\n\n His fatherly pride stimulated a little bit, he immediately stands up and heads towards the storage room. After rummaging around for a while, he comes back out with a few different knives and some wood, then sits down and starts to whittle. In his experienced hands, the work goes very quickly. The knife whispers as it shaves away at the wood, and in the blink of an eye all of the bark has been stripped off, leaving only the dense, hard core. He looks closely at the knitting needles, then, skillfully and carefully, starts whittling the wood down into the same shape.\n\n\n “If those needles are sized for wool,” he asks, “does this look about right for thread?”\n\n\n “Umm, can you make them a little bit skinnier?”\n\n\n “Like this?”\n\n\n “Like that!”\n\n\n With the proper size now determined, he changes to another knife, and starts to carve the hook ends of the knitting needles. I can’t say he’s as good as a real craftsman, but this is something that I can’t do myself at all, so I praise him anyway.\n\n\n “Amazing, Daddy! They’re already looking great. Do you think that when you’re done, you can polish them really smooth and oil them so that they don’t catch any thread? I’d really really appreciate it.”\n\n\n “Sure, leave it to me.”\n\n\n Being praised by his daughter has brought back a lot of his fatherly confidence, it seems. He carefully polishes each needle, in fine spirits.\n\n\n Heh, just as planned.\n\n\n While a dark smile flickers over my face, Tory beams angelically, the very picture of pure innocence.\n\n\n “Maine,” she says, “looks like Dad’s finally in a good mood again. That’s a relief.”\n\n\n “Yeah, yeah, it really is!”\n\n\n Don’t say anything about how I was the reason my dad was in a bad mood. Definitely don’t say anything about how I thought fawning over my father was troublesome, so I left him alone without bothering to read the mood. I’m just a little girl, after all, so please treat me as if I don’t know anything about bad moods.\n\n\n My father’s still been working hard on polishing the needles. It looks like they’re almost ready to be used, so I start looking for thread. The ample stockpile of thread that my mother had prepared to use for Tory’s dress has almost all dwindled away. There should be some sort of thread available that isn’t the unbleached white thread that my mother used to make the cloth for the dress. However, the colorful threads that were used to make the sash and the trimmings aren’t in long enough pieces to really make cloth out of.\n\n\n “Mommy, can I have some threads dyed this color?”\n\n\n “What do you want to do?”\n\n\n My mother clearly never thought that I’d ask for thread, so her eyes momentarily grow wide with surprise before she puts on a dubious frown.\n\n\n “I thought I’d make some ‘lacework’,” I reply.\n\n\n “Eh?”\n\n\n “I want to make something to put in Tory’s hair.”\n\n\n My mother back in Japan didn’t just turn advertisements into paper baskets. She kept bouncing around, getting swept up in one kind of handicraft after another. It wasn’t any of her business, but she wanted to get me into hobbies that weren’t just reading books, so she dragged me behind her as she went through this crafting boom. In other words, my list of miscellaneous crafting skills is rather large.\n\n\n Really, among all the handicrafts on my list, lacework is one of the ones that can make a useful finished product. I’m actually quite confident that I’ll be able to make hair ornaments, assuming I have the tools and materials. My life as Urano may be over, but I have no idea what sorts of knowledge I have that might be useful in the future.\n\n\n However, my mother in this world has no knowledge of my former identity, so she seems to disapprove of my request for some thread. There’s no doubt in my mind that she’s thinking that I’m going to do something useless again, so anything she hands over to me will wind up being wasted.\n\n\n “If you’re making hair ornaments, those aren’t really going to be useful except at the baptismal ceremony, you know? It’s a waste to use up our thread on such an inconsequential decoration. Flowers are more than enough for a hair ornament. Tory’s already cute, you don’t need to make her any cuter.”\n\n\n “If you can make something cuter, you must! Cuteness is justice!” I cry, clenching my fist tightly.\n\n\n My mother, for whatever reason, lets out a sigh, then turns away as if the conversation is already over. I quickly reach out and grab her skirt.\n\n\n “Hey, Mommy,” I beg, “I’d be okay with just these leftovers here. Daddy worked hard to make these needles for me, and I really want to use them. Let me just try, please?”\n\n\n I look over at my father, trying to hint that those needles might wind up being worthless. If he got my meaning, or if he realized that his work might be in vain, or maybe even if he was afraid that I’d lose all of my new-found respect for him, he speaks up in my defense.\n\n\n “It’s rare for Maine to take this much interest in sewing, so what do you think about just letting her have the remnants?”\n\n\n My mother ponders for a bit. “…Hm, I guess you’re right,” she says, a reluctant expression on her face.\n\n\n She picks out a few threads and hands them over to me. They’re short enough that it might actually be difficult to use them.\n\n\n “Woohoo! Thanks, Mommy! I love you, Daddy!”\n\n\n I throw up my hands in celebration. My father looks at me with exaggerated pleasure, grinning with his mouth almost hanging open. He suddenly puts way more strength into polishing the knitting needles, a huge smile on his face. If I may be perfectly honest, it’s kind of creepy.\n\n\n His mood does seem to be a lot better, though. He’s acting a little weird, so… it’ll be better if I just leave him alone, right?\n\n\n My father gives me the needles, which have been stuffed full of his overbearing affection. I immediately get to work weaving lace. I’m going to make a lot of tiny lace flowers.\n\n\n Tightly, tightly, tightly, tightly…\n\n\n Much like my failed attempts to make pseudo-papyrus, making lace involves a lot of tight, tiny weaving and a lot of patience. Even if I acknowledge it, though, because the flower that I’ve been working on is so small, it took me about fifteen minutes to finish a single one. I let the yellow flower roll off my hand and onto the table, then start working on the next one. Tory looks at the little lace flower admiringly, then peers at it closely, tilting her head to once side with a doubtful expression on her face.\n\n\n “Isn’t it kinda too small?”\n\n\n “I’m going to put a lot of them together as decoration.”\n\n\n “Huh…”\n\n\n If I made a big one, it would be really bad if I started losing interest before I was finished, right?\n\n\n I keep the real reason to myself. I really let my big mouth get away from me when I started talking about hair ornaments, so I really need to make sure I finish something, which is why I decided to use a design that I can give up on halfway and still wind up with a usable result, like a collection of tiny flowers. Truthfully, back when I was Urano, I’d always decide I didn’t like working on huge designs and wind up giving up halfway through. I need to limit how much that might hurt me.\n\n\n “I thought about making lace or ribbon, but I don’t think I could connect these threads since they’re not very long. Plus, it would be weird if the color changed partway through, right? So I’m going to make a bunch of tiny flowers.”\n\n\n “Wow, Maine, you really thought this through.”\n\n\n “Of course! It’s cause I’m doing it for you.”\n\n\n I thought through many things before starting this. The final product is going to be made out of whatever I get done in the end, so I can finish it even when I get tired of working on it. Plus, this isn’t going to waste any thread, since I can always finish up my current flower and start a new one of a different color when I start to run out.\n\n\n Tightly, tightly, tightly, tightly…\n\n\n Once I’ve finished making a few more tiny flowers, I feel like someone’s watching me. I glance up and see that my work has piqued my mother’s curiosity, and she’s carefully watching what I’m doing with my hands. My mother is good enough at sewing that she’s thought of as a “beautiful” woman by this place’s standards, and it looks like she’s pretty interested in my handiwork. She picks up one of my completed flowers and rolls it around in the palm of her hand.\n\n\n “…This doesn’t seem to be too difficult,” she says.\n\n\n “You already knit a lot with wool, Mommy, so if you learn a few patterns I think you’d be way better at making these than I am, right? Want to try?”\n\n\n I hand over my needles. My mother starts to knit, her motions fluid even as she studies the flowers. She occasionally picks one up and rolls it around in her fingers, confirming the way they’re woven. In the blink of an eye, she’s already finished one.\n\n\n Whoa. As expected of the sewing skills of a beautiful woman. Just by looking at how something’s stitched, she figured out how to make it herself. She’s so different from me. I had to be taught how to do this step by step, grumbling the entire time.\n\n\n “Amazing, Mommy.”\n\n\n “Well, I’m amazed you knew how to make something like this, Maine,” she says. “I’ve knitted scarves and sweaters, but I never thought to knit decorations like this.”\n\n\n Everyone in this world has their hands so full with just surviving that nobody has the spare time to think about decoration. And, if nobody’s making it, then maybe lacework itself is something that nobody’s seen before. I was raised in a world where sewing decorations onto clothing was only natural, so I knew about it, but it looks like even tiny decorations like these aren’t really known of here.\n\n\n “So, Maine, now that we’ve made a lot of these flowers, how are you going to decorate Tory’s hair?”\n\n\n It seems like my mother can’t tell how all the little flowers rolling around on the table are going to be assembled into a finished product. I need to explain things to her in the simplest possible way I can think of.\n\n\n “Ummm… so we take these scraps of fabric and make them into a circle, and then sew the flowers on one by one. It’ll look like a bouquet of flowers after that, right? Then, we wrap that around a 'hairpin’, and… wait, 'hairpin’?!”\n\n\n In the middle of my explanation, all of the blood suddenly drains from my face. My mother jumps, startled, as I suddenly raise my voice.\n\n\n “Maine, what are you yelling about all of a sudden?”\n\n\n “…Oh no, what do I do… I don’t have a 'hairpin’, huh…”\n\n\n This is really bad! There’s no hairpins in this world, or at the very least I haven’t seen any in this house. I haven’t seen any elastic hairbands either. This is a world where everyone ties their hair back with string. How the hell am I going to finish this off?!\n\n\n “D… D-d-d… Daddyyyy!”\n\n\n I immediately abandon my plan to leave my father alone. I rush over to him, taking up my begging posture again. Describing a hairpin by words alone is going to be difficult, so I take out my slate and draw a picture as I explain it to him.\n\n\n “I need one side of it to be pointy, like my hair sticks, and then the other side needs to be flat, like this, with a little hole drilled into it. It’s kinda like my hair sticks, but shorter. Can you do it?!”\n\n\n “Sure, this is actually simpler than those knitting needles.”\n\n\n “Really?! Daddy, you’re amazing! Now more than ever, you’re the best!!”\n\n\n I hug him tightly in a gratuitous display of overflowing gratitude. “Heh heh heh, leave it to me,” he says, quietly. It seems like he still feels the need to compete with Otto.\n\n\n My father cheerfully whittles a somewhat short hairpin for me. I sew together the lace mini-bouquet, then thread it through the hole in the hairpin, kind of like I’m sewing on a button.\n\n\n “Alright, done! Tory, put on your new dress and come over here!”\n\n\n Tory puts on her summer dress, then comes over to sit in the chair closest to the fire. I scoot my own chair over behind her, then kick off my shoes and climb up to stand on top of it. I undo her braid, comb it out, then loosely weave together hair from both sides of her head. Tory’s hair is naturally wavy and fluffy, like it’s permed, so I bring it back and weave it so it’s half-up.2 This hairstyle on her gives off an amazingly showy atmosphere.\n\n\n I tie up the center of the braid tightly with a simple cord, then stick the hairpin through the knot so that it won’t fall off. Against Tory’s blue-green hair, the little flowers of blue, yellow, and white seem to shine.\n\n\n “Yep, cute!” I say.\n\n\n “Wow, really!” says my mother. “You look very cute, Tory.”\n\n\n “Maine, you’re pretty skilled with your hands,” says my father. “You might not be strong, but we can probably find you a job that needs nimble fingers like yours.”\n\n\n Tory smiles shyly as the family admires her, turning this way and that to show off. She reaches up to feel the hairpin, but after a little while she puffs her cheeks out in frustration.\n\n\n “Maine,” she says, “you put everything in the back, so I can’t see it at all, you know?”\n\n\n “I guess so, but… I can’t really help you there.”\n\n\n “But, I don’t really know what I look like right now.”\n\n\n We don’t have any mirrors in this house, so there’s no real way for me to show her what she looks like. I think about what I should do for a little while as Tory’s face grows unhappier and unhappier. I try to show her on my own head, pulling the mini-bouquet out of her hair and sticking it into mine, next to my own hair sticks.\n\n\n “It looks kind of like this! What do you think?”\n\n\n As soon as she sees the hairpin in my hair, Tory cheers loudly. “Whoa, cute! Amazing! Hey, Mom. Does my hair look like that?”\n\n\n “Well, Maine’s hair is straighter and all done up, and the colors of the threads we used match your hair much better. It definitely suits you more, Tory.”\n\n\n “Ahh, really… I see! Hee hee hee…”\n\n\n Her cheeks flush red and she smiles so wide that it looks like she might crack her face in two. She pulls her hairpin from my hair.\n\n\n “Thanks, everyone! I’m super happy.”\n\n\n With spring just around the corner, we have made Tory a perfectly coordinated outfit. If I’m not mistaken, she’s easily going to be the most eye-catching girl at this summer’s baptismal ceremony.\n\n\n After that, my mother got really into doing her own lacework, and the needles my father made for me suddenly disappeared into my mother’s sewing kit.\n\n\n …Well, that’s okay, I guess."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The snow in the forest has begun to melt, and the tiny sprouts of new plants have begun to appear. That’s what Tory told me, when she came back from there. The children have started heading to the forest again to forage, which means that my long, idle hibernation where I had nothing to read and too much time on my hands is over at last.\n\n\n Finally, I can make my clay tablets! I really want to head to the forest as well, so that I can get to work.\n\n\n Tory said that there’s still a lot of snow left, walking is difficult due to treacherous footing, and there’s not very much out there to gather right now. However, I don’t particularly care if there’s a lot of stuff to gather or there’s nothing at all.\n\n\n What I’m after is slimy, clay-like earth, which means excavation. If I can just get to the forest, I’ve already won.\n\n\n Of course, there’s no way that anyone would let me head out to the forest by myself. I need to get Tory to supervise me. So, I’ve drawn up close to her in order to beg for her kindness.\n\n\n “Please, Tory! I wanna go to the forest too, and make friends with the other kids. Could you take me along with you, please?”\n\n\n “No way, you can’t even walk that far.”\n\n\n Her answer hasn’t changed at all. If she’s going to keep having this little confidence in me, I’m facing total defeat here.\n\n\n “I’ve gotten a little stronger! If I can’t go with you, I can wait for you at the gates! Pleeease!”\n\n\n Tory hesitates. I’ve been doing radio calisthenics every day, eating as much as I can, and going out with Tory when she goes downstairs to the well to wash the dishes. I’ve worked hard to boost my strength, and I think I’m just about ready.\n\n\n “…If Dad says it’s okay,” she says.\n\n\n Giving up on just shooing me away, she foists responsibility off on my father. Practically, though, if I were to end up waiting at the gate, I was going to need to ask my father anyway, so this was inevitable. Next, I must persuade my father.\n\n\n “Daddy, can I go to the forest? I haven’t gotten sick in a while!”\n\n\n “Hmmm, that is true…”\n\n\n During the winter, I took extra good care of my health, and the rate at which my fevers spiked went down. I only got five of them!\n\n\n Ah, that’s not a lot, you know? That’s way lower than it once was. My family even kept admiring how much healthier I was, saying “whoa, amazing” and so on.\n\n\n Since my fevers didn’t come very often, I was able to keep a lot more food down. As a result, naturally, my nutritional intake was way better, and I’ve even grown a bit! Most likely, my physical strength has increased as well.\n\n\n “If I can’t make it for some reason, I can rest at the gates with you! Well? Well?”\n\n\n “Hmmmmm,” he says, thinking things over.\n\n\n He didn’t dismiss the notion immediately, so I think I might actually have a chance with him, unlike Tory. I cling to him desperately, trying to get his approval.\n\n\n “Once I get used to it, I’ll make it through! There’s three-year-olds that go to the forest, right? So it’s not impossible that I could do it!”\n\n\n “Ahh, well… sure, there are, but they’re the kinds of kids that get into trouble when they’re left alone at home, so they have to get brought along.”\n\n\n “…So, if I get in trouble, I’ll get to go?”\n\n\n “No need to do that,” he scolds. “Don’t be stupid.”\n\n\n If I can’t somehow secure my father’s permission, then when springtime comes around and my mother goes back to work, I’m going to be left once again in the care of old lady Gerda. That would be very hard on my mental state. Absolutely no way. I don’t want to have to look after all the other children left with her.\n\n\n “Daddy, are you worried about me because I’m not very strong? How can I make you think that it’s okay if I go out to the forest?”\n\n\n “Hmmm, let me think…”\n\n\n My father closes his eyes, deep in thought. I wait breathlessly for his reply.\n\n\n “…For now, just come with me to the gate.”\n\n\n “Only to the gate? How long is ‘for now’?”\n\n\n “Until you can walk all the way to the gate without help. Once you can walk without slowing everyone down, you’ll be okay to head into the forest.”\n\n\n As I expected, it isn’t quite so easy to get permission to go out to the forest. It feels like the clay tablets I’ve staked my ambitions on are getting further and further away. Working to build my strength by walking to and from my father’s workplace at the gate is probably the biggest compromise the completely unreliable me can squeeze out.\n\n\n Tch, I really wanted to go, too. My tablets…\n\n\n I can’t go to the forest, but at the very least this plan means that I don’t have to stay with old lady Gerda. This is an acceptable compromise.\n\n\n “…Okay. I’ll do what you said!” I say, nodding once in agreement.\n\n\n My father suddenly looks relieved, all the tension draining from his face. Did he really think I wasn’t going to agree, and that I’d start running amok?\n\n\n “Hey, Daddy. When you said you wanted me to walk to the gate, do you mean just going back and forth?”\n\n\n “Nah, I’ll have Otto teach you some more of the alphabet,” he says. “Eh?! …Really?”\n\n\n I thought that my father burned with seething jealousy over how Otto was teaching me how to write. I wonder what caused this sudden transformation? I tilt my head to the side doubtfully, and my dad’s eyebrows furrow a little bit.\n\n\n “Maine, you’re pretty weak, but Otto says you’re very smart. He says that you’d be very suited to a job that required you to use your brain, when it comes time to find you one, so if you learn your letters now, you can find a job that’s a little easier on your body.”\n\n\n Otto convinced my muscle-brained, excessively doting father of that? He really is wonderful. I’m getting a little misty-eyed. I did not at all expect that I’d get official fatherly approval for Otto to teach me how to write.\n\n\n “You’re good with your hands, so I was thinking that you could find a job using those, but there’s a lot more money, and a lot less strain on your body, in jobs that require thinking.”\n\n\n “Jobs that require thinking? Like what?”\n\n\n It never actually occurred to me that there might be jobs in this world that relied on brainpower. It seems that there are jobs where the labor is mental, not physical, huh?\n\n\n “Let me see… You could work as an amanuensis, copying out official documents for government officials and aristocrats. I heard that if you do that, you can bring your work home with you if you get sick.”\n\n\n Being paid to write out documents sounds kind of like a notary public, huh. If it’s like that, and I had the right qualifications, then I probably could bring work home if I needed to. I’m not really sure, though, because I don’t have any qualifications.\n\n\n “Otto is a soldier now, but he was originally a trader, and he still has ties with the commerce guild. The kinds of jobs that your mother and I could refer you to wouldn’t really suit you, I don’t think, so you should be grateful for Otto’s connections.”\n\n\n …My jealous, immature father is suddenly looking like a fine example of parenthood!\n\n\n “Thanks, Daddy. I’ll try my hardest!”\n\n\n He pats me lightly on the head, then turns to Tory.\n\n\n “Tory, will you help out?”\n\n\n “…She can’t do it,” she says, shaking her head.\n\n\n Tory is refusing to listen to a single word of her little sister’s wish to come along to the forest. She shakes her head vigorously, all the way back and forth. Not trying to dismiss her concerns, my father nods slowly in comprehension.\n\n\n “I understand, but, Maine’s going to be in trouble if she never gets strong enough to go to the forest.”\n\n\n “I guess so, but… she’ll get in the way…”\n\n\n “That’s right. Right now, she’ll just be a hindrance.”\n\n\n Both Tory and my father quite plainly said I am a hindrance. I already know that myself, but hearing them affirm it right in front of me like is still a blow to my pride.\n\n\n “If she can at least get to the point where she can keep up with you, then even if she can’t go all the way to the forest, she’ll come with you as far as the gate. Until she can make it to the gate herself, I’ll be the one to go with her, but when she’s ready I hope you’ll cooperate too.” “…Okay, I’ll try.”\n\n\n Tory, the burden of responsibility weighing down on her, nods her head in agreement. My shoulders, however, still slump. It seems that my family’s estimation of my strength is still the lowest it could possibly be.\n\n\n I see… they still don’t think I’ll be able to walk all the way to the gate, even though I’ve been going all the way up and down those stairs to get to the water well lately without being out of breath at all…\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, as the sun climbs high in the sky, my father and I set out for the gates. I only follow along with him when he has the day shift. Guard duty operates on a three-shift system. The morning shift lasts from when the gates are opened in the morning, until about noon, the day shift then goes until the gates are closed in the evening, and the night watch guards the gates from when they are closed in the evening until when they are opened once again the next morning.\n\n\n Until I can walk all the way to the gates by myself, I accompany my father to the gates on his day shift, then I either go back with Tory if I’m feeling up for it at the time or I wait for my father to finish his duties and go home with him.\n\n\n “Make sure Maine doesn’t overdo it,” says my mother to my father. “Keep a close eye on her!”\n\n\n “Ahhh, of course,” he replies. “Let’s go, Maine!”\n\n\n “Bye, Mom!”\n\n\n Waving goodbye to my worried mother, I grab my father’s hand and head off for the gates. Making it all the way down the stairs doesn’t give me much trouble anymore, but by the time we make it out to the main street, I’m starting to feel a little out of breath. Come to think of it, this is the first time I’ve ever walked out this far on my own. I’m usually being carried on someone’s back, riding in a wagon, or riding piggyback on someone’s shoulders by this point.\n\n\n “How are you holding up, Maine?”\n\n\n “I’m… still… fine…!”\n\n\n If I give up here, they’ll never let me go to the forest. My unrelenting obsession forces me to say I’m fine, but my physical condition is anything but fine right now. My body is heavy, and I’d like nothing more than to just sit down right here.\n\n\n “You’re not fine at all! …Up we go!”\n\n\n Of his own accord, my father stops walking, turns around, and picks me up. I cling desperately to him, my breath rough and ragged as I suck in air.\n\n\n Impossible! This will kill me! My family’s absolutely correct. There’s no way I can make it to the forest.\n\n\n My father winds up carrying me in his arms for over half of the trip to the gate. When we arrive, he carries me into the night duty room so that I can rest. In all honesty, I don’t think I can do anything that isn’t taking a break. I am absolutely dead tired, so when my father lays me down on one of the benches inside, I lay there for quite some time. After noontime has come and gone, I finally am able to sit myself upright.\n\n\n “Hey, Daddy. You said Otto’s going to be teaching me how to write, but that takes a lot of time, right? Is that okay? What about his other work?”\n\n\n I’m pretty sure Otto has gatekeeping duties, and I’m pretty sure that teaching me the alphabet is not one of the usual duties of a soldier.\n\n\n “Otto’s job actually is teaching people how to write. We have new recruits coming in.”\n\n\n “New recruits?”\n\n\n “After the springtime baptism, we get about five new apprentice soldiers. It’s Otto’s job to teach them how to read and write.”\n\n\n It’s a good thing for a soldier to be able to read and write. If you can’t write down the names and titles of the people who pass through the gate, then you can’t be a gatekeeper.\n\n\n “Am I going to be learning with them?”\n\n\n “Yeah, that’s the plan. But, you’re not there as a new recruit, you’re there because you’re Otto’s assistant.”\n\n\n “Assistant?”\n\n\n Can a kid like me really be an assistant like that? This might just be me talking, but I look like I’m three years old. I don’t think anyone would believe for a second that I really was Otto’s assistant.\n\n\n “Maine, you helped Otto with his work before, right?”\n\n\n “Yeah, with the financial reports and the budget… but those were just calculations.”\n\n\n I only helped Otto out that one time. Since he looked so ashamed to have asked me for that favor, I felt like I shouldn’t tell anyone about it, not even my father. Otto, however, seems to have told him, even though that might have gotten him in trouble.\n\n\n “Ahh… I might have put too big of a burden on Otto when I asked him to do all of that work, all by himself, with nobody to help him. He suggested that you might be interested in helping him, in exchange for learning how to read and write.”\n\n\n Although I’d decided that being taught the alphabet was my reward, I actually wasn’t joking when I said I wanted to be Otto’s assistant.\n\n\n “You’re going to basically be Otto’s personal assistant, but it’s not allowed for kids who haven’t been baptized yet to have a job. So, we’re going to say that he’s really teaching you how to write, which is why you’re coming to see him at the gates. Your salary will be in slate pencils, and you’ll have time off whenever you’re not feeling well. Otto wanted to emphasize that this isn’t easy work, you’ll be helping him with budgets and more.”\n\n\n Apparently, Otto specifically asked for me so that I can learn how to write and help him out with the paperwork. Is he thinking ahead to next year’s budget season? On top of that, by going through his superiors, he was able to get my slate pencil salary officially approved from the budget instead of having to pay me out-of-pocket. As expected of a merchant! It feels like he’s working to maximize his own profits.\n\n\n “Maine,” calls Otto, “We’re about to start, are you ready?”\n\n\n “Yes!”\n\n\n I grab my tote bag and head from the night room to the training room. In one corner, a wooden table and chairs have been set up. Five boys sit there, probably the apprentice soldiers my father was talking about.\n\n\n “This is Maine, the squad leader’s daughter. She helps out with some of the paperwork here. She wants to learn how to write, so she’ll be joining us today. Don’t make a big deal out of this.”\n\n\n After giving me that kind of introduction, Otto begins his lessons. He writes out what appears to be the fundamental letters of the alphabet. Well, I haven’t memorized all of these, so it can’t be helped that this is the first step.\n\n\n “These are all of the letters of the alphabet.”\n\n\n Today, we’re practicing five out of the thirty-five letters of the alphabet, writing them out on our slates while repeating their pronunciations. Since I was already taught a little bit about some of these letters, memorizing these takes little effort at all.\n\n\n “…Maine, you really do learn things quickly,” says Otto.\n\n\n “I really like doing things like this, more than I like doing things physically,” I reply.\n\n\n Unlike the ordinary children of this world, I am already very much accustomed to studying. I also have no problem at all with studying on my own, and my memory is very good. Basically, this is something that I both like and am very good at. Placing me next to these rank beginners, clumsily sweeping their poorly-gripped pencils in amateurish strokes, makes them look even more pitiful by comparison.\n\n\n “Mister Otto,” I say, “I think we should move on to the next thing soon.”\n\n\n “Eh? Already?”\n\n\n It feels like it’s only been about thirty minutes, but it looks like the boys think that sitting still and practicing writing is torturous. They’ve started fidgeting in their seats, proof that they’ve already had enough.\n\n\n “It’s hard for someone who’s just picked up a slate for the first time to focus on one thing for so long. We’ve practiced writing, now we should do some math, then draw maps of the area around the town, then learn the things soldiers need to know. We should take breaks every once in a while to move around. If we experience a little bit of a lot of different things during the day, we’ll master them a lot better.”\n\n\n It’s probably best to think of these children as elementary schoolers. In Japan, we’d never sit down an elementary school student and force them to write _hiragana_1 over and over for an entire day. They wouldn’t be able to handle it, and the boys of this world, who aren’t accustomed to sitting still at all, would fare far worse.\n\n\n “Let’s work on calculations next,” I say. “How about we start with counting?”\n\n\n Since everyone’s been shopping before, they all know how to count up to about ten. However, there’s a few kids that don’t quite seem to get it, so we spend some time writing out the numerals from zero to five while reading them aloud. Again, the boys all start to fidget in their chairs after a while, so I wrap up the lesson and send them away to work on their physical fitness.\n\n\n “Let’s wrap up studying for today. Make sure you memorize the letters and numbers we learn today by next time. If any of you don’t have them down, you’re going to spend a lot more studying in here, alone, until you get it right. It’s very important that you learn these!”\n\n\n The children spread out through the room. I’m no longer needed in the training room, so Otto leads me back into the night duty room. He frowns at me, disapprovingly.\n\n\n “Maine, you’re being too soft,” he says. “They’ll never learn that way.”\n\n\n “Nuh-uh. If we know that learning is hard for them, and that it’ll take extra time, then it’s okay if we only teach them that much at once. Don’t compare them all to me!”\n\n\n “Ah… right…”\n\n\n Otto scratches at his face, his stubble crackling under his fingertips. It seems like he’s realized that he might have been subconsciously comparing the other children to me.\n\n\n “On top of that, if we go over it next time and they haven’t memorized it, they won’t get to go home until they do, right? So now it’s a matter of personal duty. That’s not soft at all, you know?”\n\n\n “I see! That’s actually pretty strict towards these kids that have just barely started to work.”\n\n\n A grim smile crosses Otto’s face. I smile back at him, and breathe a soft sigh.\n\n\n I never asked about helping out with teaching the new recruits as well, but if kids like that are my classmates, my own studies will get nowhere.\n\n\n Otto comes back into the night duty room, then spends the remaining time with me doing private tutoring. He teaches me how to write certain vocabulary words, then I practice them. While I’m busy, he works on his paperwork.\n\n\n “Well, Maine, it looks like you’ve got the alphabet memorized, so let’s get you started on some vocabulary. I’ll teach you some of the most common words.”\n\n\n “Okay!”\n\n\n Mr. Otto does in fact teach me vocabulary words, but a lot of the words he’s teaching me have to do with equipment or gatekeeping duties. It really does look like he has his sights set on making me help him write up official documents. If he can make me more useful, then he’s probably going to draft me into helping out with all of the paperwork come next year’s budget season.\n\n\n Some of the first words he taught me were “character reference”, “nobleman”, “letter of introduction”, and “petition”, you know? How are these “the most common words”? At the very least, if we started by learning the names of goods, I could learn words like “hay” or “foodstuffs”, and the names of kinds of weapons and armor…\n\n\n My pencil clacks against the slate as I continue to spell out words. Suddenly, my father’s voice cuts through the room, telling me that it’s almost time for the gates to close and that Tory and her friends have just returned from the forest. I put my slate back in my tote bag and run outside to meet everyone.\n\n\n “Tory!” I call, waving.\n\n\n “Let’s head home, Maine.”\n\n\n There are a few other children with Tory. They all have bags and boxes strapped to their backs, packed full of their tools and the things that they’ve gathered. A couple of them give me strange looks, eyeing my single tote bag suspiciously.\n\n\n “Eh? 'Maine’?” says one of them.\n\n\n “Is that Tory’s little sister? I’ve never seen her before.”\n\n\n I hide behind Tory, shielding myself from the impolite stares of these filthy children.\n\n\n “Maine doesn’t come outside very much,” says Tory, chuckling wryly, “so it’s only natural you wouldn’t have met her.”\n\n\n It seems like the fact that I never show my face at any of the big local events is causing these kids to treat me like they just saw a rare monster spawn. Tory tries to reassure me that they’re just curious and not trying to tease me, but their stares still hurt.\n\n\n “Maine, you’re going back with us?” asks a familiar voice.\n\n\n “Lutz!!”\n\n\n Inwardly, I breathe a huge sigh of relief, seeing Lutz’s familiar face in the group. I look around, trying to find Ralph, but there’s no sign of his red hair and strong build anywhere.\n\n\n “Huh? Is Ralph not with you today? Is he okay?”\n\n\n “Ralph turned seven this spring, so he’s working today.”\n\n\n “Ahhh…”\n\n\n Ralph was only seven? That’s what Maine’s memories seemed to say, but since he was so strong and so caring, I thought he had to actually be at least eight or nine. Huh? Is it just me, or did Lutz grow a bunch over the winter? It looks like this world still obeys the laws of heredity.\n\n\n As I’ve been carefully considering these matters, we’ve started walking. These kids have been out in the forest all day and want to get home as quickly as possible to get their heavy packs off of their backs, so they’re walking at a pretty decent pace. Tory and Lutz notice that I’m in danger of getting left behind, and call out to the group to slow down for me.\n\n\n “Hey, everyone, don’t rush!”\n\n\n “You doing okay, Maine?”\n\n\n I was planning on powering through and keeping up with them, but no matter how hard I tried the group started steadily pulling ahead. Children are merciless. There’s no way they were going to wait up for me.\n\n\n “Everyone, you’re going too fast…” says Lutz.\n\n\n “Sorry, Lutz,” says Tory. “Do you mind slowing down for Maine? I have to keep an eye on all of the kids.”\n\n\n Tory is the oldest of this group of unbaptized children, so she needs to look out for everyone in the group, not just her little sister.\n\n\n “Got it,” says Lutz. “Maine, take your time. I’ve got a lot of things I’m carrying today, so I won’t be able to carry you too if you get tired halfway through.”\n\n\n “Okay,” I reply.\n\n\n I may have been left behind, but Lutz falls back to walk with me on my way home. I don’t want to get tired and burden Lutz any further, so I slow down to conserve my energy.\n\n\n “What were you at the gate for, Maine?” he asks.\n\n\n “I was studying the alphabet,” I reply. “The alphabet? You can write?!”\n\n\n Lutz is extremely shocked by this revelation. His eyes gleam with respect as he turns to look at me, but it only makes me feel uncomfortable. I wouldn’t really describe myself as being able to write, since I only really know a few specific words.\n\n\n “I can’t really write anything but my name very well. I’m still practicing.”\n\n\n “Whoa, Maine! You can write your name?!”\n\n\n Huh? Did that somehow make him respect me more?\n\n\n I never would have thought that just being able to write your name would be so impressive. Although, now that I’m actually thinking about it, if the village elder is the only person in an entire village of peasants who can read and write, then it really is comparatively amazing that my father can write down other people’s names.\n\n\n I consider that first-grade level skill, but in this world, it’s really worthy of respect…\n\n\n I suddenly realize how precious being able to help out with paperwork is. It did seem like Otto was more interested in my upbringing than the other soldiers. If I decided that it was good enough for me to just be able to write other people’s names, there’s no way he’d be able to teach me how to write up official documents.\n\n\n “Hahh…… hahh……”\n\n\n “Maine, you okay?”\n\n\n In my case, learning how to write is the easy part. Building up my strength is what’s painful. Lutz helps me along the entire rest of the way, but by the time I make it back home, I’m so exhausted that I can’t even speak.\n\n\n As expected, I’m immediately stricken with another fever, lasting two whole days.\n\n\n “That’s why I said not to push yourself too hard!” huffs my mother, but I seem to have actually gotten a little stronger. Ordinarily, I’d be out of action for five days, but this time I was actually ready to head back out on the third day.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n After a while, I settled into a routine. I’d walk with my dad towards the gate, although I got tired about halfway through, requiring him to carry me the rest of the way. I spent the day practicing how to write and helping Otto with calculations. When the children came back from the forest, I went along with them, but would immediately lose my breath and fall behind, causing Lutz to hang back with me, worried. Then, after I got home, then I’d be out for another few days.\n\n\n This lasted for over a month, but then I definitely started to get stronger. I started with one day of going out and three days of rest, but then I got it down to two days, and then I started only resting every other day. At that point, I was still going very slowly, but I was somehow managing to make it all the way to the gate on my own. After that, I started going two, even three days in a row, still only taking a day off in between.\n\n\n When I first made it to the gates five days in a row, my family was thrilled.\n\n\n “You did it, Maine! That’s the first time you’ve made it all the way without a break,” said Tory.\n\n\n “You’ve really gotten stronger. I’m so proud of you!” said my father.\n\n\n “You should be about ready to head to the forest,” said my mother.\n\n\n Right after my family finally praised me, I was immediately hit with another fever, taking me out for another two whole days. It seems like things didn’t work quite as well as I planned.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Three months after I started going back and forth between the gates, I’m finally given permission to head into the forest. Here and there, I can see glimpses of summertime. It seems that spring is at its end."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Today is the very first day I will be heading to the forest on my own two feet. Today, I’m leaving my tote bag and slate at home. Instead, I’ve got a wooden basket on my back like everyone else (although mine is smaller), containing a shovel that I’ll be using to dig up the earth. I can’t help but think of a wooden spatula when I look at this shovel, though. To be perfectly honest, I think this spatula is going to be even less effective at actual excavation than the little plastic shovels that kids use in the sandbox. Doesn’t anyone else see this?\n\n\n As I brandish the shovel, which absolutely looks like it is going to break immediately, my father grabs me firmly by the shoulder. He turns me around to face him, and starts giving me the same lecture that he’s been constantly giving ever since we decided that I could go to the forest.\n\n\n “Maine. All you’re doing today is going to the forest, then coming back. Everyone’s going to have a lot of things to carry on their way back, and they’re going to be tired. I want you to rest up while you’re out there so that you’ll have enough energy to make it back with them by yourself. Understand?”\n\n\n “I got it!”\n\n\n My father’s face grows very serious for a moment, although I can’t tell if it’s just because of my answer itself or because any of my frustrations at being told this countless times might be starting to spill over. He turns to Tory.\n\n\n “Tory,” he says, “this might be tough, so I’m counting on you. Please talk with Lutz to make sure he knows that Maine is going to have to make it back before the gates close.”\n\n\n “Okay. Today we’ll make sure to leave early,” she replies.\n\n\n Tory already has an overflowing sense of responsibility, but when she hears my father’s request, her sense of duty burns brightly as well. Today, she seems a little more strict than usual.\n\n\n By the time we head outside, there are already other children gathered near the well, boxes and baskets strapped to their backs as well. There’s a total of eight of us, ranging from the young kids like me who haven’t really started growing up to the older kids like Tory and Fey, who are a little bit bigger and stronger. Fey leads the way with his pink hair while Tory brings up the rear. As for me, I’ll start at the front with Fey, but by the time we reach our destination I’ll have fallen more or less to the rear.\n\n\n “Alright, Maine. Let’s go! Don’t slow down, okay?”\n\n\n I may be used to walking to the gates by now, but this is my first time going all the way to the forest. Thus, Lutz will be setting the pace for me. Over the last three months while walking between the gates and my home, Lutz has been gradually been figuring out what the upper bounds of my walking speed are. It’s thanks to him that we’ll be going at a speed that’s only as fast as I can comfortably go.\n\n\n “Thanks, Lutz,” I say.\n\n\n “No, thank you, Maine, you’ve been a big help too,” he replies.\n\n\n The other day, we had to finish off the last of the leftover squeezed paru. It seems that paru, which can apparently only be harvested during the winter, go bad very quickly once the weather starts to warm up. So, in thanks for everything they’ve done for me so far, I modified the recipe for bean curd hamburgers and taught them how to make paruburgers.\n\n\n I made a sauce by boiling down a kind of fruit called a “pomay”. It looks at a glance like a yellow bell pepper, but it has a very tomato-like consistency and flavor on the inside. To finish the dish off, I melted cheese on top of it. The gentle sweetness of the paru added an unexpectedly deep flavor to the dish. I was a little shocked myself, and I made it!\n\n\n Incidentally, Lutz literally started crying earlier, and his older brothers followed suit. They seem to have been deeply moved by the fact that I managed to double the amount of delicious food that they were able to eat during the winter. Carla, their mother, thanked me from the bottom of her heart for how easy my style of cooking is on their family’s finances. Having to feed four kids must be extremely rough. Engel’s law is absolutely murderous when you’re at the low end of the scale, huh?\n\n\n “Maine, why couldn’t you have told us about paruburgers during the winter?!” Lutz complains.\n\n\n “Well, if you want to mince beef, it has to be very fresh, you know? Also, mincing meat is really difficult, and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to convince everyone to help me…”\n\n\n “Ahhh, yeah, it’s tough, but we would have done it for the sake of your cooking!”\n\n\n I completely lack the strength required to work a knife for long enough to actually mince meat, and there was no way my mother would have agreed to doing something so difficult, so until now I haven’t been able to eat anything like a hamburger. I’m very glad that Lutz and his family were able to help me, and I consider myself very lucky to have been able to enjoy paruburgers with them.\n\n\n We keep a steady pace towards the forest, chatting about cooking along the way. Talking as we walk made the long journey actually kind of enjoyable, but as soon as we hit the forest all of the fatigue catches up to me at once, crashing over me like a wave. While everyone goes off to start foraging, I sit myself down on a sizable rock and try to recover as much of my stamina as I can. As I sit on my rock, hunched over and sucking in short, ragged breaths, Lutz comes over, obviously concerned.\n\n\n He pats me on my back. “Maine, you’re going to need to get used to coming out here. Otherwise, it’ll be a big problem once Fey and Tory have their baptisms.”\n\n\n “…Why’s …that?” I gasp.\n\n\n I certainly am aware that Tory is about to get baptized. After all, she has new clothes for the occasion, and I helped make her some hairpins. I’m not, however, very clear on what all happens after the ceremony.\n\n\n “After she gets baptized, she’s going to start her apprenticeship, right? So that means that you’re going to have to come out here alone for half the week.”\n\n\n My eyes go wide as Lutz explains the situation. When Tory starts her apprenticeship, then I’m going to have far less help from her when it comes to a lot of the things I do every day.\n\n\n “Wh… what do I do? I hadn’t really considered this…”\n\n\n Maine may be weak, but her life has been quite pleasant thanks to the fact that Tory is such a dependable older sister. If Maine needed anything, she could always bother Tory for it. Without Tory there, though, I don’t think I’ll be able to live. The blood drains from my face as I quietly sit there and panic. Lutz, however, chuckles, scratching at his nose.\n\n\n “Heh heh, well, when Tory’s gone, I can help you out instead. You’re still so weak!”\n\n\n “Thanks, Lutz. I’m really glad for your help.”\n\n\n “Ah… well, I’ve got to go looking for firewood, so you should just stay here and rest up.” He adjusts his backpack, then turns to walk away. “If you can’t make it back to the city, we’ll be in big trouble, you know!”\n\n\n Lutz wanders off, heading deeper into the forest. After his footsteps have faded into the distance, I look around my surroundings to make sure that there’s nobody around, then drop to the ground, pull out my makeshift shovel, and get ready start my excavations.\n\n\n Today, my goal was to make it all the way to the forest and back without getting sick. However!! I’ve made it all the way out here, to the forest, at long last! Is it even possible for me to just go home without even trying to challenge this obstacle? Absolutely not! Dig! Dig! Dig until you can’t dig any more!\n\n\n I’m hoping to find some clay-like soil, but how far down am I going to have to dig to find it? Assuming the soil composition here is like it is back on Earth, I should be able to find some if I dig a fair ways down.\n\n\n “Hi-YAH!”\n\n\n With all of my power, I thrust my shovel deep into the soil. Unfortunately, this vaguely shovel-shaped piece of wood only manages to get about a centimeter in.\n\n\n This is solid! Uh… can I even really dig here?\n\n\n This feels like I’m trying to dig up the packed dirt beneath a well-used sports field. I had this image in my mind of a forest’s soil being a lot more moist and loose than this. I feel a little betrayed.\n\n\n Is it the really soil that’s too hard, though, or is it that this shovel is terrible? …Yeah, I’m betting it’s the shovel.\n\n\n There is a world of difference between my concept of what a shovel should look like and this thing. I wanted something made out of metal, at least, not wood! Regardless, though, it doesn’t matter if the shovel’s made of wood, or if the ground is too hard or too soft, abandoning this is just not an option. Even if progress is going to be slow, what choice do I have but to continue digging?\n\n\n Scraping, scraping, scraping, scraping…\n\n\n My wooden shovel slowly peels away the topmost layers of dirt. Unearthing my clay is going to take a lot of time, patience, and strength, and it really doesn’t look like I’m going to be able to get it done in just one day. It looks like making clay tablets is going to be some serious work. I can only pray that it will be easier than my attempt to make pseudo-papyrus.\n\n\n Scraping, scraping, scraping, scraping…\n\n\n By the time I’ve gotten maybe five centimeters deep, I hear someone’s footsteps approach from behind me.\n\n\n “What the heck are you doing, Maine?” says Lutz as he approaches, both hands full of sticks and branches. His eyes go wide as he sees me sitting on the ground, digging with my shovel. “You promised that you were going to stay put and rest if we took you with us to the forest, right?!”\n\n\n I certainly did promise that when we were leaving, but there was no way I could just sit tight when my target was finally right in front of me. I was planning on stopping before Lutz returned, but once I got started, I just couldn’t quit.\n\n\n …W, what do I do?\n\n\n I was able to fool my father with a smile and a hug, but Lutz and Tory have specifically been appointed my guardians. I won’t be able to trick them that easily. I know from experience that if I try, that would only make me look more suspicious, and they’d end up asking me even more direct questions.\n\n\n “Uh, ummm… you see, Lutz,” I stammer.\n\n\n “…I see what?”\n\n\n Lutz furrows his brow, puts his hands on his hips, and looks down at me sternly. My interrogation has begun. Well then. If I tell him the truth, he’s going to get mad at me for not thinking things through, and if I lie, then he’s going to see through it and get mad at me for lying to him. Which of these options is the least damaging?\n\n\n “I’m pretty sure that I told you that you need to be resting, so what the heck were you doing?” he demands.\n\n\n “…Um, ummm! I was digging a hole!!”\n\n\n The truth spills out of my mouth as my will crumbles under Lutz’s imposing aura.\n\n\n I’m actually pretty scared of him getting angry at me. I’m pretty dependent on him right now. If he storms off, I won’t make it back home before the gates close.\n\n\n “Yeah, I can see that. What are you digging for?”\n\n\n Even though I’d answered honestly, Lutz seems twice as angry now. He glares at me from above, his eyes cold as ice.\n\n\n “Well, um, you see… I want some ‘clay’.”\n\n\n “Huh? You want some what?”\n\n\n Lutz cocks his head to one side, unable to understand what I’m getting at. His expression grows slightly more dubious, and seemingly slightly less angry.\n\n\n “I want soil that’s really dense and solid, the kind where water doesn’t drain away.”\n\n\n “…If you wanted that, wouldn’t there be a lot more of that over there, where there’s not a lot of trees and grass?”\n\n\n If soil has bad drainage, then it’s difficult for plants to grow there. I guess it would be much more efficient to look for a place with fewer plants.\n\n\n “Thanks, Lutz!” I say, immediately standing up to leave.\n\n\n “Hey! Maine, wait!”\n\n\n Lutz reaches out and grabs me by the scruff of my neck before I can run away. He’s got both size and strength over me, so there’s no way I can escape.\n\n\n “Let me go, Lutz.”\n\n\n “Your job today is to rest, Maine. Haven’t you been listening?” he says, pulling on my ears. “This isn’t something you need to run out and get literally right now, right?”\n\n\n “Ow, ow, ow!” Flustered, I flail my arms ineffectively as I cry out. “I don’t need it to live! I just really want it, so I wasn’t going to bother anyone to help me get it!”\n\n\n Lutz lets go of my ears, and I immediately clap my hands over them, glaring up at him with teary eyes. He falters, just a little bit, although I don’t know if it’s because he can’t come up with a good rebuttal or because he’s scared of the powerful love that I show towards books despite not really being materialistic otherwise. What’s important, though, is that this is an opening that my instincts are telling me that I cannot let slip past. Now is my time to strike!\n\n\n “If you make me sit still here, are you going to go dig it up yourself?!”\n\n\n “…I’ve actually gathered my share of the firewood for today, so I can do that. So, Maine, sit there and be good.”\n\n\n I am floored by this completely unexpected reply. My jaw drops, and I can do nothing but stare blankly up at him. He should have lashed back out at me for what I just said, but… is this guy an idiot? He surely has more important things to do than helping me work on a project that he has no interest in at all. Rather than digging up clay, shouldn’t he be gathering something?\n\n\n “Lutz, um, I’m happy you want to help, but don’t you have your own things to do?”\n\n\n “Maine, you’re really weak, and there’s no way you’ll be able to dig that up, so I’ll do it for you. You can pay me back by telling me what it is you need it for and what you want to do.”\n\n\n “…Why, though?”\n\n\n “Well, if I know what you want to do with it, then I can help you avoid doing something useless. Just now, even though you knew exactly what you wanted, you were digging in the wrong place, you know?”\n\n\n Ouch, right in my weak spot.\n\n\n Even though I certainly know what it is I’m after, I don’t know the words for it in this language, I don’t know what things might look like here that are different in Japan, and I don’t have the tools that I need. There are a lot of places where I can go wrong. After that explanation, I definitely understand now how useful it would be to have Lutz’s help in this project, but I still don’t actually know what his motivation is.\n\n\n “Why do you want to help me like this?”\n\n\n “Hm? You made me parucakes when I was super, super hungry that one time, right? I decided right then that I needed to help you out in the future.”\n\n\n Huh? Just like that? That’s all it took to get him to dig up some clay for me? Wow, I shouldn’t underestimate the power of tasty food.\n\n\n To be perfectly honest, I have no idea what’s going on in Lutz’s head that makes him equate pancakes to heavy labor, but as far as I’m concerned, he’s a lifesaver. Lutz offered to help of his own volition and without any reservations, so of course I’ll accept. It’s fantastic that I have someone to entrust the heavy lifting to.\n\n\n “…Okay, I’ll leave it to you,” I say. “I’ll wait here.”\n\n\n “Okay! I just need to finish this up real quick.”\n\n\n In a flash, he gathers up his firewood and stows it away. Real quick, indeed. Then, he leads me over to where he thinks that the drainage in the soil is poor, at a somewhat low, sloping spot in the forest floor.\n\n\n “Should be around here,” he says, pulling out the shovel I had brought with me. He shoves the wooden, spatula-like implement into the earth and begins to dig.\n\n\n “Maine, you brought this shovel all the way out here. This digging thing isn’t just some impulse, is it. Were you even intending to keep your promise?”\n\n\n “Um!? W… well, uh… ummm, I finally was able to come out here, and I just couldn’t wait any longer. So I guess I did plan this…”\n\n\n His face twitching, Lutz stabs the shovel deep into the ground with all his might in a sudden outburst of emotion.\n\n\n “Craaap, I wasn’t paying enough attention. You looked like you were going to be good!”\n\n\n “Yeah, but… my daddy was paying even less attention.”\n\n\n “Your dad’s way too soft on you!”\n\n\n Lutz, fueled by his anger, tears up the earth, despite the fact that he’s using the wooden shovel I was barely able to make any progress width. Unlike the slow, steady scraping that I was doing, Lutz pounds away at the ground, gouging out chunks of the earth with every strike. This is a marvel to watch.\n\n\n Is this just the strength difference? Or is it the way he’s doing it? Is there a knack to it?\n\n\n “Huh? The color of the dirt is different down here?”\n\n\n Lutz has excavated about fifteen centimeters down to a layer where the earth is a different color.\n\n\n “Is this what you want, Maine?” he asks, holding up a small chunk of earth, which I take from him.\n\n\n It’s cool to the touch, dense, and sticky, and it changes shape as I try to mold it with my fingers. There’s no mistake, this is exactly the kind of clay I was searching for.\n\n\n “Yeah, this is it! Wow, Lutz, you’re so strong! This would have taken me forever to do.”\n\n\n “I’m definitely not as weak as you, at least,” he says, as he continues to dig out more clay.\n\n\n My eyes glitter with excitement as I start ferrying the growing pile of clay, bit by bit, over to a nearby rock. How many tablets am I going to be able to make with this, I wonder? I’m still only just thinking ahead, but I’m already starting to fall in love with these lumps of clay.\n\n\n “So, what are you going to do with this?” he asks.\n\n\n “Eheheh~, I’m going to make some 'clay tablets’.”\n\n\n “'Cleh tab-luts’?”\n\n\n “Yeah!”\n\n\n I squeeze and stretch the clay, Lutz’s effort given form, into the shape of a thin clay board. When I’ve finished stretching into shape, I pick up a thin stick from the ground, then start to write out the fairy tales that my mother back in Japan used to tell me.\n\n\n I really want to be writing this in the local language if I could, but the things Otto’s been teaching me are all the high-level vocabulary that are needed for work. I can probably write out boilerplate text for a nobleman’s title or letter of introduction by now, but I still don’t know any words that are actually useful in ordinary circumstances. For now, I’ll stick to writing in Japanese.\n\n\n “Maine, are those words you’re writing?”\n\n\n “Yeah, they are. If I record everything in a document like this, then if I forget something in the future I can read this to remember it. Documents are amazing, you know! If I write out enough of these like this, I can then collect them into a book, which is even more amazing.”\n\n\n “Ahh……”\n\n\n “Lutz, thank you so much for getting me this clay! If there’s something else you need to go gather, then you can go do that, okay? I’ll just stay here and write.”\n\n\n “Got it.”\n\n\n The story that I’m writing right now feels like it should be titled “The Shoemaker and the Elves, Alternate Universe Edition”. I try to squeeze as many characters onto each slab as I can, but in the end it takes me nearly ten tablets to finish the story.\n\n\n “Alright, I did it!”\n\n\n At the bottom of the page, I scribe the character for “the end”, visibly trembling with excitement. I spin around, throwing my hands in the air in glee.\n\n\n Clay tablets are amazing! Clay tablets are doable! Three cheers for the great ancient civilization of Mesopotamia!\n\n\n Once I get these home, I can fire them in the stove. If they don’t crack and fall apart, then they truly will be complete. I clench my writing stick tightly in my fist, then turn around to gaze upon my spread of tablets.\n\n\n “Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”\n\n\n In the next instant, my hands are clasped to the sides of my face, mouth gaping wide open, looking very much like that _The Scream_2. All of the blood drains from my face as I take in the almost unbelievable situation I see before me.\n\n\n “What’s wrong, Maine?” asks Fey, standing in front of me.\n\n\n “Y… you stepped on them! They’re all… squished!! W… waaaaaah!!”\n\n\n The first half, the entire first half, of the story that I had so carefully and painstakingly written out, has been squashed completely out of shape by the bootprints of Fey and his friends. They’re unrecognizable as tablets anymore, and of course the writing on them is completely illegible.\n\n\n “I… I just finished that… after so much work… this!” I hiccup, barely choking back my tears. “Don’t you know how much effort I’ve put in to finally make it out here?! I put so! much! time! into trying to make this absurdly frail body strong enough to do this, pushed myself through all sorts of pain, and I really thought… Aaah, I even dragged Lutz and Tory into this too, and still! I finally finished this, I finally got it done, and then what?! Is there anything in that skull of yours? Is your hair pink because your brain is stuffed full of flowers?! Idiot! Idiot idiot idiot! Waaaaaaaah!!”\n\n\n I break down crying in such a ridiculous emotional display that I, who is supposed to have the mental stability of an adult, should be ashamed of. I can’t stop sobbing, I can’t stop my tears from falling. If you put my supposed emotional maturity aside, though, this is exactly what a very distressed little girl should look like.\n\n\n Having heard me scream, Tory rushes over with wide, worried eyes. She quickly asks around to figure what the current situation is, then crouches down next to me, wrapping a comforting arm around me.\n\n\n “Maine, there’s no need to cry like that. They didn’t mean to hurt you, you know?”\n\n\n It doesn’t matter if they had ill intentions or not, that’s not going to change the fact that my tablets have been smashed into pulp. No matter what Tory says, there’s no way it can abate my resentment, my rage, over seeing the finished product that I had finally achieved smashed right in front of me.\n\n\n “No! I’ll never forgive them!”\n\n\n Tears and snot stream down my face, but I lift my head to give a terrified Fey my most threatening glare. Lutz gently pats me on the back.\n\n\n “You can make them again, right?” he says. “I’ll help, and these guys want to make up for this so they’ll help too, right?”\n\n\n “Ah, yeah!” exclaims Fey. “We’ll help. I’m really sorry.”\n\n\n Fey and his friends nod vigorously, not disagreeing with Lutz at all.\n\n\n “…Okay,” I say. “I’ll make it again.”\n\n\n I was able to make these tablets once, so I’m sure that I’m on the right path. Clay tablets are far easier to make than papyrus, and I’m satisfied with the final result.\n\n\n However, I make very sure to leave them with a warning.\n\n\n “There will not be a second time.”\n\n\n If these kids are keeping a list of people not to piss off, I’m pretty sure I just jumped to the top of it."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n My name is Gunther. I’m the lucky husband of my beautiful wife Eva and the proud father of my two adorable daughters, Tory and Maine.\n\n\n Between my two daughters, Maine is the one who looks most like Eva, but she’s going to be even more beautiful than her mother when she grows up. She’s surely one of the gods’ favorite children. Even her constant illness must be a sign of the gods’ love: they adore her so much that they keep trying to call her back.\n\n\n Maine’s the kind of girl who gets sick the instant she works herself even a little bit too hard, but after one particularly bad fever she’s started to work on pushing that limit back, bit by bit. She’s been saying and doing some strange things, but lately she’s been putting a lot of effort into trying to make herself stronger. She used to need to stop and catch her breath after only just going downstairs to leave our building, but over the course of the last three months she’s worked so hard that now she can walk all the way to the gate without taking a single break.\n\n\n She’s amazing, right? My daughter’s a real go-getter! Don’t you agree?\n\n\n On top of that, she’s very, very bright… I think. I can’t really say for sure, honestly. It’s just that, Otto has always insisted that an assistant would only drag him down whenever I’ve brought the idea up to him, but when Maine came along, he got very excited and immediately asked if she could be his assistant, so she must be very smart.\n\n\n According to him, she’s so good at math that she was able to spot calculation errors in my squad’s financial report just by looking at it, and it looks like she memorized how to write all of the words in our basic statements after just a little bit of teaching. On top of all of that, she has a very logical nature. She’s always looking at her surroundings, using her powers of observation to spot tiny little changes that she can make, always thinking about how to further her goals. It seems that Otto is convinced she’s absolutely exceptional.\n\n\n What the hell?\n\n\n I didn’t understand half of what Otto was telling me, but it’s easy to see that my daughter is so amazingly smart that she surprised even Otto.\n\n\n That’s my Maine! My amazing little girl. She truly is blessed by the gods.\n\n\n Today, Maine’s heading off to the forest for the first time! I’m on the day shift today, so I’ll be here to meet her group when she comes back. I can’t help but be worried, though.\n\n\n “Sir, please calm down,” says Otto.\n\n\n “Hm? Ah, yeah.”\n\n\n She’s gotten strong enough to walk to the gates, but is she really going to be able to make it all the way to the forest? If she struggles to make it, there, then she won’t be able to rest inside a building like she can here. She’ll be stuck outside. Earlier, I suddenly had the worst idea: what happens if her fever comes back while she’s out there in the forest?\n\n\n “Sir,” says Otto again, “we need you to do your job. Please stop staring off into space.”\n\n\n “Oh.”\n\n\n “Are you thinking that Maine isn’t going to make it?”\n\n\n “Otto, you… don’t say anything unnecessary!”\n\n\n “Then, sir, please do your job. She’ll be back in the evening, right, sir?”\n\n\n I’m still annoyed that Maine actually looks up to this impertinent man and calls him “teacher”. Well, I know for a fact that she respects me even more. Heh heh heh. After all, when I made her some knitting needles and helped her with the pin for Tory’s hair ornaments, she declared that I was the best father in the world! She was definitely not lying.\n\n\n I go about my work, my subordinates steering clear of me as I restlessly wait for Tory and her group to return. Tory has an amazing sense of responsibility, and she agreed that she’d wrap it up early today, for Maine’s sake. Maine is still very weak and still slower than the other kids, so it’s conceivable that they’d leave the forest in the afternoon.\n\n\n The afternoon. It’s obvious that they won’t have come back by now. I know that.\n\n\n The sun is starting to dip a little bit towards the horizon, but they still haven’t come back. It should be soon, right?\n\n\n The trickle of people leaving the city for the day has turned into a rush. Still no sign of her?\n\n\n “Sir,” says Otto, “your daughter promised that they would return early, so they’re going to be back here soon, is that right? So, please, sir, please stop glaring at the travelers. You’re scaring everyone.”\n\n\n The number of people entering the city to find an inn for the evening has grown, while the number of farmers leaving the city after finishing selling their grain has shrunk. Still, Tory and Maine haven’t come back yet. They should be here any minute now.\n\n\n They’re so slow! You said you would bring everyone back early, Tory! Oh no, did Maine collapse on the way back?!\n\n\n An image suddenly rushes into my mind. Maine, collapsed on the side of the road, unable to move. Tory, panicking, with no idea what to do. A feeling that I absolutely have to do something seizes hold of me.\n\n\n “Otto, watch over things here…”\n\n\n “Sir! Are you abandoning your post?! …O, over there! Isn’t that Tory over there?!”\n\n\n “Where!!”\n\n\n Otto stands on tiptoes to see over the crowd. He’s taller than I am, so he can see all the way back to the end of the line.\n\n\n “She’s right outside the gate, standing at the very end of the line with everyone else. Let’s get move the line as quickly as possible, sir.”\n\n\n “Alright, they’re here!”\n\n\n I move quickly, processing the queue of people waiting to get into the city at lightning speed so that I can get Tory and her friends in as soon as I can. Unlike just a few moments ago, people flow smoothly through the checkpoint, and very soon I can see Tory in the crowd.\n\n\n This certainly doesn’t look like she was at the end of the line! Damn you, Otto! You tricked me!\n\n\n However, I can’t see Maine anywhere nearby. I can’t believe that Tory, with her strong sense of responsibility, would just abandon her sister like that, but no matter how hard I look I can’t see Maine anywhere.\n\n\n “Tory, where’s Maine?!”\n\n\n “Lutz stayed behind, they’re still on their way. They should be back right before the gate closes, I think.”\n\n\n I immediately look off into the distance, but I can’t see Maine or Lutz anywhere. If they’re only going to barely make it back in time for the gate to close, then they can’t have left the forest early at all.\n\n\n “You promised you were going to come back here early, right? Is this what you call early?”\n\n\n “……”\n\n\n “……”\n\n\n As I scold Tory, the other kids exchange complicated expressions, as if they’re debating whether they should say something or leave it to Tory. It seems like they’ve decided to keep it to themselves.\n\n\n “Tory, what happened out―”\n\n\n She interrupts me before I can finish the question. “A bunch of things. I’ll tell you about it later, okay? We’re late, so all our moms are going to be worried, too. I want to get everyone home as soon as possible.”\n\n\n Abruptly cutting the conversation short, she starts walking off. The rest of the children follow her into the city, looking incredibly worn out.\n\n\n “What could have happened out there? Hey, Otto, what do you think?”\n\n\n “If it was anything serious, they would have asked for help, sir.”\n\n\n He may be talking like nothing could have possibly happened, but if Tory just blows off my questions and can’t even give me a simple answer about what happened, I’m going to have questions, you know? I’m going to get worried, you know? Maine! What in the hell happened out there!\n\n\n I grow more and more restless as the day drags on. Sure enough, right before we start preparing to close the gates, Lutz finally appears, Maine leaning heavily on him, face blue.\n\n\n “Maine!”\n\n\n “…Daddy… sorry.”\n\n\n Before I can ask anything, Maine mumbles out a single word of apology, then collapses into my arms. I help Lutz get remove the wicker box (with nothing but a shovel in it) from her back, then pick her up.\n\n\n “Lutz! What happened out there? Why’s she apologizing?”\n\n\n “Ahh… um, probably, because she made a promise that she didn’t mean to keep, I guess? She suddenly started digging a big hole when I had my back turned, then she spent a bunch of time making ‘cley tab-luts’, then she got super mad at Fey and the others, and then got really worked up… She’s probably going to be sick for three days.”\n\n\n Lutz rubs his temples in frustration as he tells me everything that happened. My eyes go wide with shock.\n\n\n “And you didn’t stop her?!” I snap.\n\n\n He looks up at me, resentfully. “Mister, do you really think that me and Tory didn’t try?”\n\n\n That’s right. No matter how much I want to pin the blame on him, there’s no way that both Tory and Lutz didn’t try to stop her. Those two have done a good job of taking care of Maine in the past. Lutz, especially, has spent the last three months helping Maine get home from the gate, and even though they’re the same age he looks after her like she’s his younger sister.\n\n\n “Ah… no, sorry.”\n\n\n “Don’t get mad at Tory, she really tried her best. Ah, you can probably get mad at Maine, though. I’m mad at her too. …Well,” he says, looking at Maine as she lies limp in my arms, “not really, anymore.”\n\n\n It feels like Maine’s fever is steadily starting to rise, bit by bit. Her face had been completely pale, but now it’s getting redder and redder.\n\n\n “Take care of Maine, okay?” he says. “I got to catch up with Fey and go home too.”\n\n\n “Yeah, will do. Thanks for keeping an eye on her for me.”\n\n\n As Lutz runs off, I bring Maine into the night duty room and gently lay her down on the bench. Her face is bright red now, and her breathing comes in short, ragged gasps. This bench will have to be a good enough place to rest for now.\n\n\n I finish up my work as quickly as I possibly can, then carry Maine all the way home.\n\n\n “Welcome home, Gunther,” says Eva. “Did Maine collapse again?”\n\n\n From her complete lack of surprise, it seems like she expected that this was going to happen. Swiftly, she gets Maine changed out of her outdoor clothes and gets her tucked into bed. I sit down with Tory in the kitchen, hoping to hear her side of the story.\n\n\n “What happened out there today, Tory?” I ask. “I heard a little about it from Lutz, but I want you to tell me about it too.”\n\n\n Tory flinches in her chair, a frightened expression on her face as she hears that I already know about what happened. For someone like Tory with such a powerful sense of responsibility, being scolded for a major mistake is one of the most terrifying things out there. To put her mind at ease, I reiterate what Lutz told me.\n\n\n “Lutz told me that he didn’t want me to get angry at you. I heard that you did your best out there. He also said that I should really be getting mad at Maine, so, could you tell me what happened?”\n\n\n Now that I’ve told her that I’m not mad, Tory’s look of terror starts to gradually fade away. Her eyes flicker back and forth as she tries to get the words together in her head, then she slowly opens her mouth to speak.\n\n\n “To be honest, I really don’t know all that much. When we made it to the forest, Maine was about as tired as she usually is, so she sat down on a rock to take a break. Me and Lutz went off to do our gathering. I wanted to finish up quickly, so I thought that I had to hurry, and…” She trails off, worry building on her face again.\n\n\n “It’s okay, I’m with you so far” I say. It’s easy enough for me to see what happened when they first arrived.\n\n\n “So I thought to myself, 'it’s probably time to go soon’, but right when I was gathering everything up I heard Maine start screaming. I ran over there as fast as I could, and I saw Maine really, really angry, so angry that she was crying. Fey and his friends apparently destroyed something that she had finally been able to make? She was so mad that I couldn’t calm her down at all, and she kept saying things like 'I’ll never forgive you’, and… Eventually Lutz said something about helping her make everything again, and then she finally started calming down.”\n\n\n I close my eyes, trying to piece together Tory’s messy explanation. I try to imagine what it would have looked like if I had been there with them.\n\n\n …I don’t get it. Maine was making something, and Fey broke it, so then she threw a tantrum?\n\n\n “What was Maine making?”\n\n\n “I don’t know, exactly. I think I heard her call it a 'cley tab-lut’, but… Everyone stopped to help her make them again, so that’s why we were so late.”\n\n\n I still don’t really understand what exactly happened, but I do know one thing.\n\n\n “So, what you’re saying is that Maine broke her promise to do nothing but rest once she got to the forest?”\n\n\n “Huh… um… probably…”\n\n\n Maine didn’t keep her promise to sit still and arbitrarily went off to make something. That thing got broken, so she got everyone else caught up in making it again, so they spent too long out there before coming back, so she collapsed, so now her fever’s back. There are limits to how much of a bother someone can be, even if they’re Maine.\n\n\n “I’m not going to let her go to the forest again,” I say.\n\n\n “What?! No! She’ll be so mad!”\n\n\n For some reason, Tory with me disagrees vigorously. It doesn’t matter if Maine gets angry, though. I’m the one who should be angry, since she made a promise to me and then broke it.\n\n\n “It’s only fair. I can’t let a girl who doesn’t keep her promises go off to the forest.”\n\n\n I’m going to have to be very strict with her. I can’t let her go out only with other kids if she’s going to ignore all the rules for doing so and break the promises she makes for her parents’ peace of mind. It’s too dangerous.\n\n\n I stand up and start heading towards the bedroom so that I can have a talk with Maine herself, but Tory grabs onto my arm and won’t let go. She seems desperate to stop me. I feel bad for her, since she’s just trying to look out for her little sister, but I absolutely have to have a talk with Maine.\n\n\n “Dad, please! Think about it again!”\n\n\n “My mind’s made up. I won’t let her go out there again! If she doesn’t keep her promises, there’s nothing else I can do.”\n\n\n Maine looks up at me as I enter the bedroom, although I don’t know if she heard me. Her face is red with fever and her eyes are watery, but she still opens her mouth to speak, though it looks quite painful.\n\n\n “…Daddy, just one more time. …I’m making 'clay tablets’.”\n\n\n However, what came out of her mouth was not at all what I expected. She isn’t apologizing, she isn’t reflecting on what she has done, she’s making demands! For some reason, she still wants to go to the forest and keep making something or other. For an instant, I lose my temper.\n\n\n “What are you thinking?!” I roar. “Absolutely not!”\n\n\n Maine gives a little sigh, then turns her head to look at Tory, standing next to me.\n\n\n “…Hey, Tory. …I’ll make them at home, so…”\n\n\n “G… got it! I’ll bring them home with me next time.”\n\n\n Wait a minute, Tory. Why are you just accepting this like it’s the obvious next step?! Maine, what the hell do you think you’re going to be doing in my house?! Also, are you just ignoring how angry I am?!\n\n\n I spin to face Tory. “You’re talking about the thing that made Maine collapse? Like hell I’ll let you bring that into my house!”\n\n\n As soon as the words leave my mouth, Maine’s eyes narrow to slits, her expression growing unbelievably cold. Like the flip of a switch, the atmosphere in the room suddenly goes icy.\n\n\n A strange shimmer of color, like the surface of an oil slick, dances across the gold of her eyes, but it must just be my imagination.\n\n\n “…Are you serious, Daddy?” she says, quietly, and the incredible pressure of her words sends a shiver down my spine. I take a step back, unintentionally, shocked by the raw intimidation that my own daughter is putting out.\n\n\n “Ab… absolutely serious!”\n\n\n “I see…”\n\n\n Maine looks away, like she’s suddenly lost all interest in me.\n\n\n “Well then… I’m just going to have to do to Fey what he did to my 'tablets’, then… heh heh…”\n\n\n A cruel smile spreads across her face, that strange color still shimmering in her eyes. I shiver, again. I feel like I’m drowning in this strange atmosphere, and my breath catches in my throat.\n\n\n “…Maine?” I say. She starts to chuckle, a dark, terrifying sound.\n\n\n Tory goes completely pale, like she’s seen a monster. “Dad!” she says, shaking my arm, “just say she can go back to the forest!!”\n\n\n “…Maine,” I say again, “what are you thinking about?”\n\n\n “Hm~mm? …Well, I was thinking of how I was going to make it so that Fey can’t go to the forest either. …How, indeed?… …'Psychological trauma’…? …So, 'Bancho Sarayashiki’, then…? …Oh, or maybe 'The Ring’?”\n\n\n (Note: A Japanese ghost story about broken promises.)\n\n\n Her words are broken and nonsensical, delirious from her fever, but her head keeps moving and she keeps mumbling things out, bit by bit. I can’t really hear it very well, but it almost sounds like there’s a dark, gloomy echo underneath her words. It must be my imagination. Her voice must be a little cracked from the fever.\n\n\n My little daughter can’t be this scary.\n\n\n “…Why are you talking about Fey, now?” I ask. “He doesn’t have anything to do with this.”\n\n\n “Oh, but he does,” she says, drawing in a slow, painful breath. “…But I understand what you’re saying. …Truly, I understand.” She nods slightly, several times.\n\n\n I might have gotten a little swept away in the strangeness of the moment, but if Maine understands what I was saying, then everything’s okay. She’s very bright, so I’m sure she understands what she did wrong.\n\n\n “Ah, okay, if you’re reflecting on your actions, then―”\n\n\n “I will make them cry. …Well, I’m going to sleep.”\n\n\n “Maine, wait! You didn’t understand at all! Why did you just say that?!”\n\n\n If she really understood me, then where the hell did “I will make them cry” come from?! Make who cry?! Me?! I don’t understand her at all! You’re nearly bringing me to tears, Maine!\n\n\n “You’re noisy. …Get out.”\n\n\n “I’m your father! Do not make me angrier than I already am!”\n\n\n Tory pulls hard on my arm, dragging me back into the kitchen. I’ve been ejected from my own bedroom by my two daughters.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Tory, that was Maine in there, right?”\n\n\n “I think that was Angriest Maine. Her eyes were sparkling kind of weirdly. When Fey broke her 'cley tab-luts’, she got so mad that she started crying, and the same thing happened. Everyone said it was really scary.”\n\n\n Ahh, if even I got a little bit scared after that, it must have been absolutely terrifying for those kids.\n\n\n “She only started to cheer up when we were helping her fix things, so when it was time to go, I couldn’t make myself say it…”\n\n\n “I see.”\n\n\n If she was putting out that much pressure, I don’t blame her. Right now, even I really just want to leave her alone.\n\n\n “When it looked like we’d just barely make it back to the gates before they closed, I begged her to go. Lutz helped, and when he said we’d definitely finish it next time, we finally got her to stop working. Then everyone promised to help her finish it next time, and she said that she’d come back with us.”\n\n\n “……”\n\n\n I understand now what Tory was getting at when she tried to stop me just a little while ago. If she had only managed to calm Maine down by telling her that they’d finish up next time, then of course she wouldn’t want me to go in there and tell her that she can never go back.\n\n\n “Dad, can you let her go just one more time? I think that Fey and the others are really scared of what’s going to happen if she gets mad again. Didn’t she say that she was going to do to Fey what he did to her 'cley tab-luts’?”\n\n\n “What happened to those, anyway?”\n\n\n I still don’t understand what a 'cley tab-lut’ is. What the hell kind of thing is it?\n\n\n “Fey and his friends stepped on them and squashed them, so what’s she going to do to them? Is she going to trample them flat?! She said she was going to make sure they couldn’t go to the forest again either, what did that mean? She said she was absolutely going to make them cry! What is she going to do? What is Fey going to do?!”\n\n\n The blood drains from my face as I listen to Tory. Hearing everything Maine had said again is only making me more scared. I wonder, no, I need to know what Maine is planning to do. Is… is my daughter about to start committing crimes?\n\n\n “Tory, what can we do to stop her?”\n\n\n “I don’t know. Try asking Lutz. He was the one who got her to calm down when we were in the forest.”\n\n\n The next day, I pull Lutz to the side as he passes through the gates on his way to the forest and ask him what Maine could have meant. Tory was probably just scared and blew things out of proportion, it’s probably not actually that big of a deal, right?\n\n\n However, Lutz smashes my tiny bit of hope with a cheerful answer.\n\n\n “A~ah,” he says, in a light tone of voice, “she got super mad at Fey and the others, after all. You absolutely can’t stop her when her eyes get like that, you know.”\n\n\n “Uh?”\n\n\n “If she finds even the tiniest chance, she latches onto it like a magic beast. She’ll get whatever she wants to get done, done. She’s the kind of girl who absolutely finishes her goals. No matter what she has to do, no matter how long it takes.”\n\n\n His eyes glimmer with pride and his chest is puffed up, and he talks like he’s enthusing about how awesome Maine is. But, wait a bit, think about this for a second. If a person like that decided that they wanted to hurt someone, that would make them a supremely dangerous individual, right? And why is Lutz acting so proud of her? She’s my daughter, you know?\n\n\n “Like, say, these 'cley tab-luts’. She wanted to go to the forest, so she spent three whole months getting strong enough to get there. She said all of that was so she could make those 'cley tab-lut’ things. So, I think that she’s definitely the kind of person who’ll never give up on what they’ve set their mind to.”\n\n\n “…Those 'cley tab-luts’ were that important to her, huh…”\n\n\n I had no idea that she’d put that much effort into making those things. It looks like it’s not such a simple thing to just ban her from finishing them. Just when I decide that I should probably talk to her about it again, Lutz drops another bombshell.\n\n\n “A~ah, you know, after she finally made her 'cley tab-luts’ only to see them smashed in front of her, and then running out of time before she could finish remaking them, and then getting sick and collapsing on her way back, and then being told that she can’t go back to the forest and that she can’t have any clay in the house either… She’s going to blame it all on Fey, for stepping on them in the first place. I really hope they come out of this alive.”\n\n\n “Don’t say something so terrifying! Are you saying I’ve raised a criminal?!”\n\n\n She said she was going to make them cry, not kill them. It’s okay!! …At least, that’s what I want to tell myself.\n\n\n “Eh? Well, maybe you really did, Mister Gunther?”\n\n\n “Huh? I did?”\n\n\n “Well, you banned her from going to the forest and making her 'cley tab-luts’, right? Me, I’m terrified of what might happen if she goes at it with all of her might. I wouldn’t dare try to help or hinder her, and I’d never, ever tell her she couldn’t do something.”\n\n\n “Terrified?”\n\n\n I blink my eyes repeatedly, trying to process what he’s telling me. No matter how I look at it, Maine is only six years old, though she’s so little she looks like she’s three or four. She’s sickly, frail, short, weak, and slow. I can’t help but think that Maine using all of her strength to do something isn’t actually all that much of a problem. Lutz, though, shrugs his shoulders, continuing to describe why he thinks she’s so scary.\n\n\n “Because, you know, Maine thinks differently than I do. I don’t know what she’s going to do, where, or how. She might be so weak that I wouldn’t take her seriously if she came at me with a weapon, but that’s not something she’d ever do. I don’t know how, but she’d find and attack their weak points directly, and that’s really terrifying.”\n\n\n I groan to myself. Lutz is being completely serious here. I hadn’t really thought that what Maine meant by all of her might might have been different than what Lutz or I would mean. I’m scared that I don’t even know how serious she’s going to be. That lack of understanding alone is terrifying.\n\n\n “A while ago, she even beat my big brother Zeke, like to the point where he was seriously begging her to stop. She told me that strength isn’t everything, and lately, I’ve been beating my big brothers too, sometimes.”\n\n\n Wait a minute! This is the first I’m hearing about this! How could she possibly beat Zeke? And we’re talking about beating as in “winning”, right?! What has my daughter been doing?!\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz,” I say. “This is a completely honest question: how would you stop Maine from being so angry, if you were in my shoes?”\n\n\n “Hmmm, I think that I’d find a lot of clay and pile it up in front of her. She seems absolutely fixated on nothing but her 'cley tab-luts’.”\n\n\n Now that Lutz has described the situation to me, I know what I have to do. In order to preserve the safety of this town and keep my youngest daughter from a life of crime, I’m going to, begrudgingly, have to let her go back to the forest.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n When I tell her this, though, she looks very dissatisfied, puffing out her cheeks in frustration.\n\n\n “…And I’d come up with all of these really good plaaans… and it would be a waste to just let them go, right?”\n\n\n “Not at all!! Throw whatever schemes you’re plotting out of your head right this very instant!”\n\n\n “Tsk…”\n\n\n It seems like she dreamed up some sort of plans to squash Fey flat while caught in her feverish nightmares. I don’t know if it’s because she’s a little too smart, or just far too angry, but I feel like this was a very close call.\n\n\n For now, I’ve stopped Maine from committing any crimes. Fey and the others won’t have to face her wrath, and I’ve protected the peace of this town. I’m very, truly grateful that Lutz told me how I could calm her down.\n\n\n I breathe a sigh of relief, having put everything back in order, then suddenly gasp as I come to a realization.\n\n\n Huh? Didn’t all this start because she needed to think twice about breaking promises?"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n While wracked by feverish nightmare, I dreamed up ways to bury Fey and his lackeys in the icy grip of terror.\n\n\n I was so close! I was so close to finally having a book! But, if I can’t go to the forest, and if I can’t have any clay brought back to me, then I’ll never get my book.\n\n\n It would seem that this calls for the most traumatic of ideas: classic Japanese horror. I have no solid idea about what the denizens of this world are truly afraid of, but if I let my hair hang down in front of my face like Sadako, wear a stained, tattered dress, and stumble towards them while whispering dark curses… or maybe I could count my missing clay tablets like Okiku from Bancho Sarayashiki… How about that? That’s scary, right?\n\n\n (Note: The specter from The Ring.)\n\n\n (Note: A classic Japanese ghost story. Okiku, the vengeful spirit in the story, is obsessed with finding the missing plate from her collection, which was lost and/or broken through treachery.)\n\n\n Even though I had come up with so many good ideas, by the time my fever went down, my father had changed his mind. When I’m finally healthy enough to get out of bed, he tells me that he’s lifted the ban on my going to the forest.\n\n\n “…Tomorrow,” he says, with a complicated expression on his face.\n\n\n “Hm?” I reply, looking up at him.\n\n\n “You can go back to the forest tomorrow.”\n\n\n “Huh? I can? Why?”\n\n\n “…You don’t seem happy.”\n\n\n I actually really am happy that I can go back to the forest, but this means all of my Japanese horror plans are for naught. I’d been practicing mumbling curses, thinking about how to make my clothes look properly ghastly, and coming up with the perfect times and places to really set the stage for the whole spectacle. I could have stood on the edge of the well, or I could have shuffled out of a dark alleyway…\n\n\n “I mean, I’m happy, but…”\n\n\n “But, what?”\n\n\n “…And I’d come up with all of these really good plaaans… and it would be a waste to just let them go, right?”\n\n\n “Not at all!! Throw whatever schemes you’re plotting out of your head right this very instant!”\n\n\n “Tsk…“\n\n\n Well, if I can go to the forest and finish working on my tablets, then my plans aren’t really necessary. In fact, it would ultimately be more wasteful to actually go through with them. I no longer have the free time to play around with Fey and the others, so it’s obvious that those plans are just going to be automatically discarded.\n\n\n Nevertheless, what on earth happened to make him change his mind so suddenly?\n\n\n \"I’ve been keeping an eye on how you’re doing, and I think you can go tomorrow. But no sooner!”\n\n\n It seems that he didn’t want me to go because suddenly taking off for the forest while I was still convalescing would have been a terrible idea. I already knew that, though. Nobody in the world knows better than me what a pile of junk this body is.\n\n\n Today, my fever went down and I was given permission to go back to the forest. My heart dances with joy as I work on preparing everything I’ll need for tomorrow. In the storage room, I find some sort of board that I might be able to use as a writing desk, and put it in my basket. (What that board is supposed to be used for, I don’t know.) Then, I grab the entire pile of old rags that my mother uses as cleaning cloths and stuff them in there too. I’ll use those to wrap my tablets in for transport on the way home.\n\n\n Clay tablets! Clay tablets clay tablets clay tablets I’m coming for yooou!!\n\n\n The next day, I wake up energized and excited, only to be greeted by heavy rain. Not just any heavy rain, even, but a torrential, record-breaking downpour, a storm so fierce that it’s practically a typhoon. Even though the shutters on our window are closed, I can still hear the howling of the wind and the pounding of the rain.\n\n\n “Noooooooo!! Rain?!”\n\n\n In a world without weather forecasts, thinking about the weather had never even occurred to me. There’s been many times where I haven’t been able to go outside because my fever was too high or because my family didn’t say it was okay, but until now I was never kept indoors by bad weather.\n\n\n Visions flash through my head of my tablets, pounded by the rain until they’re nothing but mud. Even though I had hidden them from the elements under some bushes, that’s nowhere close to being adequate protection against a typhoon like this.\n\n\n Ngyaaaaah! My tablets…! They’re turning to droopy mush!!\n\n\n “Hey, Maine, wait!” yells my mother as I immediately, unthinkingly, dash for the door. She grabs both of my arms and holds them behind me, stopping me in place. “Where do you think you’re going?!”\n\n\n “The forest!” I yell, struggling against her grip.\n\n\n “Even on the best of days you get fevers far too quickly, so why would you think that going outside in the middle of a storm like this is a good idea?!”\n\n\n The sound of the wind and the rain pounding ceaselessly at the wooden door reverberates through the house. Just from the noise, it’s obvious that this is an extremely violent storm. An ordinary person would hesitate before trying to go out in this, even if it’s just to the well, so there’s no chance in hell that I’ll be able to make it outside at all. Heartbroken, I sit down abruptly, like a puppet with its strings cut.\n\n\n “My ‘clay tablets’… waaah!”\n\n\n “It’s okay, Maine,” says Tory, coming over to comfort me. “Everyone said that they’re going to help you this time, so it’ll be even quicker and easier than before to make them.”\n\n\n She gently strokes my head as she reassures me that everything’s going to be okay. She really is an amazing older sister.\n\n\n The storm is so unusually bad that it lasts for two full days before clearing up, so it isn’t until after that that the children got permission to go back out to the forest.\n\n\n The morning sun shines brightly down from an astoundingly clear sky, and the faces of all of these children that can finally go to the forest shine brightly as well. Today, the apprentices aren’t working, so a lot of the bigger kids have joined us as well. We have far more people coming with us today than usual. Ralph, one of Lutz’s older brothers, is joining us today. He has an enormous basket strapped on his back, and a bow and a quiver full of arrows hanging at his side.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine!” he says, cheerfully. “Is your fever doing any better?”\n\n\n “Good morning, Ralph,” I reply. “I got better a little while ago, but as soon as my dad said I was okay to go that awful storm hit.”\n\n\n “That really is awful,” he says.\n\n\n He ruffles my hair, then turns to Tory.\n\n\n “Hey, Tory,” he says.\n\n\n “Ralph! It’s been a while,” she replies.\n\n\n Ralph, looking remarkably more reliable than he did before, maybe because he’s been working on his apprenticeship.\n\n\n Tory, whom I have been carefully polishing in preparation for her baptism, and her radiant smile.\n\n\n Hey, hey. Don’t these two look really good together? They’re both really good at taking care of people too, they’re a great match.\n\n\n As I leer at the two of them, Lutz grabs my arm and starts yanking me forward.\n\n\n “Whoa?!”\n\n\n “Maine, stop staring off into space. You’re the slowest person here, so you’ve got to be in front when we leave, okay?”\n\n\n “Oh! Sorry.”\n\n\n I join the mass of children, and we all start walking towards the forest. As we pass through the gate, the green, open fields stretch out before us. The scars left by the storm can be seen here and there, where a few of the fields of crops have been torn to shreds.\n\n\n Come to think of it, does this world have anything like disaster relief?\n\n\n I stare blankly off into the distance, my feet moving mechanically beneath me. Lutz sticks his hand in front of my face and waves it back and forth.\n\n\n “Eh?” I say, blinking. “What’s up?”\n\n\n “Oh, I just was wondering if you were actually watching where you were going. Hey, Maine, you’re going to try making those things again, today? Those 'cley tab-luts’? What are those, anyway?”\n\n\n Lutz can’t read, so he couldn’t have any idea what I’ve been trying to write down, even if I wasn’t writing in Japanese. More importantly, though, he’s been living a life without written words or even paper at all in his house. He absolutely has no idea about the amazing wonders of permanent media like clay tablets.\n\n\n I suddenly feel a strange sense of purpose; a desire to proselytize, to spread the good word of the written word.\n\n\n “Well, so,” I begin, “it’s a thing that I can use to write down things that I don’t want to forget. If you carefully write everything down, you’ll never forget it, you know, because since you’ve written it down you can always go back and look at it again, right? 'Media’ exist for that reason, and my 'clay tablets’ are one kind of 'medium’. Since it’s made out of clay, and since you can knead and mold clay, if you make a mistake when writing, you can use your finger to smooth it out again and start over. You can bake it when you’re done, if you want it to last forever. It’s amazing, right?”\n\n\n I don’t know if it’s because of the eloquence of my explanation, but Lutz has his mouth hanging open, head tilted to one side.\n\n\n “…I don’t get it. …Anyway, what are you trying to write?”\n\n\n “A story, I’m writing a story. It’s one that Mommy told me, so I want to write it down so that I don’t forget it, you know? What I really want are books, but I can’t get any of those here, so I’m making my own.”\n\n\n “Ahhh, so is that what you’ve been trying to do?”\n\n\n Lutz’s question suddenly makes me think. Right now, I don’t have even a single book available to me, so I decided that I needed to somehow make my own. What I really, truly want, though, is not making books.\n\n\n “Nuh-uh, it’s a little different. What I really want is to live a life where I’m surrounded by books. No matter many books are written every month, I want to have all of them, and I want to be able to grow old spending all of my time reading.”\n\n\n “Ummm, so… you want books…?”\n\n\n “Yes!! I want them very badly, and I want them right now. But they’re so expensive that I can’t buy them, so they’re way out of my reach. I’ve got no choice but to make them myself, right? Paper is too expensive to buy, so my plan is to make clay tablets, write a story, and then bake it so that I can have it forever.”\n\n\n At this point, Lutz claps his hands together, and a moment of understanding flashes across his face.\n\n\n “So, what you’re doing is making a substitute for a book?”\n\n\n “Yeah! I’ve failed a lot of times so far, so this time I’m absolutely going to make this a big success.”\n\n\n “Ah! Okay, I’ll help out too.”\n\n\n For whatever reason, Lutz has become so cooperative because I had some ideas about cooking. I kind of want to help him out a little, too.\n\n\n “So, Lutz, what do you want to do? You’ve heard what I want to do, but do you have anything that you really want to do?”\n\n\n “I… hmm! I want to try going to other towns. If I become a trader or a minstrel, then I could go a lot of places, and hear a lot of stories, right? There’s a lot out there I want to see.”\n\n\n “That sounds nice…”\n\n\n Come to think of it, back in Japan, I also used to dream of spending my life traveling to the great libraries of foreign countries and reading all of their books. As visions of my unfulfilled dreams unfold in my head, my gaze drifts off into the distance.\n\n\n “…You really think so?” he asks. “About wanting to leave this town?”\n\n\n “A~ah, traveling is good too! Traveling around, going here and there, that sounds fun. I always used to dream about traveling, visiting all sorts of 'libraries’ all over 'the world’…”\n\n\n “Ah, I was worried you’d think I was being ridiculous. …If it’s something you want to do, Maine, I’m sure you’re going to make it happen.”\n\n\n “You too, Lutz. I think you can do it if you try.”\n\n\n My mind is so crammed full of the countless dreams I had back when I was Urano that I’m far too preoccupied to notice whatever expression Lutz is wearing on his face right now.\n\n\n By the time we arrive at the forest, the packed dirt of the road has almost finally dried. We quickly pick a large clearing on the edge of the forest as a good meeting spot.\n\n\n “Okay, let’s get started gathering,” says one of the older children. “Little kids, don’t go too far from here. Make sure you can always see this clearing, okay?”\n\n\n The older kids take out their bows and arrows, and take off deeper in the forest. The younger kids hesitate, glancing nervously at me. I may be exhausted just from walking all the way here, but I immediately start looking around the area, worried about the state of my clay tablets.\n\n\n “Hey, does anyone remember where we put my 'clay tablets’?”\n\n\n I can’t find the tree we put a mark on the last time we were here. It’s already been quite a few days since I was here last, so I’ve already forgotten, but everyone’s looking around restlessly, troubled looks on their faces.\n\n\n “We marked a tree somewhere over there, right?” says Fey, pointing off into a distance. Immediately, all of his lackeys start nodding. I had a hunch that that direction was where we needed to be looking, but the storm had knocked down so many trees that it was hard to be sure.\n\n\n “That’s about where it was, so I guess we just need to start looking around there,” says Lutz, bending down to start looking through some of the bushes. Everyone else starts bustling about together, searching here and there.\n\n\n It’s not just Fey and his lackeys, everyone is helping search… wow, these are all some really good kids, aren’t they?\n\n\n “Hey,” says Fey, squatting down low beside a bush. “Isn’t this it?”\n\n\n Our landmark had been broken apart, so it had been difficult to find, but Fey waves his hand at me, beckoning me over. I rush over with every scrap of speed I can muster to take a look. All I see is a misshapen lump of earth, with vague hints of ruined, illegible characters. Just as I expected, it’s all soggy and muddy, and you can’t really even make out that there were words carved into them at all. My tablets have returned to being just lumps of clay.\n\n\n Ah… back to square one again…\n\n\n “It… it wasn’t my fault this time! I found them like this!” exclaims Fey, hurriedly.\n\n\n “…Yeah,” I reply, though it’s obvious what happened even if he didn’t say anything.\n\n\n I know that it’s not his fault. I know that everyone around me is asking what’s going on or wondering what they should do. I know that this is something that I had known was going to happen. Still, I can’t stop the tears streaming down my face.\n\n\n As tiny sobs leak out of me despite my better efforts, I hear footsteps come up behind me. They come up right beside me, and a hand is placed lightly on my head.\n\n\n “Maine,” says Lutz, “if you’ve got enough time to cry about it, you should use that to make some new ones instead.”\n\n\n His words snap me back to reality. That’s right, it’s just like he says. I’m finally back out here, with Fey and his friends here to help me rebuild them. I sniff, wiping the snot from my nose off with my sleeve, and lift my head.\n\n\n As if I’d give up here!\n\n\n My first defeat was under the boots of Fey and his disastrous lackeys. My second defeat was at the hands of time, cutting me off with the closing of the gates. My third defeat was by the howling storm.\n\n\n I have fought through man-made calamity and natural disaster! There can’t possibly be anything left that can stop me now. I am going to complete these tablets at any cost.\n\n\n It may be the case that my clay has turned into a shapeless blob, but I can knead and mold it back into flat tablets again. If I don’t have enough, then I remember where I can go to get more. This isn’t square one. Square one was when I was scratching at the dirt with my blunted wooden shovel, fruitlessly searching for clay in the wrong spot. This is way different.\n\n\n Everything’s going to be fine.\n\n\n What I’ve learned from my mistakes so far is that I either need to finish these in a single day while the weather is still clear, or relocate to someplace with a roof, otherwise this whole thing is futile. We’ve been blessed by beautiful skies today, and I have three strong, healthy helpers on top of Lutz and Fey to assist me. Whether it’s because my tears and rage were effective at guilting them into helping, or whether they’re just really eager, I don’t know. Either way, with even more people helping me out then there were before, it’s definitely going to take far less time to finish.\n\n\n “It’s okay, Tory,” I say, “you can go work on gathering. I’ve got Lutz, Fey, and the others helping me.”\n\n\n “Got it. …Good luck, everyone!”\n\n\n “Yeah!”\n\n\n Tory’s encouragement helps me pull myself back together, and I get started on once again remaking my clay tablets. Fey and one of his lackeys work on digging out more clay from the ground, then the other two lackeys work with Lutz to knead the clay and form it into the right shape for me. As for me, I’ve found a slender twig and am carefully carving my story into the surface of the first tablet.\n\n\n Yeah, yeah! I’m feeling great about this!\n\n\n “I’m going to need about ten 'clay tablets’ to finish writing my story,” I say, “so once you’ve made ten of them, go do your gathering work. Thanks!”\n\n\n “O… okay!”\n\n\n One after another, clay tablets are quickly dug up, molded, and lined up next to me. After swiftly finishing ten of them, Fey and the others don’t hesitate to race off into the forest.\n\n\n Lutz, however, stays behind, and starts digging up more clay.\n\n\n “Lutz, you’re not going with them?”\n\n\n “Ralph’s here today, so I’m going to stay here and help you!”\n\n\n “Hmm! Well, I’ve already got enough clay, so do you want to practice writing?”\n\n\n On a patch of dirt still soft from the rain, I use my stick to write out “Lutz” in the local alphabet.\n\n\n “What’s that?” he asks.\n\n\n “That’s your name! If you can’t even write your own name, you won’t be able to go visit other towns, you know?”\n\n\n Our town basically allows us to walk freely in and out of the gates because they know who we are, but if we try to go to other towns, they’ll ask us for our names and want them written down. That’s what Otto, a former trader, told me. At our gates, the entry lines for people from other towns are actually separate from those for people from our town, and the checks are much more strict for outsiders. If Lutz wants to travel to other towns someday, he should at least know how to write his own name.\n\n\n “So, this is how you write my name?”\n\n\n “Yeah! You know, if you want to travel around, it’s a really good idea to learn how to write.”\n\n\n His eyes gleaming, Lutz practices writing his name on the ground over and over. Meanwhile, I continue diligently working on finishing my clay tablets. Carefully, I carve the first story I ever heard in this world into the tablets, in Japanese. With every stroke of my stick, I tell myself that I’m absolutely going to finish my book.\n\n\n “It’s done!!”\n\n\n I’ve finished writing out one of the fairy tales my mother told me. Right now, I want to write an anthology, titled something like “Tales My Mother Told Me”, filled with all of the bedtime stories that my mother packed into my head ever since I was reborn into this world.\n\n\n I carefully wrap each of my tablets in the old rags I brought with me. I stack them in my basket, taking great care to move them as slowly as possible so that I didn’t risk smudging the words written on them into illegibility.\n\n\n When I finally have all of them stacked neatly in my basket, I heave an enormous sigh. My eyes grow hot, and tears shimmer on their surface.\n\n\n This is my first real triumph! To be honest, clay tablets aren’t the kind of medium that most people would think of when they’re talking about books, but, no matter what anyone says, this is the first book I’ve finally acquired in this new world.\n\n\n It was at the end of autumn that I was reborn into this world, and now we’re approaching the end of spring. It has taken a tremendous amount of time, but I have finally acquired my first book.\n\n\n “Even in a world like this, I can still read a book,” I whisper to myself. “…So, everything’s going to be okay.”\n\n\n I was reborn into a world where books are far too expensive for poor people to buy, into the body of a child that can hardly do anything without being stricken with fever. I was fine with doing something reckless, and maybe even dying for it. I’d never once imagined that I’d have the body of such a frail little girl. I’d never even considered that I’d be forced to live out my life in a world without books. I didn’t even have a fragment of attachment to this new life.\n\n\n However, I finally have a book in my grasp. I’ve finally accomplished the one thing that I truly wanted to do. Now, I have something to live for. Now, I can truly see myself living in this world.\n\n\n “Maine, you finished it?” asks Tory, returning to the clearing with her pack full.\n\n\n “Yeah! I’m finished. Thanks to you, and Lutz.”\n\n\n The emotions I’m feeling for Tory and Lutz may be those that Maine felt for them, and not mine, but making this book has truly saved me.\n\n\n I carefully lift the topmost cloth and show the two of them the finished tablet.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine,” asks Tory, “What did you write on this one?”\n\n\n “Oh, this is the story of the children from the stars. It’s the story that Mommy told me on my first night.”\n\n\n “…Your first night?” she asks, a dubious frown on her face.\n\n\n “Yeah, this is the first story I can remember.”\n\n\n This is the story that my mother quietly recited to me on that first night, when my fever was so painfully high that I couldn’t sleep. Her voice may have been full of love and affection, but it was an affection for someone who was not me. Her words and emotions were things I couldn’t accept, so they passed right through me, and the feelings of isolation within my disconnected mind only grew deeper.\n\n\n Despite this, as soon as I decided that I was going to make a book in this world, I immediately knew what it was going to be about. If I capture her bedtime stories in my precious, first book, then I feel like I might truly be able to accept her love.\n\n\n “I don’t want to forget her story at all, so I made sure to write all of it out here so that it’ll never go away.”\n\n\n Tory smiles, seeming a little bit anxious. “But, it can still be erased, right?”\n\n\n “If I leave them like this, yeah, but when I bake them, they’ll get hard, and then you can’t erase them anymore. Then, once I do that, I can always read Mommy’s stories.”\n\n\n It’s been almost half a year since I started living here, but this is the first time I’ve ever had an honest, genuine smile.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n …This would be an excellent happy note to end my story on, but it does not, of course, end here.\n\n\n As soon as I returned home, I baked my tablets in our oven. They exploded. No, really. They exploded. I don’t know what you’re trying to tell me, but I’m not lying.\n\n\n While they were baking in the oven, there was a boom, and the first book I had ever written flew out of the oven in a cloud of dust and chunks of dirt.\n\n\n I didn’t even have the time to investigate why. First, I was too dumbfounded to ask, then my mother scolded me for quite some time, then she made me promise that I wasn’t going to do anything like that again.\n\n\n Huh? Doesn’t this mean that I’m actually, completely back to square one now? Ah, wait, no, it still feels like I actually finished something, so… three steps forward, two steps back, maybe?\n\n\n …What the hell do I try next?"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Ahh… if only I could have successfully baked my clay tablets. That would have been great. I never even imagined that they might explode.\n\n\n If I had a knife like Tory’s, then at least I might be able to make mokkan.\n\n\n (Note: Mokkan are thin, narrow wooden tablets that were used for keeping records in historical Japan. The Japanese term is what’s used in academic literature on the subject, so I’m leaving it as-is.)\n\n\n After that tiny little explosion in the stove, I was forever banned from trying to make clay tablets again. I’d completely run out of book-making plans, so I was only left to ponder what my next method could possibly be. In the meantime, Tory turned seven years old.\n\n\n Here, it’s customary for your seventh birthday to be an enormous celebration. More accurately, it’s not the precise birthday that’s being celebrated, but instead the season in which you were born. Every season, there is a large baptismal ceremony at the temple, where every child who has turned seven gather to be baptized. Afterwards, the children are able to start working as apprentices, and it seems like that’s when they start getting counted as part of the town’s population.\n\n\n For whatever reason, it makes me feel kind of weird to think about religious ceremonies, but if I think of it like _Shichi-Go-San_, then it doesn’t bother me at all. Strange.\n\n\n (Note: A Japanese festival for seven, five, and three-year olds, which is generally considered a kind of coming-of-age ceremony. The name literally translates to “seven-five-three”.)\n\n\n Children under the age of seven aren’t allowed to enter the temple, so my father and I aren’t participating. Incidentally, while I already knew for a while that I wasn’t going to be able to attend, my father’s absence was forced on him abruptly. Due to some twist of unfortunate luck, he has been summoned for a meeting that he absolutely cannot get out of, on the very day of his oldest child’s baptism. On top of that, this is a meeting convened by some very high-ranking members of the aristocracy, so if he didn’t attend, his superiors might have his head. Literally.\n\n\n Scary!\n\n\n Despite that, my father has been sitting here since early morning, issuing complaint after complaint, seemingly in no hurry to actually head out for work.\n\n\n “No… I don’t want to go to this stupid meeting! It’s Tory’s baptism, you know? Why’d someone have to schedule this pointless meeting on this really important day?”\n\n\n It’s very true that today is an important day. I’m sure that aristocrats have children too, so if they also go to get baptized then they should have been well aware of exactly when the ceremony is supposed to take place.\n\n\n “Huh?” I say, puzzled. “Do the nobles not baptize their kids like we do?”\n\n\n “…They don’t go to the temple to do it, they call the priests out to their houses. So, they don’t understand how we feel in the lower classes.”\n\n\n Last night, I was able to ignore him, since I figured it was better for him to get his complaints off his chest while he was still at home, but this man is obstinate. Perhaps it’s a trait common to fathers in every world who love their daughters that they feel this anguished and depressed whenever they miss their daughter’s track meet or recital?\n\n\n I sigh as I carefully comb Tory’s long hair out to the sides. “Daddy, we can all go out together, so you need to get ready to go to work! You can walk Tory to the temple, you know. Anyway, only the kids can enter the temple today, so you’d just be waiting in the courtyard, right?”\n\n\n I think he’ll cheer up a little bit if he can lead Tory to the temple and see her standing in line, all dressed up in her beautiful new clothes. Even though I’ve offered him a good suggestion, he still continues to ramble meaninglessly.\n\n\n “But it’s a father’s duty to wait in the courtyard…”\n\n\n “I thought it was a father’s duty to go to work for their family, though?”\n\n\n “Ngh!”\n\n\n “Is going to work with me really so awful? You’re going to go alone, then!”\n\n\n I push him away, acting like I’ve lost all ability to care. He turns to me with pleading eyes brimming with tears, seemingly about to start crying at any moment.\n\n\n “…No, I’ll go with you. As soon as the meeting’s over, we’ll come back, because everyone’s going to be celebrating tonight…”\n\n\n Tory looks over at our father and smiles brilliantly, keeping her head as still as she can so that I can continue weaving her hair.\n\n\n “Hey, Dad. I get it, already! You’re going to come back and celebrate with us, right? I’m really looking forward to it, so come back soon, okay?”\n\n\n “…Yeah!”\n\n\n With a single sweet smile, my father’s mood suddenly skyrockets. I mentally applaud Tory’s results. You truly are our angel, Tory.\n\n\n “Maine,” she says, “keep an eye on Dad to make sure he gets his work done today.”\n\n\n “Leave it to me! I’ll do my best, so you don’t need to worry about that all on your baptism day!”\n\n\n “Hey, Maine!” objects my father. Tory starts laughing out loud.\n\n\n Yeah, that’s a great smile. It seems like Tory won’t be lonely, even if our father can’t come to her baptism ceremony, since she’s so appreciative of our father’s oppressive love.\n\n\n “All done,” I say. “…Yeah, Tory, you’re super cute.”\n\n\n “Thanks, Maine.”\n\n\n I’ve combed her hair out, separating it to either side, then braided some of the hair on each side back into a half-up style, which I then finished off with her hairpin. The hairpin is something that I made this past winter, using the same colors of thread that were used in the embroidery on Tory’s dress to make a bouquet of tiny lace flowers. The multicolored flowers on the pins match Tory perfectly, giving her a cheerful yet sweet sort of air.\n\n\n “Well, Tory,” says my mother as she walks into the room, “You’re looking very beautiful.”\n\n\n “Huh… Mom?”\n\n\n My mother has dressed up for today, since she’ll be going to the temple with Tory. She’s wearing her only nice dress, a simple, pale-blue affair whose hem falls all the way down to her ankles, just barely letting you see her shoes. I never thought that she could become so beautiful just by changing her clothes and scrubbing away the red stains from crushing seeds at the dyery.\n\n\n My mother’s got some raw potential underneath all that. She’s seriously beautiful.\n\n\n “Mommy, come sit over here,” I say.\n\n\n “I’m fine as I am,” she replies. “The way you do up hair is very beautiful, Maine, but also very extravagant. I don’t want to draw any attention to myself today; it’s the children who should be playing the leading roles.”\n\n\n “Ahh, okay.”\n\n\n It’s not like I can really use any ornaments, so I personally wouldn’t think that my hairstyling is particularly extravagant, but if my mother says so I guess it must be true. I don’t really know what counts as dressing up around here, but it’s definitely possible that I could overdo it.\n\n\n I hop down from the chair I’d been standing on as I worked on Tory’s hair. “So, let’s go!”\n\n\n I grab my tote bag with the things I’ll need to take with me to the gate, then head out the door with my dressed-up sister. My mother, Tory’s chaperone for the day, follows close behind, accompanied by my father, dressed in his work clothes.\n\n\n Typically, my mother walks at a very brisk pace, even when carrying a lot of things, but today she steadily, carefully climbs down the stairway, holding the hem of her dress up so that it doesn’t drag as she walks. Tory hitches up her skirt a little bit as well, mimicking our mother, taking the stairway one steady step at a time. Since I’m in my usual clothing, I don’t care at all, and I actually manage to make it to the bottom of the stairs a step ahead of everyone else.\n\n\n “Whoa…”\n\n\n A great many people are milling about outside in the plaza around the water well. It seems like everyone’s showing up to congratulate the children who are heading off to their baptisms. I can see Ralph and Lutz in the crowd, despite the fact that I’m pretty sure they have nothing to do with today’s ceremony. Everyone seems to be here to give their well wishes to today’s stars.\n\n\n I’m sure there were still ceremonies in the winter and the spring, but back then I really didn’t have much strength to leave the house very often, so this is the first time I’m seeing all of this first-hand.\n\n\n “Fey, congratulations,”\n\n\n “You’re looking pretty manly!”\n\n\n It seems like pink-haired Fey is having his baptism today as well. Similar to Tory, he’s wearing a white outfit with an embroidered sash. His sash is green, though, and looped around his shoulder.\n\n\n …Ah, I see. Being able to sew really is important.\n\n\n Since everything around here is hand-made, relative differences in your skills can have a very noticeable effect. In Japan, being good at sewing was really never particularly useful, and everyone here always wears beat-up rags, so even though my mother had told me that being good at sewing was an important skill for a beautiful woman to have, it never really clicked with me until now.\n\n\n I didn’t have anything to compare my mother’s sewing skill to, but now that I’m seeing the other kids’ clothes, she really is amazing at it. Enough to brag about it, even. As for me, it’s becoming clear that it won’t be at all possible for me to find a lover, let alone get married.\n\n\n “Ahh, Tory! You’re amazingly cute!” cries Carla, her voice booming through the plaza and her hands clapped to the sides of her face as she praises Tory. Everyone’s attention is immediately drawn to Tory, and they start heaping congratulations on her.\n\n\n “Congratulations, Tory!”\n\n\n “Your hair is so beautiful, just like a nobleman’s daughter!”\n\n\n Carla continues to lavish praise on Tory, who gives her an embarrassed smile in return. Unlike all of the other children, Tory’s hair cuticles are very healthy, so her blue-green hair is glossy. Between the white dress my mother is so proud of and the halo of light reflecting off of her hair, she looks positively angelic.\n\n\n My Tory really is an angel. I think I can understand why my dad dotes on her so much.\n\n\n “Maine worked really hard to braid my hair,” she says.\n\n\n “Huh, she did?” asks Carla. “I guess she has another redeeming feature beyond her unusual recipe ideas.”\n\n\n Carla, you’re so mean. I breathe a sigh of relief, though: there’s at least one thing that this worlds think that I’m good for.\n\n\n “This is really complicated. How did you do it up like that?”\n\n\n “Let me see, let me see!”\n\n\n Regardless of age, an army of women has formed around us, trying to get a good look at Tory’s head.\n\n\n Eeeek! This is a really standard hairdo, you don’t need to stare so closely! You people don’t comb your hair our properly, so of course it gets messy when you try to braid it…\n\n\n “That looks great, Tory!” says one of the younger girls in the crowd, sighing enviously. “I want to do my hair like yours for my baptism this winter.” The crowd around her agrees emphatically, murmuring “me too, me too” in unending waves of sycophancy.\n\n\n “So everyone wants to Maine to do their hair too?” asks Tory with a delighted smile. She turns to me. “Will you?” I immediately shake my head in refusal. “There’s no way!”\n\n\n “Why not?” she says, taken aback a little.\n\n\n “I don’t know when my fever’s going to come up again. You know that this is the first time I could actually go to a baptism, right?”\n\n\n I feel a little bad for Tory, since all she wanted to do was brag about her little sister, but there’s no way I could braid the hair of a bunch of unknown girls every single time a baptismal ceremony came around. On top of that, I can guarantee that it won’t turn out even close to how Tory’s looks right now. These girls’ hair is like Tory’s was at the start of all this; rough, unwashed, and in dire need of repair. While I had to touch damaged hair like that when I was just starting out, by now I absolutely do not want to have to feel anything like that again.\n\n\n “Ah, okay. You’ve been doing a little better lately, but your fever really does still come back unexpectedly. I was just trying to boast a little about my little sister, that’s all.”\n\n\n I’m trying to give off the impression that I really want to agree to Tory’s offer despite the fact that I’m such a fundamentally useless burden. Honestly, though, doing that would be psychologically impossible for me.\n\n\n “…I can still show everyone else how to do their hair like I did yours. I just don’t want to promise everyone that I’ll do it for them, that’s all.”\n\n\n “Yeah, yeah, like Dad was just telling you the other day, don’t make promises you can’t keep. Hey everyone, Maine said that she can show everyone how to do their hair like mine!”\n\n\n Tory seems satisfied with the compromise I came up with for her suggestion, so it seems that the plaza in front of the water well is going to become a hairdressing classroom at some point in the future.\n\n\n I never would have thought, even for a second, that braided hair could draw this much attention. No wonder my mother didn’t want me to do hers as well.\n\n\n “Hey,” says one of the girls, “what about that hairpin? Who made that?”\n\n\n “Maine!” replies Tory. “Nuh-uh,” I say, “the whole family did! Me and Mommy made the flowers, and Daddy made the pin part of it.”\n\n\n “Ahh, that’s right,” she says.\n\n\n My mother, who is very skilled at sewing, didn’t know about lacework. It seems that it really is very rare to see it here. All of the older woman immediately pounce on me.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine. Do you think you could teach me how to do that?”\n\n\n “Showing you how is easy, but if you don’t have really tiny needles you can’t do it, you know? Also, I think it might be better for Mommy to show you how to make it, she’s way better at it.”\n\n\n I’m already bad at talking to strangers. On top of that, there’s a good chance that I might say something really weird, since I lack a lot of the common knowledge people around here should know. As a result, I really don’t know what I should be saying to these women. I think the best way to interact with my neighbors is probably to keep them at arm’s reach.\n\n\n Da-dong, da-donnng ring the bells of the temple. Whenever the bells in the center of the temple ring, the sound echoes throughout the entire town. In an instant, every flapping mouth in the plaza snaps shut. In the next instant, someone in the crowd yells out, “Time to go, people! To the main street!!”\n\n\n With the children to be baptized leading the way, we head out towards the main street in groups. At the same time, other groups of children appear from the other alleyways here and there, followed by more groups of spectators. From the edges of the town to the gates of the temple, the procession gathers in the main streets, with the children in their white clothes at the head and their chaperones close behind. The rest of the people line the sides of the streets, seeing their children off as they join the crowd.\n\n\n This scene really reminds me of, well, you know.\n\n\n People, cheering and waving, are lined up by the sides of the road while a procession makes its way through the streets. Even if you can’t see where the procession is, you can hear the roar of the crowd swell as it grows closer to you. It really reminds me of the New Year Ekiden.\n\n\n (Note: The New Year Ekiden is a long-distance relay race held every New Year between teams from major Japanese corporations.)\n\n\n Starting from far away, I hear the cheering gradually grow closer and closer. When the procession is almost right on top of us, I glance over at Tory. She seems nervous, standing there with a stiff expression on her face. I reach up with my index finger, standing on my tiptoes as high as I can go, and poke her in the cheek.\n\n\n “Huh?” she says, her eyes going wide. “What was that for?”\n\n\n “Smile, Tory! You’re the cutest girl in the whole world when you’re smiling. It’s true, you know!”\n\n\n After a moment, her wide eyes slowly crinkle up as her usual radiant smile spreads across her face.\n\n\n “Ugh, come on, Maine,” she says, in mock exasperation.\n\n\n “Hey now,” says my father, “even when she’s not smiling she’s the cutest girl around.”\n\n\n What do I do about this man?\n\n\n As we banter back and forth, the procession comes into view. Loud cheers, applause, and whistles fill the street around me as countless children, dressed in white, parade down the street towards the temple. Some of them are beaming, some have stiff expressions, some walk proudly, and some look very nervous.\n\n\n Tory and Fey each take a step forward, leaving the crowds of spectators lined up on the side of the streets. They lightly walk towards the stream of children as they pass by, joining the line of children at the very end. Once we see that they’ve made it into the line, Fey’s family and my family both step forward to join the procession as well.\n\n\n At every bend in the main street, another few children join the crowd. At this rate, I don’t even have the slightest idea how many we’ll have by the time we finally get to the temple at the center of town.\n\n\n Even though we’re still just walking towards the temple, there’s already some parents that are so deeply moved that they’ve burst into tears. Such as my father.\n\n\n I follow the procession through the thunderous cheers, halfway jogging to try and keep up. Voices ring out from everywhere around me, so I curiously look around the area as best as I can. People watch us from the windows of the houses that line both sides of the street, some of them throwing tiny white flowers from some unknown plant down on us as some kind of blessing. The flowers thrown from the highest windows drift down gently, almost seeming like they’re falling straight from the clear blue skies. The children at the front of the procession start laughing excitedly. I can’t see much through the crowd, since I’m far shorter than everyone else around me, but I can see the hands of the children reaching up towards the sky, perhaps to try to catch the flowers as they fall.\n\n\n At the large fountain that sits in the middle of the intersections between two main streets, the procession comes to a brief stop. Another group of children, who followed a different path to get here, meets up with ours, and the crowd starts to swell. This is as far as my father and I can go.\n\n\n “Daddy, come on, this way,” I say, pulling on his hand. It seems like he’s intent on following the procession all the way to the temple, but I grab tightly onto his hand and try to lead him away. I drag him out of the way of the procession to the side of the streets where the sight-seers are standing, and we join them in seeing off the procession as they resume their path towards the temple.\n\n\n “Tory…” sobs my father, gazing forlornly off in the direction of the temple.\n\n\n “Ugh! Daddy, come on!”\n\n\n Now that the procession has passed, the crowd of people is starting to thin out as people head back to their homes. I turn us around to follow the crowd, heading back in the direction of the south gate. My father, however, keeps stopping to look back to where the procession has gone, lingering regret in his eyes, leaving me wondering if we’re going to actually make it to his meeting on time.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Squad Leader! You’re late!” says Otto, glaring angrily at my father as we finally reach the gate. Otto quickly ushers him into the meeting room, leaving me, as usual, to sit down and practice writing on my slate.\n\n\n It looks like, starting today, I’m going to be learning the names of the goods on the wagons that come in and out of the town, so that I can eventually read the merchants’ cargo manifests. These words are actually the first words I’ve learned from Otto that are actually usable in daily life. Today, all of the words that I’m learning are the names of vegetables that are in season.\n\n\n There’s a lot of vegetables that I know about already, like “pomay” (the tomato that looks like a yellow pepper), “vel” (a kind of red lettuce), “foosha” (a green eggplant), and so on. Since I know about these, they’re easy for me to remember, but there’s also a lot of them that I haven’t actually seen on our dinner table. Those will take some more time to memorize.\n\n\n I really want to head over to the market so that I can match these names to what they look like… but I don’t think I can stomach another encounter with the butchers’ shops.\n\n\n As I sit there, alone, slate pencil clacking on slate, one of the younger-looking soldiers bursts into the room, holding some sort of document.\n\n\n “Do you know where Otto is?” he asks.\n\n\n “I think he’s in a meeting today.” I reply.\n\n\n “Ah, that’s right! Now what do I do…”\n\n\n It looks like today’s gatekeeper isn’t particularly good at reading official documents.\n\n\n “Want me to read it for you?” I ask, holding out my hand.\n\n\n “Huh? You?” he asks, looking at me with an incredibly dubious expression on his face.\n\n\n “I can try; I am Otto’s assistant.”\n\n\n I can understand his skepticism; after all, I look like a little girl, not the kind of person you’d expect to be able to read important paperwork. I’m used to seeing that expression by now. I really only offered out of the goodness of my heart, so if he doesn’t want to take me up on my offer I don’t particularly care either way.\n\n\n He doesn’t react at all to my offer, so after a few seconds I turn my attention back to my slate and continue practicing writing out characters.\n\n\n “…You can read it?” he asks after a brief pause.\n\n\n My confidence in my reading ability actually depends a lot on what kind of document it is. I can’t yet say that I’ve memorized everything.\n\n\n “Umm, if it’s a letter of character reference or a aristocratic introduction letter then I can read it. If it’s a merchant’s cargo manifest then I can read the numbers but not all of the words.”\n\n\n “Ah, well, this is an introduction letter. Could you please?”\n\n\n These aristocratic introduction letters are written in an unnecessarily overcomplicated style, making them a huge bother to read, but once you clear past all of the flowery language the meat of the document is actually very simple. All you really need to know is who is referring whom to whom, and whose seal is needed on the document.\n\n\n I unroll the document, taking a deep breath of the smell of parchment and ink, then scan my skillful eye over the text within.\n\n\n …Ahh, the leading private is in a meeting right now. This is a lower-ranking nobleman’s introduction, so it’ll be fine to make him wait until the meeting’s over, right?\n\n\n “Umm, this is a letter of introduction from Baron Bron, and the bearer is going to see Baron Glatz. This needs the leading private’s seal.” (Note: “Leading Private” is a military rank. In the US Army, the equivalent rank it Private First Class.)\n\n\n I hand the document back to the soldier, trying to remember how Otto did his job. If I’ve got the interaction manual in my head right, I can at least do things like this.\n\n\n “Please ask the merchant who brought this letter to wait in the waiting room for lower-ranked nobility. Today’s meeting was called by a high-ranking nobleman, so they’ll have to wait until the meeting is over before the leading private can apply his seal. If you explain this properly, I don’t think the Baron’s guest will be unreasonable.”\n\n\n “Thanks. You’re a lifesaver!”\n\n\n He salutes me, tapping his chest twice with an upturned fist. I hop down off of my chair, face him, and return his salute. As Otto’s assistant, it’s only natural for me to be able to do these kinds of things.\n\n\n Hmmm, at this rate, I’m going to wind up finding work as whatever equivalent this place has to a clerk, it seems…\n\n\n I’d been thinking that I’d have figured out how to make paper before I started my apprenticeship next year so that I could start a bookstore, but things aren’t really turning out like how I envisioned. Reality is pretty crushing, sometimes.\n\n\n I continue practicing writing out words on my slate for a long time before my father, finished with his meeting, suddenly bursts into the room.\n\n\n “We’re leaving, Maine!” he says.\n\n\n “Ah, a little wh―” I start to say.\n\n\n “Let’s talk while we’re walking,” he interjects, cutting me off. “Tory is waiting!”\n\n\n My father stuffs my slate and pencil into my tote bag, picks me up piggyback, and starts walking briskly home.\n\n\n “Daddy?! Um! I have to repo―”\n\n\n “Let’s get out of here before Otto catches us.”\n\n\n “Wait!! I have to give Mister Otto a report!”\n\n\n As we quarrel, Otto catches up with us.\n\n\n “Oh! Mister Otto! A merchant is here, with a letter of introduction from Baron Bron to Baron Glatz. The leading private was in the meeting, so I had him wait in the lower-ranked nobility waiting room. Please take care of him quickly!”\n\n\n “As expected of my assistant! Great job, Maine.”\n\n\n “She’s my daughter.”\n\n\n Otto sighs and rubs his temples in response. “I’d only entrust such an important task to such an excellent assistant,” he says to me. “This squad leader here should go home immediately. Thanks to his constant fidgeting during the meeting, the high-ranking noblemen there were glaring at me! I think I lost years off of my life.”\n\n\n “Daddy, life is important,” I say.\n\n\n “Look, you heard it from Otto too: we’re heading home.”\n\n\n His heart is absolutely set on returning home immediately, so he carries me all the way home as quickly as he can.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n In the evening, we throw Tory a birthday party. My image of a proper party involves cake as a very crucial element, but we don’t have anything like that in this house. So, after taking a look at our ingredients, I decided that I’d make some pseudo-french toast.\n\n\n I took a loaf of hard multi-grain bread and had my mother cut it into thick slices, then took advantage of the fact that Lutz’s family really appreciated my recipes to get some eggs and milk from them. My mother finished everything off by frying each slice in butter. We don’t have sugar, honey, or anything like that, so I garnished it with a bit of jam made from some sort of raspberry-like berry.\n\n\n I was able to do one more thing for Tory: I cut up the vegetables in the soup into cute shapes, like hearts and stars. She seemed very pleased by this.\n\n\n “Here, Tory,” says my father, “we have a present for you.”\n\n\n “Whoa… Dad, Mom, thanks!”\n\n\n They’ve given her new work clothes, as well as the tools she’ll need for her job. Now that she’s seven years old and has had her baptism, she’ll be starting her apprenticeship. While there are some live-in jobs available, Tory’s work as a seamstress will not be one of them, so she’ll be commuting back and forth.\n\n\n Aha, she has her sights set on getting good at sewing and becoming a beautiful woman. She wants Ralph to call her a good girl. I understand completely.\n\n\n “You’re not working every day, right?” I ask.\n\n\n “Well, when I’m just starting out, I’m not going to be able to do all that much, so I’ll only be there about half the week.”\n\n\n “If they spend every day teaching apprentices, then they’ll never get anything done, after all,” explains my mother.\n\n\n Certainly. I’ve experienced that first hand: on days when the apprentice soldiers have to be taught writing and math, I don’t get any of my own studying done, and Otto’s work only piles up further.\n\n\n “And now this is for you, Maine.”\n\n\n With a heavy clunk, my parents place a long, thin object, wrapped in cloth on the table in front of me. I blink my eyes, doubtfully tilting my head to one side. It wasn’t my baptism today, so I’m not sure why I would be getting a present as well.\n\n\n “But it wasn’t my baptism today?”\n\n\n “Since Tory’s going to be going to work, you’ll be in charge of going out and collecting firewood. You’ll be needing this.”\n\n\n I unwrap the cloth, revealing a knife, dully gleaming in the candlelight. Its blade is thick, and when I heft it in my hands I can feel its considerable weight. In Japan, it would be unconscionable to give something so dangerously sharp to a young child, but common sense here dictates that a child that doesn’t have something like this can’t even defend herself, a baby that can’t help out or do anything useful.\n\n\n They really gave me a knife.\n\n\n Up until now, they’ve really been totally treating me like a baby. Tory was assisting the family, but I was only Tory’s assistant. Or, would it be more accurate to say that I was a burden that only did unnecessary things? However, now that Tory is starting her apprenticeship, it seems like I too must start to carry the proverbial knife.\n\n\n But, now I’ve got a knife! I can make mokkan!\n\n\n I’m going to make mokkan!!"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Today is the first day of Tory’s new apprenticeship, and I have been seriously panicking. The responsibilities that have been thrust on me are things that I’m almost surely incapable of actually doing. I was thinking that I could use all of my modern-day knowledge to make up for my other deficiencies, but none of that knowledge is actually the slightest bit applicable.\n\n\n Tory was seriously amazing as an older sister.\n\n\n First of all, I can’t fetch water. I can’t even pull it up from the well! I lack the necessary strength. On top of that, even though I can only draw up a little to begin with, hauling it up the stairs is extremely difficult as well. If I wanted to get a single bucket’s worth of water up to my home, I need to make five trips. Our household, however, doesn’t need just one bucket of water. I need to fill up our entire jug. When my mother helps me fetch the water, she manages to fill the jug in about the same amount of time it takes me to fill just one bucket.\n\n\n I’m useless.\n\n\n When it comes time to start preparing lunch, I need to light the fire in the stove. When I was still in school, we went on class camping trips, so I know how to stack logs for making a fire. You stack the fat fuel logs with the slender, easier-to-burn kindling in a way that air can easily pass through, then use some sort of tinder, like dry grass, that catches sparks and burns hot and quick. That, I can do.\n\n\n However, I can’t actually light the fire. When I went camping, we had lighters. Here, we have flint, which I have no idea how to use at all. I watched Tory do it once, then later tried to mimic what she did.\n\n\n “Wha–?!”\n\n\n When I struck the two chunks of flint against each other as hard as I could, sparks flew out, as could be expected. The flash of glittering sparks right before my eyes caused me to flinch back in shock, dropping both stones to the floor. Ever since then, I’ve been afraid that those sparks might burn me like the sparks from fireworks, so I haven’t been able to muster up the courage to strike them together hard enough to spark. Eventually, my mother wound up doing it.\n\n\n I’m really useless.\n\n\n If it’s helping out with cooking prep work, I can do at least that… or so I thought. However, the kitchen knife is so heavy that I have to use both hands to lift it. Plus, when I look at the trussed-up birds we need to prepare, I freeze up. All I can really do is chop up the ingredients that I can use a smaller knife on and provide recipe ideas. There’s very little else I can actually do in the kitchen. I’m so short that I can’t even stir things around in a frying pan, even if I’m given a stool to stand on. My mother really does praise me on my recipes, but my lackluster contributions only serve to make me increasingly depressed.\n\n\n I’m seriously useless.\n\n\n Tory arrives home from her first day at work to find me sitting in the corner, a dull, depressed look on my face. “What’s wrong, Maine?” she asks.\n\n\n I’m too depressed to even answer, so my mother does so for me. “…She tried to help out today, but couldn’t do very much at all. I think she’s depressed about how little she could actually do.”\n\n\n “Huh? Now?”\n\n\n Yes, Tory, now. It may have taken some time, but I finally realized it. I am completely worthless.\n\n\n “…I tried to do so many different things, but I couldn’t do any of them at all,” I mumble.\n\n\n “Well, we know what your condition is,” says my mother reassuringly, “so as long as you’re trying your best it’ll be alright, right?”\n\n\n “Also, there’s nobody better at cleaning than Maine!”\n\n\n I have some experience pushing a broom and wiping things down; those are things that I can manage to do even if I only barely have the strength to do it. If I put too much power into it, though, my fever comes back immediately. Also, my constant cleaning efforts are not done because I want to help the family out. I’m doing it because I absolutely cannot stand living in such a filthy environment. It’s for my own sake, not my family’s.\n\n\n In modern Japan, where we have machines to do all of the heavy work for us, I could clean, do laundry, and cook from start to finish, all by myself. Here, however, I can’t do any of that at all. Honestly, I didn’t think that it would be anywhere near this hard. Tory’s only a year older than me and she can do it with no problems. I, however, am stuck with this inexplicably weak body, and am just dead weight.\n\n\n When I somehow got reincarnated, I really would have preferred a much more robust physique. At least, robust enough to not be a hindrance.\n\n\n “Ahaha, Maine,” laughs my father, “are you bothered that much by being useless?”\n\n\n “…Yeah, I am.”\n\n\n “Well, even if that’s the case… I never really had any high hopes to begin with.”\n\n\n “Uh?”\n\n\n Huh? Why is he saying something so unexpectedly cruel? Why is he smiling?\n\n\n “Well, I think it’s a bad thing that you keep collapsing as if you’re about to die. I think you’ve done more than enough already to make yourself stronger.”\n\n\n Tory is the one to shrug her shoulders at that. “I think what you’re saying is right,” she says, “but at this rate nobody’s ever going to hire her, right? She can’t do anything at all.”\n\n\n My father shakes his head. “Not at all, she can work at the gate!”\n\n\n “Huh? What can she do there?”\n\n\n Tory and my mother both look at my father in bewilderment. Why they’re bewildered, I have no idea.\n\n\n Have they just been not paying any attention at all when I’ve been telling them what I do all day at the gate? Or did they just not believe me at all?\n\n\n “What can she do? Paperwork, of course! Even now, when she goes to the gate she does some work as Otto’s little assistant. …More than half the time, he’s teaching her how to write, though.”\n\n\n “Really?! I thought she was just going there to take breaks!”\n\n\n “I thought she had to have been making up all of those ridiculous stories!”\n\n\n Tory, why are you acting so surprise? Also, mother, that’s mean! Their excessively honest reactions feel like a stab in the gut.\n\n\n “She’s especially suited for work that involves a lot of calculations. If she wanted, after her baptism she could work at the gates officially. How about it, Maine? Want to come work with your daddy?”\n\n\n “Huh? Nuh-uh. I’m going to run a ‘bookstore’ or be a 'librarian’.”\n\n\n Unfortunately, I have zero ambition to follow my father to work every day in order to do the gatekeepers’ paperwork. However, this is a world that hasn’t yet seen bookstores or libraries, so of course everyone looks at me doubtfully, not understanding what I said at all.\n\n\n “…Aaahh, Maine. What are those?”\n\n\n “Someone who sells books… so, a merchant, I guess? Hmmm, maybe being a merchant isn’t quite right for me, but I’m going to do a job that involves a lot of books.”\n\n\n “Well, I don’t really get what you’re saying, but I think that it’s great if you can do the things you want to do. For now, doing the things you can do is just fine. Half a year ago, you couldn’t walk to the forest at all. You could barely even go outside! Now, you can go in and out of the house as much as you want on your own.”\n\n\n “…Yeah.”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Today, I was told that I needed to go out and do my best to gather some firewood, so I strapped a wicker basket to my back and went with Tory off to the forest. It’s true that I can indeed walk all the way to the forest, just like my family said, but by the time I get there, I need to take a long rest, and if I’m not very careful about how much I move around I might need to spend the entire next day in bed.\n\n\n I really hate this feeble body.\n\n\n When we got to the forest, I took a break to catch my breath, then I got up and started to help search for firewood. All I’m doing is looking around for branches that have fallen off already, but Tory actively searches for low-hanging branches, then hacks at them with a knife that’s like a small machete. They break off with a creak and a snap!\n\n\n “Wow, Tory really is amazing…” I say aloud, once again impressed by Tory’s raw competency. “I’ve got to keep working hard too, doing whatever I can.”\n\n\n I redouble my efforts, working until I run out of breath. I sit down on a nearby rock to take a break. Without wasting any time, I pull out my knife, intending to start make mokkan.\n\n\n “Whoa, this is really heavy,” I sigh, feeling the weight of the dully gleaming blade in my hands. Knives aren’t something that I have literally zero familiarity with. In Japan, I used kitchen knives and box cutters in my day-to-day life.\n\n\n However, I have basically no experience with whittling. What little I do have comes from elementary school, where we had a lesson on sharpening our pencils with little blades. At the time, however, I decided that using a pencil sharpener was good enough for me and barely paid any attention. Now, I’m regretting that decision.\n\n\n Even if I decide to brave the dangers and try making mokkan anyway, I still don’t know how to use a knife, though!\n\n\n When I can’t do more than timidly scrape wood off a pencil, there’s no way I’d be able to wield a knife like this with any amount of skill. Will I really be able to make mokkan?\n\n\n As an experiment, I dig through my pile of gathered branches until I find a thin branch, then I try to shave a layer off of it. It’s difficult to manage with my tiny, weak hands, but I peel off a sizable strip of bark, revealing the color of the wood inside.\n\n\n Ah! This might be a little bit on the difficult side, but I think I can do it!\n\n\n I can simultaneously practice using my knife and make mokkan as well, killing two birds with one stone. With glee, I start pulling out the pieces of wood that I had gathered, whittling them until they’re long, narrow, straight, and flat, then cut them to the same length and lay them out next to each other. Once I tie these together with a thin cord, I’ll be able to roll them up like a scroll, and they’ll really be mokkan. I think I can turn these into something about the size of a page from a memo pad.\n\n\n Ancient civilizations, ancestors, thank you for your magnificent wisdom. Mother, father, thank you for this magnificent knife. It is thanks to you that I can make these mokkan.\n\n\n Since the raw materials for these are just pieces of wood that I can pick up from the ground, this involves far less labor than carefully extracting grass fibers to make papyrus or doing the back-breaking excavation work needed to get the clay to make tablets.\n\n\n Excellent.\n\n\n At my level of skill, I need to whittle away bit by bit to get each stick planed flat enough that I can write on it. It would be amazing if I could slice it all off in a single, powerful stroke, but there’s really no point in wishing for the moon. I steadily whittle away at each stick, piling more and more finished mokkan next to me. With my hands as they are now, all I can whittle are fine, slender sticks. If I want to be able to actually write a book, the number of these things I’ll need is not trivial at all.\n\n\n “Maine, what are you making to replace your clay tablets?” says Lutz as he walks over, seemingly done with gathering firewood for the day, and leans in to inspect my handiwork.\n\n\n Note: Lutz uses the actual word for “clay tablets” here, as opposed to a phonetic pronunciation. This would indicate that either the Japanese word has entered his vocabulary as a loanword or they’ve found an equivalent term in their native tongue. (Or the author goofed.)\n\n\n That was not the question I expected him to ask at all. I look at him quizzically.\n\n\n “…Huh? Why do you think I’m making these to replace my tablets?”\n\n\n “Because you looked like you were having so much fun, right?”\n\n\n “Huh? I looked like I was having fun?”\n\n\n “Yeah, you looked like you wanted to rub your face all over those sticks. It was the same kind of expression you had when you saw all the clay for the first time, you know?”\n\n\n Huh? I was sitting alone, whittling, with an expression that looked like I wanted to bury my face in a pile of wood? …Wouldn’t that make me look really strange?\n\n\n …Yiiikes! I didn’t realize that at all! That’s extremely embarrassing!\n\n\n The embarrassment of having that so unexpectedly pointed out to me makes my insides squirm, but Lutz is very focused on examining my handiwork.\n\n\n “So, what are you making?”\n\n\n “…I’m making 'mokkan’.”\n\n\n “'Moe-kahn’? Are you going to be writing on these too?”\n\n\n “Yeah, which is why I need a lot of them. I’m not very strong, so I can’t make them any bigger than this.”\n\n\n I pick up my knife again and start whittling away. Lutz sits down next to me and grabs a somewhat larger stick of his own.\n\n\n “I’ll help you out! Do me a favor in return though: the next time you see that Otto guy you were talking about, could you ask him something for me?”\n\n\n “What do you want to know?”\n\n\n He glances around the forest clearing nervously, then leans in close to whisper in to me quietly. “I want to hear what it’s like to be a trader…”\n\n\n A while ago, he shared with me his dreams of becoming a trader or a minstrel, traveling from town to town and seeing the world.\n\n\n Based on the fact that he was so cautious about checking to see if anyone was around and the fact that he kept his voice so low, I wonder if this world looks down on traders and minstrels? I don’t really know. My personal opinion, lacking any grounding in this world’s common sense, is definitely not worth as much to Lutz as what I could get from Otto if I asked him about it.\n\n\n “He’s a very busy man, but I’ll try asking him. He might refuse, though, sorry.”\n\n\n “That’s okay,” he replies.\n\n\n He breathes a sudden sigh of relief, looking like someone who has just set down a very heavy burden. He’s finally found someone to talk to about something that he couldn’t share with anyone.\n\n\n We don’t talk very much after that, and just quietly sit making mokkan. It looks like Lutz carries a large, wide-bladed knife like Tory’s, so he’s able to easily turn relatively thick branches into several wide boards each. I take those and use my own knife to clean up the writing surfaces until both sides are flawless.\n\n\n I wonder if I’ll be able to get someone to give me some of the ink that we use at the gate?\n\n\n Fundamentally, ink is something that is used with paper, so it’s not the kind of thing that you can ordinarily find in stores around here. Now that I think about it, the ink at the gate is locked up as carefully as the parchment is. It might not just be paper that’s expensive, but ink as well.\n\n\n Hopefully, I’ll be able to convince Otto to stop paying my salary in slate pencils and to switch over to paying me ink. And, while I’m at it, I’ll be able to convey Lutz’s request.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, I go to the gates.\n\n\n It’s a day where Tory has work and is thus not available to supervise me, so I head to the gates to study. Lately, the number of words I’ve been learning that are actually usable day-to-day has been increasing, which makes me very happy.\n\n\n Starting today, we have three new apprentice soldiers; Tory’s contemporaries. Otto has to teach them how to read, write, and do math, so he’s suddenly very busy. After he finishes with training the new recruits, he immediately returns to the duty room and does all of the normal day-to-day work he has to do.\n\n\n I myself am very busy, between learning new vocabulary and helping with computation, so I don’t have very many opportunities to talk. When I notice Otto finish up one set of paperwork and start working to clean up the ink bottle, I seize my chance.\n\n\n “Mister Otto, I’ve got a question I want to ask, is now okay?”\n\n\n “Sure, what is it?”\n\n\n “How do you become a trader?”\n\n\n “Huh?! Maine, you want to become a trader?! Huh? Wait a minute! Is this my fault? Squad Leader’s going to murder me!”\n\n\n With huge, panicked eyes, Otto hunches forward over the desk, muttering hysterically. I’m shocked by this sudden display, and quickly wave my hands to try to dispel his fears.\n\n\n “No, no, it’s not for me, it’s for a friend.”\n\n\n “Ah! Well then, you should tell them that they shouldn’t try.”\n\n\n “Oh, it really is like that?”\n\n\n Based on his terse response, it would seem like peddling is indeed an objectionable profession.\n\n\n “What do you mean by 'like that’?” he says, his eyes narrowing. I briefly contemplate how to phrase things in an easy-to-convey manner, then open my mouth to speak.\n\n\n “Ummm, when my friend asked me about it, he made sure that nobody was around, and he was whispering, so I thought that maybe people thought it wasn’t a good job to do.”\n\n\n “Well, his parents would give him a good talking to, anyway.”\n\n\n “Also, traders are always traveling, right? They’re always going here and there, thinking about what they need to buy in one place and what they need to sell in another, right? Settling down is a completely different lifestyle, where you can have familial bonds and even repeat customers, so it’s not the kind of thing that you’d think a kid who lives in a town would suddenly think that they’d want to do…”\n\n\n That kind of free-wandering nomadic lifestyle seems like the kind of thing that the children of farmers, who are expected to settle down, would be drawn to. Life is so fundamentally different here, to the point where my own common knowledge doesn’t connect with it at all. Working seems to be far more strict of a thing than I was expecting.\n\n\n Every day, I do things that completely backfire, and I often have no idea of why they could have possibly done so. You’d think that at some point the correct answer to be to do nothing, but even if I did nothing I’d still wind up being criticized. There’s no manual for the mass of unwritten rules that govern daily life here. I, the woman who has no idea what the correct thing to do is in this unexpected alternate reality and just wants to shut herself inside forever, do truly understand the barriers of common sense.\n\n\n Well, if I were to lock myself inside, I wouldn’t have any books, so I wouldn’t have anything to do, so I basically have to go outside anyway.\n\n\n “…Well, if you know that much, why didn’t you tell him?”\n\n\n “Hmm, well, I think that it would be better if he heard it from you, Otto. I’ve been living in a town all my life, but you’ve got a lot of experience, so I think he’d listen to you. Also, my daddy said that you have some connections with the merchant guild, right? If my friend can’t become a trader, then maybe he could do his apprenticeship under a merchant instead. I was thinking that maybe he could still leave the town from time to time to go buy things.”\n\n\n As far as Lutz’s family goes, I think they’d be much more comfortable if his travels were to known parts of the world on official business, rather than aimlessly wandering through distant lands.\n\n\n “Ahhh, I see what’s happening here!” he says, the corners of his mouth quirking up in a sly grin. “Since you’re making all this effort to be the middleman here, this kid must be your favorite, right?”\n\n\n He seems to have caught a whiff of a secret love story. I shrug my shoulders.\n\n\n “It’s not that he’s my favorite,” I say off-handedly, “it’s that he’s always helping me out, so I feel like I should return the favor before the debts start stacking up too high.”\n\n\n “The kid who’s helping you, is that the blond one?”\n\n\n Otto must have seen us one on of the times that Lutz, serving as my pacemaker, came through the gate, dragging my exhausted self back from the forest, stopping briefly to deliver a report to my father in exchange for a little bit of pocket money.\n\n\n “That’s right. I know that you’re super busy with the newcomers, though, so if you can’t do it…”\n\n\n “This is actually the least-busy season in the entire year, so this is a great time. How about during the next holiday?”\n\n\n “Thanks, Mister Otto!”\n\n\n Although, if this is supposed to be the least busy season, how much work am I going to actually have when it’s time for me to help out with the treasurer’s report and the budget compilations? I’ve already agreed to help, though, so that’s not something I want to thinking about.\n\n\n “Ah! Mister Otto, I’ve got one more thing I want to ask: could I please have a little bit of this ink, if you can?”\n\n\n “You mean this ink?” he says, frowning as he taps the closed lid of the inkwell with one finger. The black liquid within sloshes slightly.\n\n\n I nod vigorously. “Could you maybe pay me in ink instead of slate pencils from now on?”\n\n\n “That’s three years’ wages, and I’m not giving you an advance.”\n\n\n “What?!”\n\n\n His instantaneous reply leaves me dumbfounded, my eyes wide with shock. I want to believe that I absolutely must have misheard him, but his expression is very serious as he starts to explain.\n\n\n “After you move from assistant to apprentice, your wages are going to change, but right now, even including the bonus you’ll get from helping with the budget, it’ll take you three years, I think.”\n\n\n “Three years?! …That’s expensive!”\n\n\n My expression is one of utter shock. There’s no way I could have possibly expected that it would be that expensive. Otto’s wry smile says that he’s going to have to start teaching me the names of the things on our budget.\n\n\n “Even here, we only ever use it for the official paperwork that the nobility gives us, right? It’s far too pricey of a thing for a child to play with.”\n\n\n In other words, this is absolutely not a thing that I will be able to purchase for myself. Understood.\n\n\n …If that’s the case, what should I use to write on my mokkan? Even if I have the boards, they’re useless if I can’t write on them, right?"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Gaaah! I solved my paper problem, but now I have to get ink, too! Why meee!”\n\n\n No store in this area sells anything like the ballpoint pens and mechanical pencils I’m used to. There are no regular pencils, no fountain pens, and, of course, there’s neither liquid nor block ink. If ink were freely available, then I wouldn’t need anything more than a sharp stick to write with, but ink is so expensive that I can’t obtain it at all. I know how much the slate pencils I get paid in cost, but I don’t know what my special wages will be during bonus season, so I can’t use Otto’s three-year estimate to calculate how much it actually costs.\n\n\n It’s three years’ worth of work, you know?\n\n\n My options here are: buy it, find it, be given it, steal it, and make it. Thinking about it, the only real option I have is to make it.\n\n\n After all, there’s no way I can actually steal any from the night duty room…\n\n\n It seems like it’s not just books that I have to hand-make, but ink as well. Even so, is making ink even something that I’m capable of doing? I know that it involves a pigment and a drying oil, but will I be able to acquire whatever pigments and oils exist in this world?\n\n\n “Wouldn’t it be great if I could just find an ‘octopus’ or a 'squid’? Where the heck is the ocean?!” I shout, tightly clutching the mokkan I’ve been carving. Lutz, sitting next to me, flinches. “What now?!” he says, turning to look at me.\n\n\n “Lutz, can you think of anything here I can use as ink?! Or even a way I can make it?!”\n\n\n Of course, going on a journey to the ocean and fishing up a octopi and squid is unrealistic. However, I can’t think of a single thing amongst my possessions that I could use to make either a liquid or solid ink.\n\n\n “What’s 'ink’?”\n\n\n “Ummm, it’s a black liquid, that you use for writing on things like these boards…”\n\n\n Explaining the concept of ink to someone who’d ordinarily never see anything like it is rather difficult. Lutz tilts his head in confusion as I try to lay it out for him.\n\n\n “A black thing? If you don’t mind unclean sorts of things, then do you think maybe ash or soot might work?”\n\n\n “Yeah, that! I’ll try that!”\n\n\n If I’m going to use ash or soot, then that’s something that my home always has around in the cinders of our fireplace. This is something that I can undoubtedly get immediately.\n\n\n As soon as I return home, I immediately try asking my mother.\n\n\n “Mommy, can I use some of this ash?”\n\n\n “No, you can’t,” she replies immediately, rejecting me without any hesitation.\n\n\n “Huh? Why not?”\n\n\n “We use ash to make soap, melt snow, dye things, sell to farmers… it has a lot of uses, you know? Please don’t arbitrarily waste any of it.”\n\n\n Come to think of it, when spring came around, I helped scatter ashes around for some incomprehensible reason, like I was in Hanasaka Jiisan.1 I guess that was for melting snow, huh? I only just figured that out now. If we need to use a lot of it for making soap, then I guess it really is an important material.\n\n\n Since we can sell whatever’s left over, it seems like it would be difficult for me to acquire any ash, but I wonder if my other option, using soot, would be feasible?\n\n\n “Then, Mommy, could I use the soot?”\n\n\n My mother scowls a little bit after I asked for another thing, but after a moment she suddenly breaks out into a smile.\n\n\n “Well, I don’t know what you want to use it for, but, sure, you can have some soot.”\n\n\n “Oh, yay!”\n\n\n “You can have whatever you can sweep out of the stove. You can get even more if you clean out the chimney too, you know!”\n\n\n “Wha?! …Ah… right. …I guess, you’re right.”\n\n\n My grinning mother has taken advantage of my plight, and now I get to sweep out the chimney. This wasn’t what I’d expected to have to do, but if it’s for the sake of gathering soot, then I’ve got no choice. With fire in my eyes, I grab the narrow broom we use for sweeping the chimney, only to be stopped by my mother, her grin slipping from her face.\n\n\n “Wait just one second, Maine! Are you planning on doing that in those clothes?!”\n\n\n “…Huh? I shouldn’t?”\n\n\n These clothes are already kind of dirty and worn-out, so I have no idea how it could possibly be a problem for me to sweep out the stove in clothes like this. I look skeptically at my mother as she goes to get her sewing kit and the box of old cleaning rags.\n\n\n “I’ll make you something better, wait for a moment.”\n\n\n With high spirits, my mother stitches together some clothing made out of cleaning rags with lightning speed. I change into my new cleaning-rag clothes, then decide that it wouldn’t do at all for my hair to get stained with soot, so I pin it up and use another rag as a bandana to cover my head.\n\n\n Wow, I never thought I’d be doing Cinderella cosplay, but here I am.\n\n\n First of all, I scrape the ashes out of the bottom of the fireplace and set them aside. After that, I stick my head in the oven and start knocking down and collecting all of the soot that I can. This is probably the first time I’ve actually been glad to have such a small body. I can’t deny my mother’s smile, so while I was at it I started sweeping out the chimney to collect the soot from there as well. As black particles crumble from the walls, the chimney starts looking cleaner and cleaner, and the pile of my much sought-after soot grows taller and taller.\n\n\n This is way more fun than I thought it was going to be when I started out, and I got so engrossed in it that I wound up pushing myself too hard. The next day, my fever came back and I was laid out all day.\n\n\n I may be covered in soot, I may have collapsed, but I somehow managed to collect my pile of soot. Now I need to get my health back as well… I really want to get better enough today to start working on writing with this soot.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Maine,” asks Lutz, “what do we do with this?”\n\n\n “I think we try water first?”\n\n\n The first step that I came up with is dissolving the soot in water. I feel like it might turn into something ink-like. Somehow. I scoop a little bit of water from the river into a wooden bowl add some soot, and then stir it round and round with a piece of wood. The soot doesn’t seem to dissolve very well, and most of it just floats on top of the water.\n\n\n “It turned out like this, huh…” I mumble.\n\n\n “Well, I wonder how well you can write with it?”\n\n\n I nod at him, then dip the sharpened stick we’re using in place of a pen into the bowl. Tentatively, I try marking the top of one of my mokkan with its page number, “1”. However, way more of the soot stuck to my stick than to the wood of the board, and the number that I wrote is so faint as to be illegible.\n\n\n “Ah, man… That’s a failure.”\n\n\n “What’s next?”\n\n\n “Hmmm, well, my original theory was that I should try mixing the soot with oil, but…”\n\n\n Oil is one thing I can’t request from my mother. Vegetable oil is used not only in a lot of our cooking, but I also use a lot of it to make my simple shampoo, so we never have enough of it. Also, animal-based oils are used for making candles and soaps, so I think that’s not something I can easily get either. Probably, my mother would shoot down my request as quickly as she did when I asked about the ashes.\n\n\n “Using oil, huh. I guess you couldn’t get any?”\n\n\n “Yeah, it’s impossible. Is there nothing else we could try…?”\n\n\n Searching for hints, I flip through in my mind all of the Japanese writing implements I can think of.\n\n\n “Ah, the 'paints’ that were used in 'Japanese painting’ used 'gelatin glue’… but, I’m not allowed to use any fire, so that’s not going to work.”\n\n\n In the future, I might be able to try making a gelatin-based ink, but right now I don’t have that kind of setup. If I were to be able to use gelatin, then I could make paints out of natural materials, so my options would dramatically increase. However, I can’t actually wait until I grow up.\n\n\n “Heeey, Maine, you still with me?” says Lutz, waving his hand back and forth in front of my face to bring my thoughts back down to earth. “Snap out of it.”\n\n\n “Hmmm, well, it’s probably okay if it’s not a liquid. We could make something like 'crayons’ or 'chalk’ or… 'pencils’… Ah, right! We can use clay! Let’s mix it with clay!”\n\n\n “Huhh?” he says, an extremely skeptical look on this face.\n\n\n “If I’m not mistaken, mixing 'graphite’ with clay will give me something like 'pencil lead’. Like, um… 'conté’, maybe…?2 Well, whatever. We’re using soot, not 'graphite’, but I think it’ll work out!”\n\n\n Mix soot and clay, make it into round, slender sticks, then let them dry out. Once they harden up, I may actually be able to write with them.\n\n\n “Lutz, back when we were making 'clay tablets’, we dug up the clay somewhere around here, right?”\n\n\n “We don’t have to dig any up, actually. Last time, we dug up more than we used, and I think we put the leftovers somewhere around that rock.”\n\n\n Just like he says, there’s a small pile of clay over there. I take a bit of it, then knead soot into it until it’s thoroughly mixed. My mental image here is something like a Coupy Pencil3 or the core of a pencil. If touching it doesn’t blacken your fingertips, it won’t produce a usable color.\n\n\n Both my hands and the rock that I’m using as a work surface get stained pitch black as I work. I roll my soot pencils into long, slender tubes, then cut them down to about the length of a pencil. If these harden up when they dry, then this will be a great success.\n\n\n I try to wash my hands off in the river, but they don’t get much cleaner. I’m going to have to scrub down with soap when I get home. These persistent stains, however, make me feel like I’ll definitely be able to write with these.\n\n\n “How long should we let these dry for, I wonder?” I say.\n\n\n “Who knows?”\n\n\n “Should we maybe try baking them?”\n\n\n “Let’s not do anything unnecessary. They might explode again.”\n\n\n “Urgh…”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Over the next few days, my soot pencils gradually start to dry out and solidify. I wrap one in an old dust rag so that I’ll be able to use it without staining my hands. After that, I use my knife to sharpen the tip, then try writing a letter.\n\n\n It writes! It may crumble very easily in my grip, but for now, I can write with these. These will be less like books and more like antique media, but this works.\n\n\n “We did it! Lutz, it writes!”\n\n\n “Oh! Good job.”\n\n\n I, having made my own writing implements from scratch, cheerfully work on making more mokkan. Since I have a guaranteed source of materials as long as I go out to gather firewood, I can accumulate these things very cheaply. The best part about this is that I’m able to do everything, from start to finish, with my own power. The only major problem with these is that they’ll be very bulky when they start to pile up, but that was going to be a problem with clay tablets, anyway. I’ll just have to deal with it until I’m an independent adult.\n\n\n My pile of completed mokkan grows to satisfaction, but one day I return from the forest to unexpectedly find that they’ve disappeared. The place I’ve been stockpiling them is suddenly empty.\n\n\n “G… gone?! They’re gone? What?!”\n\n\n “What’s wrong, Maine?”\n\n\n As I frantically search through the storeroom for my missing mokkan, my mother pokes her head in to see what’s the matter.\n\n\n “Mommy, do you know what happened to the 'mokkan’ I left here?”\n\n\n “'Moe-kahn’? Well, what are those?”\n\n\n “Ummm, they’re pieces of wood, and they’re a bunch of different sizes, but they’ve all been flattened on both sides so that I can write on them…”\n\n\n “Ah, the firewood you brought back? I used it, you know?”\n\n\n “Uh? Huh? You used it? Why?”\n\n\n My head suddenly goes completely blank.\n\n\n “It was the firewood that you worked so diligently to bring back after you worked so hard to get strong enough to help out, you know? It wouldn’t be nice for me to not use it.”\n\n\n “But, the pile of firewood is over there, right? Why did you use the pile that I specifically kept separated from that? Those were a compilation of the fairy tales you told me to get me to sleep at night!”\n\n\n “Aw,” she says, stroking my head, “if you want me to tell you stories, all you need to do is ask.” She smiles, thinking that her daughter will still be spoiled rotten no matter how much time may pass.\n\n\n “That’s not what I meant…”\n\n\n Not a single one is left. I stare blankly at the spot where my mokkan used to be, and all of the strength leaves my body. All of the effort I put into them, all of the struggle, was for naught. They’re cinders. When I think about that, I don’t think I can get motivated for anything again.\n\n\n The moment my strength fails me, a heat that was buried deep inside my body explodes out. A fever, stronger than the ones I get after getting too excited or working too hard, blasts through me in an instant. In its grip, my limbs go numb and I lose all ability to move.\n\n\n “What’s…”\n\n\n Without any understanding of what could possibly be happening within my body, I suddenly collapse, whimpering like I was trapped in a nightmare.\n\n\n My consciousness trembles as I slowly sink deeper into the churning, swirling fever. I feel like I’m slowly dying, bit by bit, under the fever’s relentless assault. It’s only now that I’m experiencing it firsthand that I can clearly comprehend how the real Maine could have been swallowed whole by a fever like this.\n\n\n As I slip further and further away, without even the willpower to struggle against it, flashes of worried faces pass through my consciousness, my family members looking in, concerned, to check on me. Lutz’s face is among them.\n\n\n …Why… is Lutz…?\n\n\n I push my way up towards him, and my submerged consciousness starts to float back to the surface. I strain my temples, pushing even harder, and everything comes into focus. This isn’t just an image that floated itself across my mind. I’ve consciously managed to get Lutz focused in my field of view.\n\n\n “Maine?” he says, his eyes wide.\n\n\n “…Lutz?”\n\n\n “Mrs. Eva!” he yells, turning towards the kitchen. “Maine w…woke up!”\n\n\n My mother rushes into the room.\n\n\n “Maine. You collapsed so suddenly, and I thought you’d never wake up again!”\n\n\n “Yeah… sometimes, I saw your face. I’m sorry to make you worry. …Mommy, my throat is really scratchy. I feel really sticky too, so I want to wash myself off. Could you bring me some water?”\n\n\n “Alright, I’ll be right back,” she says, turning to leave.\n\n\n As soon as I see her step out, I grab Lutz’s hand tightly. I still can’t even raise my head, lying down like this.\n\n\n “…Lutz,” I whisper, “I failed again. My mother burned all of my 'mokkan’.”\n\n\n “Oh maaan… Well, they do really just look like weirdly-shaped cuts of wood.”\n\n\n “But I put so much effort into them, and I put them aside on purpose…”\n\n\n I can’t take anymore. Fate itself has decreed that I’m never going to finish my book.\n\n\n I sigh in defeat, and I can feel the fever start to come back to life. I shake my head to clear it before I’m pulled under again.\n\n\n “Don’t get so down,” says Lutz. “Doesn’t that just mean that we should try something that doesn’t burn well?”\n\n\n My mokkan were made out of wood, so they were used for firewood. If that’s the case, then we should make them out of something that won’t get burned. Lutz’s suggestion is like a spark of light in the darkness.\n\n\n Now is not the time to be drowning in fever. I need to think of a good replacement material. I focus all of my willpower inward, feeling like I’m grabbing hold of the fever and squeezing it down into the tiniest ball I can.\n\n\n “…What do you think we could use that wouldn’t burn?” I say, after a long pause. I’ve put some thought into it, but I really can’t come up with anything, either because my mind is still hazy from the fever or because I just don’t know what I could find around here that would work.\n\n\n “Ummm, maybe, bamboo, or something like that?”\n\n\n “Ah!! …Lutz, you’re a genius!”\n\n\n Bamboo pops when it burns, so it’s probably not the kind of thing that you’d simply burn. Hope floods through me once more. When that happens, for some reason my fever starts going down as well, and I can breathe a little more comfortably.\n\n\n “Oh, what are you talking about?” asks my mother, entering the room carrying a bucket of water. Lutz and I glance at each other.\n\n\n “It’s a secret,” I say, with a little grin.\n\n\n “Maine,” says Lutz, “I’ll go out and get that, so you absolutely need to make sure you get better, okay?”\n\n\n “Thanks, Lutz! You’re so sweet.”\n\n\n His eyes go wide. “Th-this is just so you’ll introduce me to Otto!” he yells, fleeing from the room. “I’m paying you in advance, so you’d better get healthy! Got it?!”\n\n\n As his footsteps fade away, I start to scrub myself down with the water that my mother brought in for me.\n\n\n This fever was strange. I can’t think of a single disease that would cause a fever to suddenly explode out like that, especially not one that would slowly devour at my consciousness. Plus, I’ve definitely never heard of any sort of fever that could be forced aside through sheer willpower alone. What the heck kind of sickness is this, wriggling around in my body?\n\n\n When I first came here, I was getting feverish fairly regularly, but I didn’t think that was particularly strange. However, once I managed to train my body into being a little bit more robust, then the strangeness of my fevers became much more apparent. What the heck could be wrong with this body? My family, however, is not at all affluent enough to afford a doctor in this world, and there’s no encyclopedia of common diseases around, so this isn’t something that I can immediately research.\n\n\n …Well, if I concentrate on bringing down my fever, it seems to go down slowly, so maybe we’ll just wait and see?\n\n\n ***\n\n\n After two more days of thinking about dealing with my fever, Lutz comes to my home in the evening, with a bundle of bamboo that he cut down to the perfect size for use as bamboo slips.4 He even shaved off all of the skin, so I can start writing on them right away.\n\n\n “Don’t even think about touching these until you’re healthy again,” he says, sternly. “Got it? If you break this promise, I’ll never help you again.”\n\n\n “Okay. Thanks, Lutz.”\n\n\n I hold on to just one slip, and ask my mother to put the rest of them in the storage room. I’m still too sick to get out of bed, but as soon as my fever’s gone down all the way, I’ll be able to write on these and then finally finish my work. My first priority, then, is to get better.\n\n\n Holding tightly to the bamboo slip that Lutz brought me in one hand, I gradually drift off to sleep. Just when I was almost completely out, though, loud cracks start piercing through the air.\n\n\n “Gyaah?!” screams my mother from the kitchen.\n\n\n “W… what?! What happened?”\n\n\n Crack after crack rings out from within the oven, like there’s something inside that’s bursting open. My mother storms into the room, livid.\n\n\n “Maine! What did Lutz bring into this house?!”\n\n\n “…Bamboo?”\n\n\n “Ugh! That was misleading! I thought he was bringing us firewood, since you can’t go and get any!”\n\n\n I suddenly realize the source of those cracking sounds. She burnt the bamboo, thinking that it was firewood. It sounds like it’s exploding with far more force than the bamboo that I’m used to; is bamboo different in this world?\n\n\n “Oh, did you mistake it for firewood, since the skin was already shaved off? …Wait, don’t bamboo and wood look different, though?”\n\n\n “Bamboo and vanihitz wood look very similar, you know?”\n\n\n “I’ve never seen that kind of tree before, so I guess I didn’t know…”\n\n\n I don’t recognize the name of that tree. At least, when I was at the forest, I didn’t see any sort of tree that resembled bamboo.\n\n\n “What are you talking about? That’s the wood you were using to weave baskets with Tory during the winter. It’s what your own basket’s made out of!”\n\n\n “Oh, I remember now. I guess they really do look similar once you peel off the bark.”\n\n\n I remember, now that I think back to the preparations that Tory had been doing for her basket-weaving winter work. Vanihitz wood looks like any other wood while the bark is on, but it looks very much like bamboo once it’s peeled off.\n\n\n “Anyway, don’t bring any more bamboo into the house. It’s dangerous! Are we clear?”\n\n\n “…Yes…”\n\n\n Bamboo is forbidden as well. Yeah, I was afraid of this, ever since I heard those first pops. I’m sorry, Lutz, since you tried so hard…\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. Hanasaka Jiisan is a Japanese folktale.\n\n\n 2.

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Here are some things that happened while I was still waiting for my soot pencils to dry out.\n\n\n Now that Tory’s started going to work, cooking has been added to my list of duties. However, I can’t hold a kitchen knife very well and I don’t really know how to make or properly use fire, so right now there’s very little that I can do from start to finish entirely on my own. Right now, I work with my mother, helping out as much as I possibly can.\n\n\n I’ve been struggling with this for a while, but I really want to do a few experiments to see if I can finally start eating Japanese food again. Originally, I was ready to blast this kitchen apart with all my modern knowledge, but when I let it loose, the result was less of a blast and more of a fizzle.\n\n\n After all, it’s fundamentally hopeless, right from the beginning. I really crave Japanese food, but there’s no rice. No miso. No soy sauce. You can’t buy mirin or other kinds of sake anywhere, of course. If I don’t have the right seasonings, I don’t think I’ve got any options. I can’t think of anything I can actually make.\n\n\n Well, you know, I actually do know how to make miso and soy sauce, right? If I’ve got the ingredients, I’ve got the knowhow. It’s just soybeans and koji1. I learned it in elementary school! We went on a field trip to a miso factory, and I actually paid a lot of attention to how they made it in the olden days.\n\n\n But, where do I find soybeans or koji in this world? It’s possible that I could substitute some other kind of bean for soybeans, but where can I actually buy koji? Of course, you can make koji from things that you can find in nature, but that’s a really scary proposition. After all, koji is mold, right? If I mess up even a little bit, I’m going to drag every single member of my family into a nightmare of food poisoning. Even if I were to just happen across koji, then there’s still the terrifying thought of trying to ferment something in this bacteria-infested place, plus it will put off enough of a stench that it’ll get thrown out long before it’s complete.\n\n\n So, I gave up on making my own seasonings and started thinking long and hard about what kinds of Japanese food I could possibly make without any Japanese seasonings at all.\n\n\n How about sashimi? We don’t have any soy sauce, but if you eat it with citrus fruit juice mixed with salt, that would still be tasty, right?\n\n\n Although, this place doesn’t seem to be close to the ocean. Even when I search through the town market, I can’t find anyone selling fresh saltwater fish. There’s no wakame or other kinds of seaweed for sale, either. Forget sashimi, I can’t even make a seaweed salad.\n\n\n So, if there’s no seafood, there’s obviously no kombu. No bonito flakes, either. I want to make Japanese food, but I can’t even make dashi2. This is a fatal blow.\n\n\n Man, I’m not even going to ask for instant dashi… just, give me some kombu and bonito flakes, please?\n\n\n There’s these cucumber-like things that could be pickled, but I don’t have soy sauce, my mother won’t let me use any sugar, and I don’t have any kind of vinegar to use except wine vinegar, so the taste is so wildly different that I can’t be satisfied with it at all. I tried making it once, but it was so harshly sour that it was nothing at all like the pickles I was thinking of.\n\n\n Vexed over my inability to do anything at all, I tried something very simple that even a child like me could do: I rubbed salt into slices of a pseudo-cucumber and ate it. The salt drew out a little bit of the moisture and made it just a little bit more tender, and it had the perfect amount of saltiness to remind me just a little of tsukemono3. I thought that I’d finally be satisfied once I’d tasted something remotely Japanese-y, but, on the contrary, it only made me cry for the white rice I so dearly miss. Incidentally, I tried putting the salted cucumber on the multi-grain bread we have in the house, but that didn’t work at all; they don’t have particularly good affinity.\n\n\n Rice! Rice! Japanese food! Someone, please! Give me some Japanese food!!\n\n\n Thanks to those cucumbers, my cravings for Japanese food became so great that I thought I might try going to the river, catching some fish, and making something even vaguely Japanese. I can’t use fire, so I don’t have any alternatives but drying, so I decided to try drying out whatever fish I could catch. If I brought along some salt, then I could salt the fish and let it dry, and that might even work. …I really hoped it would work.\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz,” I said. “I want to catch some fish. Can I do that in this river?”\n\n\n “I don’t think you’d be able to.”\n\n\n Just like he said, I was completely defeated. Fishing is, by itself, its own challenge.\n\n\n As I sat there, dejected, Lutz caught some fish and brought them over to me.\n\n\n “Look, I caught some, but what are you thinking of doing?”\n\n\n “Can I have these?”\n\n\n “Yeah, sure, I don’t really need them.”\n\n\n “Lutz… are you able to make a fire? I want to try making ‘shioyaki’.”4\n\n\n I can’t wait at all, so I try cooking the fish he brought me shioyaki-style, like I would sweetfish. Then, I took a bite.\n\n\n …Foul!\n\n\n Bitter!\n\n\n Awful!\n\n\n My face immediately scrunched up after just one bite. Strange, it was far less refined of a taste than I was expecting. What on earth could make it smell so awful? I didn’t think my grilling methods were wrong, so I tilted my head to the side, searching my memories to figure out what could have possibly happened. Lutz looked on with a frown.\n\n\n “If you don’t cook it right,” he says, “it must really stink when you eat it like that, right?”\n\n\n “……Yeah, it stinks.”\n\n\n This is a stinky fish. It would have been great if he told me that earlier.\n\n\n Next, I pulled out my knife. It’s different both in form and function than a modern kitchen knife, and it’s a little bit worn, but that’s not going to have any effect on the flavor. I sharpened a stick and then speared the fish through, thinking I could actually make dried food like this. I left it alone for a while as I gathered firewood so the sun could dry it out. While I wasn’t paying attention, though, it suddenly became rock-hard and inedible. It seems like, somehow, too much moisture evaporated.\n\n\n “Maine… what is this?”\n\n\n “…Fish that dried too much. Dried fish is supposed to be food, but you can’t eat this at all.”\n\n\n “Yeah, I’ll say. No matter how I look at it, that doesn’t look like food at all.”\n\n\n “I might be able to make 'dashi’ with this, though. I’m going to bring these home and try that out.”\n\n\n This might have been inedible as dried food, but there was a chance I might be able to use it as a base for dashi. When I got home, carrying the withered husks of the fish, I tried my hand at making dashi.\n\n\n “Maine, what are you doing?!” yelled my mother as soon as she saw what I was doing. “That’s disgusting! Don’t you dare put that thing in my pot!”\n\n\n “Umm, Mommy, I want to try making 'dashi’, though…”\n\n\n “Absolutely not! The only thing that goes in that pot is food.”\n\n\n …It probably would have become food, though.\n\n\n Thanks to the fact that my mother finds dried fish disgusting, my plans to make dashi have been strongly prohibited. Maybe it’s because of the fact that she doesn’t often see fish in her daily life that she seems to think that dried-out fish are disgusting. Even though she did look at a pig whose skull was split half open and say that it looked delicious…\n\n\n I’m sorry, Mister Fish.\n\n\n In conclusion: making Japanese food is impossible, at least for me. Without dashi and without seasonings, there isn’t a single thing left for me to try. Once I give up on finding miso, soy sauce, or sake, there’s basically no Japanese-style cooking left for me to try. I’m keenly aware of how fundamentally important these seasonings are.\n\n\n For now, at least, I need to be thinking about what kind of foods I can make that, even if they’re only tangentially Japanese, still have the kinds of flavors that you might find in Japan. Even that would be worthwhile. Yeah.\n\n\n Then, somehow, a bird was delivered to my house. It seems like one of our neighbors managed to bring down five birds while in the forest. In this season, it would be almost impossible for them to eat all of that before it spoiled, so they gave it to my father, repaying him for when he did that same for them a while ago.\n\n\n The one to handle preparing this bird, whose name I don’t even know, was my mother. The knife used to prepare the meat is very large, so not only I but even Tory can’t handle it.\n\n\n “Maine. Come here and pluck the feathers for me,” she says.\n\n\n “O, okay…”\n\n\n I grabbed hold of the bird as it lay limply on the table, then started pulling out its feathers. The disturbing sensation of the feathers pulling free sent shivers through me, giving me goosebumps. I told myself that I had no choice, and it’s all for the sake of eating it, so I plucked the feathers, struggling not to cry. It looks like it’ll be a long while before doing this sort of work becomes simple for me. However, when it came time to clean out the internal organs, I’m proud to say that I didn’t faint, didn’t run away, and was able to stay standing. I think I’ve grown a little, if I may say so myself.\n\n\n “Now, Maine, we’re ready to start cooking.”\n\n\n “Got it!”\n\n\n After a lot of thought, I realized that I might be able to make a stock out of the leftover chicken carcass. If I have chicken carcass soup as a base, the number of things I can cook dramatically increases. I have neither kombu nor bonito flakes, but I wondered if I could make a usable stock if I substituted some other dried mushrooms for shiitake.\n\n\n However, just making the soup was difficult. My mother had no idea what I wanted to do, and didn’t help at all. It seemed she wanted to eat it grilled. I firmly insisted that it was my day to be the cook, however, and got her to give me the carcass and a few other large cuts of meat. After that, I was left to do everything myself.\n\n\n I filled our biggest pot with water, then added the carcass, some breast meat, and some herbs one-by-one. Next, I started going through our vegetables, looking for things that have the right taste, smell, and texture even if they didn’t have the right taste. I found that smelled like an onion, something that tasted a little like ginger, something that smelled a bit like garlic, and some leaves that were kind of like bay leaves, and so on. In order to get rid of any foul smells the bird might give off, I started adding these things to the pot one by one.\n\n\n “Maine, wait!!” cries my mother, suddenly.\n\n\n I freeze, knife in hand, holding the garlic-smelling plant on the cutting board by the leaves. “Huh?”\n\n\n “That’s too much for you to handle. It’s brutal!”\n\n\n I stared blankly down at the vegetable, which looked like an ordinary radish, but white. She rushed over to confiscate both the knife and the radish. Grasping it tightly by the leaves, she holds it firmly down on the cutting board, giving it a look like she’s daring it to run away. With a scowl, she chopped straight down, slicing the top cleanly off. At the same instant, I heard a sharp scream. From the radish.\n\n\n “Uh? What?”\n\n\n I blinked disbelievingly, convinced that I had to have misheard. My mother let go of the leaves, flipped the knife sideways, and smashed down on the radish with a loud bang, just like how you crush garlic. Crushing it like that took way less time than the fine-grained chopping I was planning on doing, so I thought she had saved me a lot of effort. When she lifted the knife, though, the white flesh of the radish had somehow turned red, almost like blood had spread over its surface. Scary.\n\n\n “All set,” she says. “You can use this once you make sure to wash it properly.”\n\n\n “…Okay.”\n\n\n My mother’s expression seemed far more brutal than the radish was. I was just seeing things, right? Yeah. just seeing things. A trick of the eyes.\n\n\n In this world, I occasionally see vegetables that resemble ones that I know from Earth, but there are lots of incomprehensibly strange foods here too. Whenever I run across a weird ingredient like this one, it only just reawakens the feelings that I’m no longer in the world I know.\n\n\n Despite that little incident, I carefully skimmed the denatured fats off the top of the broth, taking with it the leaves that I used to soak up the bad flavors. I remember hearing that you’re supposed to bring everything to a boil, drain off all the water, and then re-fill the pot clean water, but I’ve never had a soup that tasted bad because I didn’t do that. I ignored that particularly bothersome step and just let it simmer over a low heat.\n\n\n After I let it simmer for a while, I pulled out just the breast meat from the stock. I quickly quenched it in water, then pulled the tender meat apart into shreds. This will be delicious as a garnish on top of a salad.\n\n\n As the soup simmered atop the stove, I worked on preparing the rest of the meat. I took the heart, the gizzard, and the other parts that go bad super easily and chopped them into chunks small enough to easily eat, then sprinkled salt and liquor on them. It’s a simple way of baking these so you can more easily eat them. This is probably the kind of cooking that my family will be most easily able to understand. For an instant, the words “charcoal grill” flashed across my mind, but I had other ways to cook it so I gave up on the idea.\n\n\n Our dinner was going to be organs and thigh meat. My mother slaved away over the thighs, cooking them like roast chicken, and prohibited me from interfering with that at all. I sprinkled salt and liquor on the breast meat, then put it aside in the winter preparation room so that I could use it in the next day’s cooking. If I had a refrigerator or airtight plastic bags, I could make chicken ham, but, alas, I don’t.\n\n\n “…That smells pretty good!” says my mother.\n\n\n “The taste isn’t quite there yet.”\n\n\n My mother had been avoiding the stock pot as if it she thought it contained something unpleasant, but the scent of soup that started wafting through the air made her come a little closer to investigate. There was nothing left to do on the soup but let it simmer and carefully skim off the fat, so I started finely chopping some of the vegetables. Thanks to this body, everything I want to do takes a tremendous amount of time, so it’s best if I start on my next steps early.\n\n\n My first experiment in my plan to eat Japanese-y food was nabe.5 After all, I thought, if you have dashi, you can make nabe, right? I don’t have access the dashi that I’m familiar with, but I had chicken soup. I have neither ponzu6 nor sesame sauce, so I decided to cook pomay (the fruit that looks like a yellow pepper but tastes like a tomato) and some herbs into the broth make it into something like a tomato nabe.\n\n\n I took the wingtips, which my mother says are hard to actually use because they’re so bony, and added them to the pot. While they cooked, I chopped up some various seasonable vegetables, none of which I know the name for, into the right size for serving. When these are all cooked together in the broth, they’ll be quite delicious. That’s nabe’s true charm, I think.\n\n\n “Ah,” I said, “That looks about ready.” I set a strainer on top of our second-biggest pot. “Mommy, could you help me, please?”\n\n\n “What do you need me to do?”\n\n\n “I want to pour all of the soup in here to strain it, so that I can get out the parts I don’t want in it.”\n\n\n “…Right,” she said, looking a little bit relieved, “there’s no way we were going to eat that, after all.”\n\n\n She poured out the chicken carcass soup into the strainer. I washed out the first pot, then had her pour the filtered soup back in there. Our second-biggest pot is the most-used pot in the house, so using that to keep soup stock would be a huge hindrance. Even my next few steps in making pomay nabe needed that pot.\n\n\n I added some chopped, dried mushrooms to the finished soup stock, then got to work on making the pomay nabe. I carefully pulled the edible meat off of the boiled carcass and wingtips that we strained out of the soup, taking care to avoid stabbing myself on all of the tiny bones in the meat.\n\n\n Based on the delicious scent of my mother’s roast chicken that drifted through the room, and the amount of time I think it’s been since we started, I thought it was just about time for me to put the finishing touches on the nabe.\n\n\n “Maine! What are you doing?!”\n\n\n “Putting… the vegetables in?”\n\n\n “You have to boil those first!”\n\n\n Generally speaking, when my mother cooks vegetables she boils them until they’re limp to make them less bitter, then drains the water and uses just the boiled vegetables in the dish. This, however, gets rid of half the flavor and quite a bit of the nutritional value. I can’t really complain about my mother’s cooking, but when it comes to my own recipes, being forced to do things my mother’s way would be a problem.\n\n\n “For this kind of cooking it’s okay,” I explain.\n\n\n “Aren’t you going to ruin that tasty-looking soup that you’ve worked so hard to make?”\n\n\n “It’ll be fine!”\n\n\n I boiled everything together while skimming off the fat, until finally the pomay nabe was complete. I gave it a little taste, and it was great. Even without boiling the vegetables first, everything turned out fine. Yep!\n\n\n “I’m home!” said Tory as she walked through the door. “A~ah! It was coming from here!”\n\n\n “Hi, Tory! What was coming from where?”\n\n\n “I could smell this amazing smell from all the way down the main street! I got really hungry just smelling it as I walked. All the people I was passing were trying to find where it was coming from. I didn’t think it was coming from here!”\n\n\n Is it like how you suddenly get hungry when you pass by a Chinese restaurant or a ramen shop? This chicken carcass soup has a really powerful aroma.\n\n\n “I’m home,” said my father, returning home from the day shift. “Oh! That was my house I was smelling!”\n\n\n It seemed like the scent of my chicken soup reached far and wide. My family gathered at the table, faces gleaming with anticipation. They all came together just in time for their dinner.\n\n\n “This is made from a bird that Al dropped by to give us earlier today,” explains my mother. “He’s returning the favor from when you shared some of your hunting earlier. Maine and I cooked it up.”\n\n\n “So, this unusual recipe is Maine’s, then?”\n\n\n “That’s right.”\n\n\n In the center of the table, my mother placed her roast chicken legs. Next to that is a salad, garnished with pulled chicken breast meat. Near my father, I put the salted, baked organ meats out as snacks, and I lined up bowls of pomay nabe for everyone. When it’s all split out like this, though, it’s not really nabe. It’s more like an ordinary pomay soup.\n\n\n “What’s this?” asks Tory. “It smells really good. Can I eat it?”\n\n\n “It’s pomay soup,” I reply. “I did my best making soup from the bird, so I think it’s going to be delicious. Try it!”\n\n\n As I talked, Tory brought her face really close to her bowl of soup, eyes glittering, then grabbed her spoon and had a taste.\n\n\n “Whoa, delicious! How?! This is really delicious.”\n\n\n My mother tried a mouthful. “Oh my, it is!” she said, sincerely. “I’m really surprised. You were stewing bird bones and you didn’t cook the vegetables first, but it still turned out this well.”\n\n\n It looked like she’d had a knot of anxiety within her about whether it was going to be delicious, since she knew what went into making it.\n\n\n “Amazing, Maine!” said my father, attacking his food with zeal. “You’ve got a real talent for cooking.”\n\n\n I tried a spoonful myself. The chicken stock had a very good flavor, splendidly bringing out the umami of the vegetables. Delicious.\n\n\n Delicious, but not Japanese food.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, I finished gathering firewood in the forest quickly and headed home. The younger kids have to come and go at specific times, but Tory, who’s already been baptized, seems to be able to come and go freely without having to ask permission. I went back early with her.\n\n\n Since I wanted to use the leftover chicken meat, Tory wasn’t the only cook for the day. For round two of my plan to try to eat Japanese food, I wanted to make poultry sakamushi.7 I thought that even though I don’t have sake, it might have a similar feel to it if I use another type of alcohol.\n\n\n “You said you want to use the leftover chicken, do you know what you want to make already?”\n\n\n “Yeah, I want to make 'sakamushi’ out of bird meat, 'gnocchi’, and a salad. How does that sound?”\n\n\n “Umm… I don’t really understand, but I’ll leave it to you.”\n\n\n First up was the gnocchi. I boiled some tubers, mashed them, and mixed them with multigrain flour and a little bit of salt. Commoners don’t have the budgetary freedom to use wheat flour as much as they want, so we use mixed-grain flour instead. It’s a combination of rye, barley, and oats. I mixed it into a dough that’s about as firm as my earlobe, rolled it out into a long tube, and started cutting it into one-centimeter pieces.\n\n\n “If you don’t mind,” I asked, “could you take these things that I’m cutting out and flatten them out like this?” With a bit of difficulty, I use the back of a fork to spread out and flatten a chunk of dough.\n\n\n “Got it,” she said, with a big nod.\n\n\n Spreading out the dough with a fork leaves ridges, so when it’s rolled into a finger shape, it holds sauce very easily. One by one, Tory stretched out each piece of dough that I cut off. Since she has more strength than I do, every piece I cut off is stretched into the right shape in no time.\n\n\n “Tory, you’re way better at this than me.”\n\n\n “Really? …Maine, don’t look at me, you just keep cutting. I’ll run out if you don’t, you know?”\n\n\n I have Tory fill up a pot with water, put everything in, and bring it to a roiling boil. When they started floating to the top of the pot, they were finished. I took the leftover pomay soup from last night, add more pomay to it, and stew it until it’s reduced to a thick sauce. Right before it’s time to eat, I’ll mix the gnocchi with this sauce, but that’s about all I can do on this for now.\n\n\n “That’s all for now, right? The salad comes together really quickly, too…”\n\n\n “Mom will be home soon, so it’s okay if we start the salad now, right?”\n\n\n As Tory and I made the salad, our mother came home. As soon as I saw her come in, I went to the winter preparation room to fetch the breast meat I set aside yesterday so that I could start on the sakamushi. I’d left the meat in a room that’s always cool, on a rock that was cool to the touch, but in this warm season, I was scared of it spoiling. Cautiously, I sniffed the meat.\n\n\n …Alright, it didn’t spoil. This is fine.\n\n\n “Maine, will this pot do?”\n\n\n “Yeah! Thanks, Tory. Since I seasoned this with salt and alcohol yesterday, we can get started immediately.”\n\n\n Since we don’t have any pepper to use as a seasoning, I had no choice but to give up on making it spicy. The actual recipe is very simple. You season the breast meat with salt and alcohol, lightly grill just the surface, then put it in a pot with more alcohol and cover the lid to let it steam.\n\n\n I thought that I should add the mushrooms I worked hard to gather up in the forest, to help bring out the flavor. I washed them clean, then lined them up on the cutting board. As I lifted my knife, Tory’s eyes snapped up.\n\n\n “Maine, stop! If you don’t put those in the fire first, they’ll dance!”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n No sooner than she had said that, she’d already started skewering the mushrooms from their base through the cap. Then, she sprinkled them lightly with salt and stuck them in the fire.\n\n\n Dance? The mushrooms would? Like… how bonito flakes flutter in drifting steam? I did not understand what she said at all.\n\n\n I doubtfully tilted my head to one side, trying to figure out what she meant. Tory pulled the lightly-toasted mushrooms from the fire, turned, and handed them back to me.\n\n\n “Now they’re okay,” she says. “Th… thanks…?”\n\n\n I decided that it was a strange turn of phrase, but if Tory said it was okay to use them now, then it must be okay. It’s just one more strange foodstuff on the pile: a mushroom that requires extra care in preparation. I cut them up, taking care not to burn myself on the hot mushrooms.\n\n\n “Mommy, can I use this alcohol for cooking? It won’t taste good if I don’t use enough of it, so I need about half a cupful.”\n\n\n “Alright, here you go,” she says filling it halfway full.\n\n\n I took the cup from her, then climbed up on a stool, stretching up on tiptoes to pour it into the iron pot. It hissed as it hit the hot metal, and I quickly covered the pot with a lid. When I heard it start to bubble, I removed it from the fire, cooking the chicken with just the heat still trapped in the metal of the pot.\n\n\n “You’re taking it off already?”\n\n\n “Yeah. I’m going to cook the meat for another ten minutes just using the heat in the pot. If I cook breast meat over a fire for too long, it’ll get all dry and hard to eat.”\n\n\n I heated the pomay sauce I made from the leftover soup and the fresh gnocchi, then mix them together. Tory’s salad was finished as well. Just like the previous day’s dinner, we used shredded breast meat as a topping. I’m very pleased with how that meat turned out.\n\n\n “Today’s dinner looks great too!”\n\n\n “We’ll have to be sure to thank Al.”\n\n\n Given the state of our budget, seeing so much food lined up on the table like that is a rare sight indeed. It’s a big deal to give someone a bird like that.\n\n\n “I’m home,” said my father, walking through the door with a big smile on his face and high expectations for dinner. “Another delicious looking meal today!”\n\n\n He told us about how much he was bragging about last night’s meal to his coworkers at the gate. I hoped that his overly-doting-father filter was making him massively exaggerate. I’d be much happier if it was all in his head. If it wasn’t, it’s going to make it a bit harder for me to go to the gates.\n\n\n “Let’s dig in!”\n\n\n “Whoa, amazing! This is delicious, Maine!”\n\n\n Tory’s eyes went wide as she took a bite of sliced-up poultry sakamushi. As soon as my mother had one mouthful, she smiled brilliantly.\n\n\n “It’s so simple to make, but this breast meat is so wonderfully tender. The flavor of the mushrooms has baked into it as well, it’s really delicious. Is it because we used good liquor, I wonder?”\n\n\n “I think so. The whole dish brings out the depth of flavor of the honey wine.”\n\n\n As soon as I said that, my father’s face went pale, and he dropped his fork with a clunk. He stood up and woodenly walked to the shelves, picking up the earthenware pot in which we store the alcohol. When he saw how much was missing from the small pot, his head suddenly dropped, and he looked like he was moments away from bursting into tears.\n\n\n “…M, my precious alcohol got…”\n\n\n Sorry, sorry. I mean, when I asked my mother for some alcohol, she said that it was something that he’d gone off and bought in secret, and that it would be such a shame if all of us couldn’t enjoy how delicious it was. She had a bit of a wicked smile on her face when she said that, and I thought it would be best to just follow along through that unusual occurrence.\n\n\n Since it was honey wine that I used, it had a different sort of sweetness than it would have if I’d used real sake, so once again it wasn’t really much like Japanese food. It was another completely different thing.\n\n\n Aaah, I really want Japanese food…\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Although words like “dance”, “struggle”, and “danger” come up when talking about some of the ingredients here, it looks like I’m able to adapt the kinds of cooking that I’m familiar to this new world without any problems. On other days, I made a tuber-based gratin, a pseudo-risotto out of a grain kind of like buckwheat, and a quiche made on top of the stiff dough of the multigrain bread, all of which were well-received.\n\n\n My family may like everything I make, but as for me, I can’t stand this at all. Even if I’m making Western-style food, we don’t have any spices or seasonings, and I’m starting to get very tired of the same sorts of flavors over and over again.\n\n\n At the very least, give me pepper! I’d be overjoyed with curry powder!\n\n\n There are still many tribulations ahead in my quest to better my culinary life.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1.

    "content": " \n\n\n\n After the bamboo exploded in the stove, I slip back into feverish nightmare, clutching my last remaining bamboo stick as I writhe in pain.\n\n\n The anger of having something I made burned up. The vexation of that anger not being understood. The despair of having struggled so many times to make a book, yet never finishing one at all. Spreading through it all, a deep and profound weariness that makes me just want to let go of everything.\n\n\n I don’t care about anything anymore. I no longer have the willpower to fight back.\n\n\n My mother burned my mokkan, When she burned the bamboo that Lutz had brought so I could make bamboo writing strips, though, I couldn’t summon up any of that anger.\n\n\n If only I was healthy. If only I was a strong, fit adult.\n\n\n If I were an adult, I could have skipped over papyrus, clay tablets, and mokkan, and gone straight to making rice paper. At least, if I was as strong as Tory and Lutz, strong and fit enough to do real work, I could at least try. With this frail body and these weak child’s hands, I can’t cut up the wood I’d need in order to make real paper.\n\n\n If I could just wait until I grew up, then maybe I could finally find my answer. But that’s so, so far away. And still, even though I’m talking about growing up, will I really grow as much as everyone else? Hobbled by my lack of strength, will I really grow?\n\n\n I can’t even hope for that.\n\n\n If everything is truly pointless, isn’t it okay for me to just surrender to this fever that rages within me? In a place where I can’t get a single book, is my fight to constantly endure living in this filthy, difficult world really worth it?\n\n\n Maybe it’s okay to just disappear.\n\n\n It was a fleeting, accidental thought, but the fever surged forth anyway, sucking me deeper and deeper. A feeling spreads through me, a vague desire to just stop thinking, to let the fever swallow me whole.\n\n\n I have only one regret. I won’t be able to apologize to Lutz.\n\n\n I won’t be able to apologize for the fact that I couldn’t use any of the bamboo, despite how hard he’d worked to find a nonflammable material I could use. The words he said to me when he’d left to go get me some bamboo drift through my mind.\n\n\n “This is just so you’ll introduce me to Otto! I’m paying you in advance, so you’d better get healthy! Got it?!”\n\n\n I haven’t fulfilled that promise. Even though he’d put in so much work for the sake of that promise, is it okay for me to just pretend it never happened and run away into the depths of this fever?\n\n\n Lutz did pay me in advance. It would be so simple to just fade away in this fever, but he gave me those bamboo strips, so I have to get better. I have to introduce him to Otto.\n\n\n I tell myself that it’s for Lutz’s sake, and try to push the fever back down. I’d much rather keep my promise than be eaten alive. I need to put my affairs in order. I don’t have time for thoughts like the one that flitted through my mind just a little while ago.\n\n\n That’s right, when I died in that earthquake, I wasn’t ready for that at a… aaaaaaAAA! What happened to all those things I’d never gotten around to doing! NOOOOOO! I don’t want this, I don’t want this! This is awful! I can’t just die here!\n\n\n All the regrets from my previous life that I’d thought I’d already buried come clearly flashing through my mind. “Even though I died, dying is too much!” I cry, leaping to my feet. Somehow, the fever’s been crammed back into a tiny little ball.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n I shoved my last life’s regrets back into the corner of my mind, and once again resolved not to think about them anymore. Now that I’ve finally been allowed to leave the house and accompany my father to the gates, I head to the duty room to meet Otto.\n\n\n “Excuse me, Mister Otto, I asked you a favor, but then I got really sick…”\n\n\n That’s right: while I was laid out with fever, Otto’s day off came and went, so he and Lutz weren’t able to meet like I had promised.\n\n\n “Squad Leader told me about how you were sick for five entire days. Are you alright?”\n\n\n “Yeah!” I say, smiling. “Thanks to everyone.” Otto frowns slightly, staring closely at my face. “Are you really okay? Your color’s quite off.”\n\n\n The fact that I’m looking kind of pale is actually not the fever’s fault. Rather, it’s because it seems unlikely that I’ll be able to make any paper.\n\n\n “Aaah~, it’s because there’s something really troubling me that I can’t figure out how to solve. …Mister Otto, can I ask what you’d do in my place?”\n\n\n “Huh? You want to ask what I’d do if I had your problem?”\n\n\n He glances at me briefly, his eyes round. Otto, during his time as a trader, must have accumulated so many experiences that I can’t even imagine. There’s a chance he might be able to think of something that I couldn’t.\n\n\n “Yeah. There’s a thing that I really want right now, but since I’m not healthy and not strong, I can’t make it myself. When I grow up, I think I’d be able to make it, but since my body’s like this, I don’t know if I’m going to be a healthy adult either, or if I’m even going to grow up as much as everyone else. Also, I really can’t wait all that time. Mister Otto, what would you do if you were me?”\n\n\n Otto nods along as he listens to my explanation. When I finish, he answers immediately, like he hardly needed to think about it at all.\n\n\n “If you can’t make it yourself,” he says, raising his eyebrows a bit, “why don’t you hire someone who can? Is that all that’s bothering you?”\n\n\n “Ah?!”\n\n\n The scales have fallen from my eyes. I’d never even considered the concept of hiring someone to get me the things I wanted. As expected of a trader. I wonder why, though. I was certainly aware of the concept that I could be hired by someone, but it had never crossed my mind that someone could be hired by me.\n\n\n “…That’s an amazing idea, but I don’t have the money for that.”\n\n\n “Well, if waiting until you do isn’t possible, then… Hm. If it were me, I’d find someone who could do it, then subtly lead them along until they offered to do it of their own free will. It’s not an easy thing to do, but if they do it without you directly asking, it won’t hurt your budget at all.”\n\n\n He truly is a former merchant. His explanation is so eloquent, and his smile so genuine, but he’s brilliantly wicked. I must have been happily lead along like that too, huh? My calculation abilities are quite high, but wasn’t I saying that it seemed really easy on the budget to hire an assistant on a salary of slate pencils?\n\n\n “……I’ll follow your example.”\n\n\n Taking someone who looks like they could do something, then leading them along until they do it on their own initiative… is it? That seems like it would be really difficult for someone like me.\n\n\n As I stew in my thoughts, Otto pats me on the shoulder and hands me my slate. He’s clearly telling me that the conversation’s over and that I should get to quietly studying.\n\n\n “Ah, that’s right! Maine, since you’re feeling better, how about we meet the day after tomorrow, on my day off? We could meet at, hmm… the central plaza would do nicely. How about we meet there around the third bell?”\n\n\n “I was just thinking about asking you. Thank you so much!”\n\n\n Out of habit, I jot down a memo in the corner of my slate, reminding myself that we’re meeting after the third bell. When I look back up, Otto is lightly rubbing his chin, smiling so widely that his eyes crinkle. For some reason, that smile sends a chill down my spine, like I’m looking at something dangerous. I reflexively straighten up in my seat and fix my gaze on him.\n\n\n “Ahh, if it’s someone you’re personally introducing to me, he’s got to be an interesting child. I’m looking forward to an enjoyable day off!”\n\n\n Did he just say “don’t bring someone boring, because it will ruin my precious day off”, or was it my imagination? Huh? I thought this was going to be a casual meeting so that he could talk about what it was like as a trader, right?\n\n\n I cover up the sudden turbulence in my heart with a big smile and a nod, then I let my gaze drop down to my slate. I’ve broken out in something of a cold sweat.\n\n\n This isn’t good. I barely have any time before this meeting, and I don’t even know what it’s really about!\n\n\n I grind my teeth with worry over how little time I have to prepare. We’re meeting the day after tomorrow, so I really have no time. I can’t ask, either; since I’m the one who is doing the introductions, I can’t really say that I have no clue what the meeting is really for. As I diligently practice my vocabulary, my pencil clacking against the slate, I frantically try to think of what the meeting could possibly mean.\n\n\n “Maine, we’re heading home already.”\n\n\n “Daddy!”\n\n\n It’s rather early for us to be heading home, but when he calls for me I gather up my things and leave the duty room.\n\n\n “Hey, Daddy. I told Mister Otto that I wanted to introduce him to Lutz, but what does an introduction like that mean?”\n\n\n “Lutz would be looking around for an apprenticeship at about this time, right? I think that he’d do well to follow his older brothers into their line of work, but does he want to become a merchant?”\n\n\n A job referral?! No, no, it’s not supposed to be that heavy! I mean, a child like me can’t possibly be part of anyone’s network.\n\n\n “He just said he wanted to ask some questions…”\n\n\n “Right, so there’s no doubt about it, he wanted a referral so he could ask about an apprenticeship. Your friend seems rather relentless.”\n\n\n “Relentless?”\n\n\n “Of course. When we talk about hiring an apprentice, we’re talking about looking after someone for a very long period of time. Even when you’re fully independent, that’s the kind of bond that can’t ever be completely broken.”\n\n\n This is far more serious than I thought. Lutz is not just looking to ask some questions. It seems that, since he wants to become a trader, he wants Otto, a former trader, to introduce him to somebody.\n\n\n Aaah, so in other words, the meeting the day after tomorrow is basically a job interview?! How did I have no idea this was going to be such an important meeting?!\n\n\n ***\n\n\n After we returned home, I asked my mother and father about apprenticeships in detail. The next day, I load my basket full of cargo before I head to the forest, now fully aware of how serious this meeting is going to be. On our way to the forest, I explain to Lutz about the sad fate of the bamboo strips, and let him know that the meeting with Otto was going to be tomorrow. He sighed when I told him about the bamboo, saying that it’s definitely possible to mistake bamboo for vanihitz, and when I told him about the meeting he thanked me with honest delight.\n\n\n When we reach the forest, everybody scatters to go about their gathering work. I, however, grab Lutz’s hand, and drag him over to the river.\n\n\n “Now then, Lutz. This is a good spot, so let’s make sure you’re nice and clean all over.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n Otto, because he was once a merchant, keeps a very tidy appearance. I think that it’s best for Lutz to give the best possible impression that he can on his first meeting. Since I help Otto with his job so frequently, I am well aware of how calculating he is, just like a merchant. If I were in Lutz’s shoes, I would want to show up to this meeting looking absolutely flawless. If he were to judge Lutz as without merit on their very first meeting, there’s no way he’d even refer Lutz to a shopkeeper, let alone a trader.\n\n\n “When you’re meeting people for the first time, first impressions are really important! Since we have time to prepare, it’s a really good idea to make sure we do everything right. If I were to judge you right now, based on what you look like, I wouldn’t think very well of you.”\n\n\n “Even if I wash up, though, I don’t think much is going to change.”\n\n\n It would be stellar if Lutz could borrow the nice clothes Ralph wore to his baptism, but I don’t know if Ralph lend them to him. Neither Lutz nor I have much in the way of clothing, so there’s not much we can do but wear our usual stuff, but if there’s anything that we can improve, I want to improve it. Despite his stubbornness, I take out my simple all-in-one shampoo and get ready start working on his hair, explaining to him about how much of an effect one’s appearance has on other people. I intend to polish him until he shines, so I lugged a bucket, some cloth, and a comb out with me to the forest. I don’t intend to just wash his hair, though; I want his whole body clean.\n\n\n I fill the bucket with water from the river and my simple shampoo, then I wash it through Lutz’s hair over and over, like I usually do with Tory’s. I keep talking with Lutz as I work, somehow feeling like some kind of hairdresser.\n\n\n “So, Lutz. When you said you wanted to hear about being a trader, you really meant you wanted to be a trader, right? And since you want to be a trader, you wanted to be introduced to one?”\n\n\n “Hm? Yeah.”\n\n\n I dry off his blonde hair with a cloth, which is now much glossier. It’s such a beautiful color of gold that I wouldn’t mind having it myself. As I comb it out, it only gets more radiant. Holding back my little bit of envy, I keep asking him questions.\n\n\n “So, Lutz, when you become a trader, what do you want to do? Just travel around?”\n\n\n “What’s up with you all of a sudden?”\n\n\n “You have to think carefully about it!”\n\n\n “Why?”\n\n\n “Mister Otto doesn’t know anything about you. You’re not being introduced by your parents or a relative who knows you super well, so you’re going to have to think of all of these answers yourself.”\n\n\n From what my parents were telling me yesterday, it seems like in this town a child’s parents do the introductions when the child starts doing an internship. For that reason, a child’s job winds up being somehow related to one of their parents’ jobs. For example, my mother works as a dyer, so she introduced Tory to one of her friends from work, and got her an apprenticeship as a seamstress.\n\n\n When a child has the same profession as their parent, they don’t tend to work at the same place, since it would be too easy for them to start relying on their parents too much. However, if the child enters a related profession, then their parents can rest easy knowing that their child is being supervised by someone they know, and the children work seriously because they know their parents will be hearing about it. It’s rare for a child like Lutz to want to work in a profession their parents are opposed to, and rarer still for them to be introduced by someone outside the family.\n\n\n “Mister Otto is being really gracious in meeting you tomorrow, but it’s not because he’s super nice! He used to be a merchant, so he’s a person who thinks of everything in terms of profit and loss. If you show up without having thought any of this through, he’s not going to meet you a second time, I don’t think.”\n\n\n Tomorrow’s meeting is a job interview. For an interview, you need to make sure your appearance is in order and that you know both what you want out of the job and what you think you can bring to it. If you don’t, there’s a good chance you won’t be taken seriously.\n\n\n “…How about you, Maine?”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n “If someone were to ask you why you wanted to be a merchant, could you tell them immediately?”\n\n\n Lutz scowls at me with pursed lips, perhaps because he couldn’t come up with his own answer immediately.\n\n\n “Yeah. I want to sell paper. If I can be a merchant’s apprentice, then I could find someone to teach how to make paper, then I could have them make it for me.”\n\n\n It’s all for my sake, because I want books. Until now, I’ve been thinking that I shouldn’t be relying on others, and I should do whatever I can to make something that I could reasonably substitute for books. However, at this point I am quite frankly at my limit. Now, what I want is for someone who can do all the labor, from beginning to end, while all I do is provide the knowledge. If I turn over the profits I’d ordinarily get for that information, I think I could find someone out there who would make it for me.\n\n\n “Paper? I thought you wanted books, though?”\n\n\n “You need paper if you want to make a book. And, you know, I don’t think there’s anyone else around here besides me who really wants books.”\n\n\n “If you’re the only person who wants to buy books, then you’re not going to be able to sell any, right?” he says, shocked.\n\n\n I nod, with a big smile. “Yeah! Selling books isn’t going to be that easy, I don’t think. However, paper… I think I can make it for cheaper than parchment, so I think I’d be able to sell it. At the very least, I think there might be a merchant out there who would take me on once I showed him how to make it.”\n\n\n “…Huh. You’ve really thought this through, Maine. I’ll have to think about it too.”\n\n\n “Since you’re only Mister Otto’s assistant’s friend, it’ll be really easy for him to turn you down. If you can clearly say what you want to do with yourself, though, and you can make them believe that it’ll be profitable for them, then won’t there be a merchant out there who’d take you on?”\n\n\n While Lutz sits, deep in thought, scowling at the surface of the river, I use the time to wash up the rest of his body. We don’t have the time to sit here and do nothing while we think.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Well before the third bell sounds, Lutz and I arrive at the town square, me looking like I always do and Lutz looking far nicer than usual. I had been hoping that Ralph would lend Lutz his nice clothing, but it seems that Ralph didn’t want them to get dirty and refused.\n\n\n “Hey, we’re meeting at the third bell, right? Aren’t we way too early?”\n\n\n “That’s okay! Being late would be absolutely fatal. Once we get there, we can sit and talk for a while, and it’ll be time for the meeting before you know it.”\n\n\n The temple rings its bell regularly, in intervals of somewhere between two and three hours. I’m sure that being late to a meeting in a world without actual timepieces isn’t as bad as I made it sound, but I want to avoid any sort of negative impression from having the two of us be late to a meeting we requested.\n\n\n “That reminds me, yesterday, my mom was all, ‘what did you do to your hair?’, and she made a really big deal about it!”\n\n\n With a deplorable look on his face, he tugs at a lock of his glossy blond hair. I understand exactly what his mother was thinking. If my son suddenly had smooth, shiny hair after a day out, I’d be curious too.\n\n\n “Beauty is always the thing a woman is most fascinated by, after all.”\n\n\n “I told her you did it, so she should ask you if she wants to know.”\n\n\n “What?!”\n\n\n I shrink back suddenly, my voice crying out in incredulity, a headache instantly forming as I realize that I’ll never be free of Carla’s unceasing barrage of questions once she gets a hold of me.\n\n\n “I’ll tell her how to make it so she can do it herself. I don’t have very much of it anymore.”\n\n\n “…Ah, sorry. If it’s that bad, you didn’t need to use it on me, you know?”\n\n\n “That’s okay. You’re always the one helping me out, after all.”\n\n\n I don’t mind using some of my simple shampoo on Lutz at all, since he’s been constantly assisting me, but I absolutely would mind giving it to Carla. After all, I’m already having to suffer with the fact that I can only wash my hair with shampoo once out of every five days and have to use plain water on the rest.\n\n\n “But, still…”\n\n\n “If it really bothers you, I wouldn’t mind if you helped me make some more. I’m way too weak, so I’m not very good at pressing oil.”\n\n\n “What, is that it?”\n\n\n As we talk, Otto comes into view near the entrance to the plaza. When he sees the two of us, he smiles broadly, but even from this far away I immediately realize what just happened.\n\n\n Ahh, this really was a test.\n\n\n Given that he gave such a fuzzy time as “around the third bell” while giving me that dangerous smile that put me so on edge, this really must have been a test to see whether or not we’d arrive well before the bell actually rang. Otto purses his lips just a little, then turns towards another part of the plaza and gives a big wave. Another man comes into view, and the two of them start walking towards us. Beads of cold sweat trickle down my spine, and I unconsciously grip Lutz’s hand tightly.\n\n\n “They’re here, Lutz. Remember, introduce yourself first.”\n\n\n “R… right.”\n\n\n Judging from how the two of them are talking quietly to each other as they approach, I know that this is Otto’s friend, a merchant. He briefly glances at me, and I meet his eyes. They gleam with a sharp light, and I feel like my value is being appraised.\n\n\n Nobody told me that Otto wasn’t going to be the only interviewer!\n\n\n Aargh, it’s Lutz’s interview, but I’m the one getting super stressed, here!"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Making Lutz wash up, despite his protests, and having him make a last-minute effort to think up answers to the questions he might be asked in the interview, was absolutely the correct decision. Otto and his friend both have meticulous personal appearances, a significant cut above the rest of the people coming and going through the central plaza. As I thought, it would have been much better if Lutz and I could have gotten our hands on our older sibling’s nice clothes.\n\n\n Their clothing design is strange… no, their clothing design isn’t what I’m used to seeing. The many layers of fabric draped over them show no signs of either stains or patches at all. This is not something I see very often at all in my daily life, where it’s only natural to use the barest minimum of cloth and thread at all times. Based solely on his clothes, I imagine that Otto’s friend is someone who makes quite a bit of money. His garments, his demeanor, that calculating look in his eyes, everything about him is vastly different than the shopkeepers I see in the town market.\n\n\n When I say he looks like a merchant who makes a lot of money, I do not mean that it seems like he’s the owner of an old, well-established shop. Rather, he moves with the force of the president of a venture firm in the middle of a tremendous rise. At first glance, he has curly, pale, milk-tea colored hair and gentle-looking features, but his red eyes overflow with self-confidence, and they glitter with the raw ferocity of a carnivorous beast.\n\n\n “Hey there, Maine!” says Otto. “And you must be Lutz?”\n\n\n “Good morning, Mister Otto. Yes, this is my friend Lutz. Thank you for taking the time to meet with us today.”\n\n\n I’m not entirely sure what the most suitable way to greet him is, so I tap my chest with my fist twice in a salute, like I always do. Otto returns the salute, so I think that I didn’t at least make a big mistake.\n\n\n “Good morning, sirs, my name is Lutz. It is nice to meet you.”\n\n\n Lutz seems very nervous, but he refuses to give in to the intimidation of their discerning stares, and he recites the unfamiliar greeting without stammering and without a quiver in his voice. The first hurdle has been cleared.\n\n\n “Benno,” says Otto, “this is Maine, the girl who works as my assistant. She’s my squad leader’s daughter. Maine, this is Benno, an acquaintance from when I worked as a trader.”\n\n\n “Mister Benno, sir,” I say, “My name is Maine. It is nice to meet you.”\n\n\n Despite the fact that I compulsively want to bow as I introduce myself, I don’t forget that it’s not customary in this culture to do so, and instead give him my best smile.\n\n\n “You’re quite polite!” says Benno. “I am Benno, nice to meet you.” He looks over to Otto. “…She’s quite well-mannered for such a small child.”\n\n\n “She’s not as young as she looks,” he clarifies. “She’s six years old.”\n\n\n I probably look somewhere between three and four years old. Benno frowns slightly, then the corners of his mouth turn up in amusement as he glances over at Otto.\n\n\n “…Your assistant’s a girl who hasn’t even been baptized?”\n\n\n “Ahh, well, how should I put this. I’m teaching her to read and write so that she can become my assistant in the future.”\n\n\n “I thought you said before that she was already working as your assistant, did you not?”\n\n\n “…Don’t worry about it too much.”\n\n\n As they banter harmlessly back and forth, I notice that there’s a lot of information being conveyed purely through subtext. Chills run down my spine. Are Lutz and I even capable of handling an interview with these people? What the hell. When he brought up that I haven’t been baptized yet, I got the keen feeling that he was intimating that I wasn’t actually capable of doing the work, and that Otto was simply going easy on me.\n\n\n With a dubious expression on his face, he stares at a spot just above my eyes for a little bit, then opens his mouth to speak.\n\n\n “I’m very curious about something that I’d like to ask about first, is that alright?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir, what is it?”\n\n\n “What’s that rod you have in your hair?”\n\n\n I see. Asking such a silly question after rejecting me would be hard, wouldn’t it? Is this man perhaps already intending to dismiss me?\n\n\n Forcing a smile onto my face, I quickly undo my hairpin and hand it over to him as he carefully studies me, seeming to get a lot of information out of every little move I make.\n\n\n “This is a ‘hairpin’. I use it to keep my hair in place.”\n\n\n Otto seems to be curious as well, so they study my hairpin closely, looking it up and down, turning it around, and giving it careful scrutiny.\n\n\n It’s just a stick, you know? There’s no gimmick or trick to it, you know?\n\n\n “…It’s just a stick, huh.”\n\n\n “Yes, it’s a stick that I had my father whittle for me.”\n\n\n “And you’re able to keep your hair in place with just this?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir.”\n\n\n I take the hairpin back from him, then put my hair back up into its usual style. I gather up the half-up part of my hair, twist it around the hairpin, spin it until it’s tight, then with a quick jerk fix everything in place. It’s something I do every day, so I’m very practiced at doing it.\n\n\n “Ohhhh… impressive!”\n\n\n Lutz and Otto stare at me with wide eyes. This is the first time they’ve seen me as I put up my hair like this. Benno touches my hair, frowning slightly.\n\n\n “Say, Maine. Your hair’s pretty impressive too. What do you put in it?”\n\n\n His touch may be careful as he studies my hair, but the discerning gleam in his eyes is breathtakingly sharp. Between the glitter of profit in his eyes and the ferocity of the women’s questions back on baptism day, I can clearly see that my simple shampoo could be quite the valued commodity.\n\n\n “It’s a combination of relatively common things, but the details are my secret.”\n\n\n “Boy, you use the same thing?”\n\n\n “Maine insisted on making my hair look nice yesterday…”\n\n\n Ah, Mister Benno, did I hear your tongue click just now? Did you think that it would be easy to get us to teach you how it’s made, since we’re merely children? How unfortunate. I’m not going to play my high-value cards in a little skirmish like that; Lutz’s interview hasn’t even started yet.\n\n\n Benno and I exchange smiles, mine sweet, his stiff. Otto lets out a little sigh, running his fingers back through his hair.\n\n\n “Well then, Lutz. You said that you wanted to become a trader?”\n\n\n The main question has arrived. Next to me, I hear Lutz’s breath catch as he gulps nervously. I sneakily reach over and squeeze his hand reassuringly, quietly cheering him on.\n\n\n You’ve thought about this long and hard since last night, right? Now is the time to stand tall, Lutz! Tell us of your ambitions, and seize your victory!\n\n\n “Ah, yes. I w―”\n\n\n “Give it up.”\n\n\n “Eh?”\n\n\n Lutz was stopped before he could even start telling us what he wanted. In my heart, I scream. He worked so hard to come up with that answer, at least hear him out! Otto, however, looks like he’s swallowed a bug as he looks down at Lutz.\n\n\n “Only an idiot would throw away his citizenship like that.”\n\n\n “…Mister Otto, what do you mean by citizenship?”\n\n\n The question slips out of my mouth before I even have time to think about it. This is the first time I’ve heard that word used here. I know that citizenship, in this context, would be the set of basic rights afforded to those who live in this city. Just like how you can still enjoy the rights granted to you by the Japanese constitution even if you haven’t studied them, there seem to be certain obvious rights granted to the citizens of this town. However, I have absolutely no idea what they could be.\n\n\n “It means the right to live in the city. It’s also something that records your identity. When you turn seven and go to the temple to be baptized, your name will be registered, letting you work in the city, get married here, rent a house, and so on. The ways you can interact with the city are vastly different when you do or do not have citizenship. Outsiders can register at the temple, be granted citizenship, and settle down here, but doing so is ludicrously expensive.”\n\n\n “Mister Otto, did you have to pay?”\n\n\n He nods. “Yes, that’s right,” he says, smiling bitterly, perhaps in recollection.\n\n\n Benno, next to him, points at Otto and laughs. “This guy sold everything he had so that he could stay here and marry Corinna!”\n\n\n “I wanted to open up a shop here and continue selling things here if I could, but buying citizenship was an enormous effort that left me nearly broke.”\n\n\n I don’t know how much money the average trader has saved up, but it looks like it’s not enough to cover buying citizenship, paying for a wedding, and opening a shop.\n\n\n “On top of that, a life on the road is vastly different compared to living in a town. Tell me, Lutz, do you have any idea what it means to live your life while riding on the back of a cart?”\n\n\n “…No,” he replies, slowly shaking his head.\n\n\n It takes only two hours to walk across this town from end to end, so children in this town move around almost exclusively by walking. Lutz might have ridden in a hand-drawn wagon before, but he’s probably never ridden in a horse-drawn cart before, and most likely has no idea at all what it’s like to actually travel by cart.\n\n\n “Let’s take water, for example. When you need it right now, where do you get it?”\n\n\n “From the well.”\n\n\n “Of course, right? But when you’re on the road, there aren’t any nice wells that are built for you. You’d have to start searching for places you can find water.”\n\n\n “There’s rivers…”\n\n\n When we go to the forest, we use the river as a source of water, so that’s the first thing that pops into Lutz’s head. However, when you’re on the road, you aren’t at all guaranteed to be traveling near a river. Plus, since paper is so expensive and hard to get, how many traders actually have maps to go by?\n\n\n “Lutz,” I say, “when you’re just starting out as a trader, you’re not going to know where those rivers are. There’s no way you’ll be able to follow the rivers all the time…”\n\n\n “It’s just like she says. That’s why traders generally travel the same routes all the time. When you do, you make friends and contacts in the towns you visit, you can deal in information, and you start to learn where you can find water and the safe roads to travel on. Then, you teach that to your kids, and those kids take those same routes on when you retire. When you spend your days riding in a cramped cart like that, there’s no room for another person in there. …Also, and this is the most important part, is where traders eventually end up. Lutz, do you know what a trader longs for, more than anything?”\n\n\n “…”\n\n\n “Citizenship.”\n\n\n “Huh?!”\n\n\n “They want to give up their difficult lifestyle, and someday settle down in a town somewhere. They want to open a shop in a town and conduct their trade in safety. That’s what a trader dreams of. You’re not going to find a single trader who’ll take you on when you already have citizenship. If you absolutely want to do it, then you’ll have to do it all on your own. There’s no apprenticeship program for traders.”\n\n\n If citizenship is every trader’s dream, then Otto’s already fulfilled his. It seems like he really wanted to open a store here in the city, but I don’t know why a merchant like him would give up on that and become a soldier instead.\n\n\n “Mister Otto, why did you decide to become a soldier?”\n\n\n “Wait,” interjects Benno “no, don’t… ngh!”\n\n\n Otto puts his hand over Benno’s mouth to silence him, then grandly, majestically states his answer.\n\n\n “It was all so that I can marry Corinna!”\n\n\n “Ooh,” I say, “I want to hear everything about this!”\n\n\n Benno, in a panic, tries to shush me. “I don’t want to hear anything about this, young lady.”\n\n\n Otto, however, starts his story, his eyes glittering. “That’s right,” he says, “this happened was just after I became an adult. I was passing through this town when I caught a glimpse of Corinna, and it was love at first sight! It was like an arrow through my heart, or a flash of divine inspiration, but all I could see in that moment was her. I couldn’t marry anyone else but her, I thought, so at that very moment I started to woo her.”\n\n\n “…Mister Otto, that’s unexpectedly passionate of you.”\n\n\n This former merchant, who hides his darkly calculating nature underneath a gentle smile, seems to be a passionate romantic. The color of his black tea-colored hair and his light brown eyes gives him such a composed, honest image that I never could have imagined he could pour out such passion.\n\n\n “She was just so charming that I couldn’t help it. So, I resolutely made my advances, but at first she rejected me. You see, she’s a seamstress famous for her excellent skills, and on top of that she treasures the bonds she has with everyone here. She told me that she couldn’t live her life on the road.”\n\n\n Ahh, of course. If you have a stable life, with enough skill and enough regular customers to earn a steady income, you won’t be able to abandon it all for an unstable life of travel. Plus, looking at it from Corinna’s perspective, wouldn’t a trader suddenly walking up to her and trying to woo her seem very suspicious? Surely she’d be wondering if that was some kind of con, wouldn’t she?\n\n\n I nod along intently as I listen while Otto’s love story starts to heat up. He starts putting more and more passion in his voice, and his gestures start getting bigger and bigger.\n\n\n “Corinna said she planning on marrying a man from this city, and a shock like thunder came crashing through my brain. The thought of Corinna marrying another man was completely unimaginable! After frantically trying to figure out what I needed to do, I immediately marched over to the temple and obtained my citizenship.”\n\n\n “Huh? Wait a minute. Weren’t you letting your passions run a little too wild?”\n\n\n I look over at Benno, wondering if Otto’s actions were at all normal by this world’s standards. Benno has his hand to his head, squeezing on his temples, an exhausted expression on his face.\n\n\n “…See, even a child can see it! On top of that, the money he spent on his citizenship was all of the money he had been saving to go back to the city where his parents lived and open up a shop, right?”\n\n\n “What?!”\n\n\n He then explains that if you purchase citizenship in the town where your parents had citizenship, the price would be reduced by more than half, so the rest of the money could be used to open up a shop. For a trader to spend so much time amassing enough money to retire from his uncertain existence and move up to owning a shop, then spontaneously spend it all in one go on a woman he had just met… those are not the actions of a calculating merchant, but of a wild stallion who has eyes for nothing but his beloved.\n\n\n “I wanted to open a shop in this town, but I didn’t have enough money left over to afford one, and I didn’t yet have any connections in this town that would lend me enough money. I had to quit my job as a merchant, then became a soldier in order to show Corinna my dedication to live in this town. I asked a favor of the squad leader who I’d made friends with after seeing him every time I came to this town, and he got me hired for a position that primarily involved a lot of paperwork. …By the way, when I bought my citizenship, became a soldier, and proposed, Corinna was shocked!”\n\n\n Well, uh, it is rather shocking. I don’t think a single young woman of marriageable age exists who wouldn’t be shocked if someone were to sell everything they have, buy a citizenship, and become a soldier just because she told him that she couldn’t live a life on the road. I want to hear things from Corinna’s viewpoint, whether she thought Otto should have reined himself in or whether her chest tightened as she wondered what about her could be so captivating. I’m absolutely sure her story is going to be very different from Otto’s.\n\n\n “I kept chasing after her for many days, until I finally married her, which felt a little like being adopted into her family. She was so cute when she laughingly told me she couldn’t help falling for me after all that time! And, now…”\n\n\n After that, he starts going on and on about how adorable his wife is. There was no stopping him. I really want him to not use the first-class sales pitch skills he honed during his career as a merchant when describing his wife. Lutz is left completely flabbergasted by the deluge of praise. I’ve heard of husbands so devoted that they’d never lay eyes on another woman, but I thought it was fathers who were so prone to exaggeration like this. These exaggerations, though, are pretty harmless.\n\n\n What should I do about this? I had no idea Otto was this kind of person.\n\n\n I look over at Benno, silently pleading for help. Our eyes met for a brief instant, then he clapped a hand on Otto’s shoulder and sighed lightly. He looks like he’s had practice at this.\n\n\n “Otto, you stopped talking about being a trader a while ago, you know! That’s enough about your wife, get back to the main topic.”\n\n\n “Ahem! Sorry. So, as I was saying, give up on being a trader.”\n\n\n I want to make a sarcastic quip about his use of “as I was saying”, but I force myself to keep my mouth shut. He may have gotten significantly derailed, but now I know that there’s no apprenticeship system for traders, the life of a trader is fraught with difficulty, the citizenship Lutz and I possess is extremely important, and that drowning in love is absolutely terrifying.\n\n\n After being so plainly told to give up, Lutz gloomily hangs his head, looking so sad as to be almost pitiable. He’d spent so long thinking about his reasons for becoming a trader, but before he could get a single word out, he was told that his dream was impossible. After being beaten over the head about how difficult a trader’s life is (and how awesome Otto’s wife is), it’s only natural to be so sad.\n\n\n “…Lutz,” says Otto, “this was Maine’s suggestion, but instead of becoming a trader, how about doing your apprenticeship under a merchant? You’ll eventually be able to leave the town on your own to go purchase supplies.”\n\n\n “Maine?!”\n\n\n Lutz raises his head abruptly, turning to look at me. Rage flares up in his green eyes, accusing me of having known all along that they were going to tell him he couldn’t be a trader.\n\n\n “I thought that you should really hear it from the mouth of an actual trader,” I say. “I’ve lived in this town all my life, so would you even believe me if I told you to stop?”\n\n\n “…Ah.”\n\n\n From the look on his face, I’ve hit the bullseye. He looks away, seemingly lamenting about how unfair life is.\n\n\n “When I asked Mister Otto about it, I thought that being a trader sounded way too difficult, so I started wondering is there was a job that would let you travel out of town that your parents wouldn’t object to. Also, I might have just heard about this now, but I think you should stop thinking about letting go of your citizenship so that you could be a trader.”\n\n\n “…I guess you’re right.”\n\n\n Now that he’s heard Otto say it, it looks like he’s really letting it sink in. The fanciful tales he heard from people traveling from out of town truly are entirely different from the harsh reality of being a trader.\n\n\n “Daddy told me that Mister Otto has connections to some of the merchants in this city, so I asked him if he’d be willing to introduce you to someone, if you wanted it. It’s your choice, though, you know?”\n\n\n “…Oh, wow. You’ve really thought this through.”\n\n\n Benno looks up, letting out a deep breath. I look up as well, watching him closely. If Lutz wants to be introduced to a merchant, then the opponent he needs to beat isn’t Otto. It’s Benno.\n\n\n “So,” he says, “it seems we’ve been introduced, but… kid, do you want to become a merchant?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir!”\n\n\n Lutz nods, and Benno smiles widely, his reddish-brown eyes narrowing. The light-hearted atmosphere from when Otto was bragging about his wife has completely blown away. Not a wisp of it remains. Benno looks down at Lutz like a carnivorous beast, his cruel eyes fixed on the opponent he will beat into submission.\n\n\n “Hmm! Well now, what will you sell? If you become a merchant, what kind of things do you want to sell?”\n\n\n “Um?!”\n\n\n It’s only natural to be asked questions about your aspirations during a job interview, but the ambitions that Lutz spent yesterday contemplating were all about being a trader. To be suddenly forced to spin those around into reasons for wanting to be a merchant’s apprentice instead is no trivial matter at all.\n\n\n “I’m asking you what you want to do when you become a trader, and if you can even do it.”\n\n\n “Um, I…”\n\n\n Eeek! This is a very high-stakes interview to be giving to a child who isn’t even old enough to be baptized!\n\n\n I want to say that he’s not being as cruel as he seems, but for a merchant, taking on another apprentice means incurring a lot of additional expense. Also, Lutz is only the friend of Otto’s assistant. Benno doesn’t have any obligation to take on such a large burden. If Lutz doesn’t show his willpower, his determination, his knowledge about what goods he might be able to sell, and his ability to be of some use to Benno, then nobody could possibly complain if Benno cuts off the conversation right now. From Benno’s standpoint, the fact that he agreed to this meeting is something that Lutz should be grateful for.\n\n\n “If you don’t have anything, this conversation is over.”\n\n\n Lutz drops his head slightly, chewing nervously on his lips. I don’t know if I should say anything. I don’t know if it’ll be a lifeboat for him, or a step down a painful path he shouldn’t tread, but it’s ultimately up to him. In a low voice only he can hear, I quietly ask him a question.\n\n\n “…Could you make my paper?”\n\n\n “Yeah.” “Hmm?”\n\n\n Lutz suddenly looks up, grabbing my hand and squeezing it tight. I can feel him trembling, but the firm glare he fixes on Benno burns with raw ferocity.\n\n\n “Of course I’ve got something I want to do! I’m going to make everything that Maine comes up with!”\n\n\n “Yeah,” I say, “he’s always been helping me.”\n\n\n “Maine can barely do anything by herself, so I’m going to do it for her.”\n\n\n Lutz, that was a great job. You said it perfectly. Benno’s eyes have gone wide.\n\n\n I haven’t the slightest idea if any of this happened because I was the one dragging Lutz along or if he was the one dragging me along, but if Lutz is going to take on all of the things that I can’t do, then I’ll take on all of the things that he can’t do either.\n\n\n Unlike Lutz, I already have plenty of experience with taking entrance examinations and applying for job interviews.\n\n\n I calmly look up at Benno, a smile on my face. I take a slow breath and let it out gently, getting my breathing in order, then open my mouth to speak.\n\n\n “I have an idea for a kind of paper that I’d like to sell, one that doesn’t use any animal skin. I believe that I can get its production cost down below that of parchment, so I think that it will be a very profitable good to sell.”\n\n\n As I talk, Benno’s face turns sour, like he’s swallowed a particularly bitter bug. When he turns to look at me, his eyes glow with an even more ferocious light then he did when he was staring down Lutz.\n\n\n “…You want to become a merchant as well?” he asks, in a low voice that almost sounds like a growl.\n\n\n “Yes, sir!” I nod, smiling brightly. “It’s my number two aspiration, though.”\n\n\n Next to Benno, Otto doubtfully tilts his head to the side.\n\n\n “Is your number one aspiration doing paperwork at the gate?”\n\n\n “No, sir, it’s to become a 'librarian’.”\n\n\n As soon as I say it, all three of them look at me in unison, identically dubious expressions on each of their faces. It looks like they really didn’t understand that word.\n\n\n “…I’ve never heard of that.”\n\n\n “I mean that I want to manage the books in a place that has a lot of them.”\n\n\n After I finish my simple explanation of a librarian’s job, Benno suddenly bursts out in riotous laughter.\n\n\n “A… ahahaha! There’s no way you can do a job like that if you’re not a member of the nobility!”\n\n\n “…Really? I thought that was the case.”\n\n\n Those damn noblemen.\n\n\n If it’s a fundamental truth that it’s only the nobility that has books, then I think it’s only natural for the librarian who manages those books to be a member of the nobility as well. I never had any real expectations about it, but this reminder of my difference in social status is still really irritating.\n\n\n “Even so, a paper that isn’t parchment, huh… Do you have any of it?”\n\n\n When he glances back down at me, his eyes are bright and alert. Most likely, thoughts of how much profit could be made if I really could make paper without using parchment are tumbling around in his head.\n\n\n “I haven’t made any yet, sir.”\n\n\n “Then don’t be ridiculous.”\n\n\n He may be telling me not to say ridiculous things, but there’s no mistaking that his interest has been piqued. I think we’re just one word away from finding some common ground. I smile even wider.\n\n\n “If actual paper is what you want to see, then we’ll make it. Our baptismal ceremony is summer of next year, so by spring we’ll have a prototype of my paper design, and then I hope that you’ll be the judge of whether or not we can actually make it.”\n\n\n “…Alright then.”\n\n\n I have somehow managed to wrangle an extension out of Benno, despite the fact that he came here with the full intention of dismissing us outright. This truly is an amazing victory.\n\n\n “Thank you very much, Mister Benno.”\n\n\n “We still haven’t settled on anything yet.”\n\n\n “Even so, I’m grateful that you’ve given us the chance to prove ourselves.”\n\n\n All that’s left is up to Lutz’s persistence. I think that he’s going to work extra-hard, knowing that my job is at stake as well. It may have been sudden, but I can’t help but smile at the fact that it suddenly looks like I’ll be able to obtain real paper.\n\n\n “Lutz, let’s do our best!”\n\n\n “Yeah!”\n\n\n Lutz and I also convey our gratitude to Otto, with big smiles. Thanks to him, Lutz has given up on his dream of becoming a trader, and has taken his first step towards becoming a merchant’s apprentice. Out of all of the outcomes I’d considered, this is by far the best one.\n\n\n “Mister Otto, thank you very much for introducing us to Mister Benno.”\n\n\n “You made my day off very fun! Looking forward to seeing you at the gates next time!”\n\n\n “Me too!”\n\n\n We somehow managed to get passing marks from Otto as well. I let a big sigh of relief. I pick up on the hint in Otto’s last remark, realizing that it’s time to break up the meeting, and start to leave the town square with Lutz.\n\n\n …Ah, I almost forgot.\n\n\n I stop walking after just one step, then turn back around to call after Otto and Benno as they walk away.\n\n\n “Um! Mister Otto, Mister Benno, I have something to ask!”\n\n\n “Sure, what is it?”\n\n\n “Do either of you know of a sickness that can cause a fever that can suddenly spread throughout your body, then shrink back down again?”\n\n\n Between Otto, who has been to many places in his life, and Benno, who has many connections around the area, it’s possible that one of them might have heard of something like the fevers I have.\n\n\n “It felt like it got big enough to swallow me whole, but then I frantically fought against it and forced it back into a tiny shape. I’m sorry that this is such a subjective description…”\n\n\n “Who knows? I haven’t heard of it,” says Otto, loosely shaking his head.\n\n\n Benno looks off to the side, glances down at the ground, then slowly starts shaking his head too.\n\n\n “…I don’t know.”\n\n\n If this is something that even those two don’t know about, then I don’t think I can find someone who knows anything more. My illness must really be rare, then.\n\n\n …Could this disease actually be extremely dangerous?\n\n\n As I entertain this touch of anxiety, the meeting comes to a close."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n My name is Otto. I am the man who loves my beautiful, adorable wife Corinna the most in the whole wide world.\n\n\n Her hair is the color of cream, and the irises of her eyes are gray. Each of her pale colors adds to the gentle, pure atmosphere that floats around her. The bridge of her nose may be long, but she’s so cute when she worries about how the plumpness of her cheeks makes her look a little bit baby-faced. She’s so lovely when she laughingly tells me that she doesn’t know what she’s going to do about me. She smells great when I hold her close, her huge breasts squishing up against me. She’s the best.\n\n\n I’ll shout it from the top of the world! My Corinna is the best woman in the world!\n\n\n Today, at the behest of my helper Maine, I met Lutz, a young boy who said that he wanted to become a trader. I gently hit him with the harsh truth of reality, leaving his dreams smashed into tiny pieces.\n\n\n “I’m home, Corinna!” I call out. “Benno’s with me too.”\n\n\n “Welcome back, dear. …So, even after bullying children that haven’t even been baptized, you can still come home with a smile like that.”\n\n\n “She’s so cute even when she’s pouting!”\n\n\n I unintentionally blurt out my inner thoughts. Corinna looks at me in shock, then lets out a long sigh. This is a regular sort of shock, so I just shrug my shoulders and explain myself. I really had no intention to bully those children, so it’s not like what I did could be considered bullying. All I did was talk to a child who still believed in fairy tales and told him about how reality truly works.\n\n\n “I didn’t have a choice. There’s nothing good about becoming a trader, after all. Sure, I had to shatter his dreams completely, but it was for his own good.”\n\n\n “I guess so, but…”\n\n\n Corinna looks down at the ground with her gray eyes, her eyebrows knitting together in concern and pity. Seeing my Corinna worrying about another man, even if he’s just a child, makes my heart tremble, though just a little bit.\n\n\n “You’re such a kind person, Corinna. You’re so worried about a child you haven’t even met…” I grab onto her shoulders and hug her close, just ready to kiss her.\n\n\n “You’re blocking the door, Otto,” says Benno, crossly, from behind me. “Actually go in the house, please.”\n\n\n Corinna, looking a little flustered, shoves me off to the side and shows Benno in.\n\n\n “Come in, big brother! …You look quite depressed, are you maybe feeling guilty about rejecting those children?”\n\n\n Deep lines are carved between Benno’s knotted eyebrows, and not a single trace of his usual affable demeanor can be found in his expression at all. Contrary to what Corinna is thinking, Benno actually didn’t wind up rejecting Lutz, so, of course, his gloomy mood has nothing to do with guilt at all.\n\n\n “No, no, Corinna, it’s not that,” I say. “He tried to drive away Lutz after the boy said he wanted to become a merchant’s apprentice, but Lutz wouldn’t be driven away. Maine set forth a few conditions, and Benno actually accepted them. She completely turned the tables on him. That’s why he’s depressed.”\n\n\n “Otto…” says Benno in a low, warning voice. I ignore him and head into the house with Corinna.\n\n\n He must be feeling the effects of being done in by a child. This is great. Savor this, Benno. This is how I feel every time Maine does something shocking to me.\n\n\n As we walk towards the parlor, I embrace Corinna from behind, and kiss her lovely cream-colored hair over and over. Benno clenches his fist, telling us that we should wait to do that until he’s not around. Even though I want to be mad at him for interrupting our couple’s time, but if I were to actually say that in front of Corinna, she’d tell me to cut it out immediately, so I bite my tongue.\n\n\n The parlor is typically where Corinna entertains her customers. She works hard to keep it very clean so that she can use it whenever a customer may happen to come by. In the center of the room stands a round table, unlike the one in the dining room. Four chairs are set around it. Since the use of cloth for things besides just clothing is the mark of a wealthy individual, this parlor has much more cloth in it than any other room in the house. For instance, display shelves are arranged along the right wall, showing the patterns that Corinna can make, On the left wall, a vividly colored tapestry has been hung, sewed together out of leftover cloth.\n\n\n I don’t usually come into this room, since I rarely need to, but it’s fun for me to just look at it, since it’s decorated with Corinna’s handiwork. I sit down at the table opposite from Benno, broadly grinning at him.\n\n\n “Well! That really was an unexpected turn of events! I never would have thought that Benno would make a compromise…”\n\n\n “What? Benno did?” asks Corinna, her gray eyes going wide. “Otto, you have to tell me everything!”\n\n\n She’s so cute when she pesters me with those wide eyes. Also, after she sits down on the chair next to me, she scoots it just a little bit closer. She really is adorable.\n\n\n It’s rare for Corinna to pester me like this, so I cheerfully recount the day’s events to her, applauding Maine in my heart for her efforts.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n When I finish with my story, Corinna looks at her brother, her eyes wide.\n\n\n “He made himself look as good as he could before he met you, then showed up in the plaza to wait for you long before the bell actually rang… Benno, weren’t you losing that fight from the very beginning?”\n\n\n “Shut up…”\n\n\n Benno’s mood is only growing more and more foul. Even as he pours the liquor Corinna had brought out down his throat, the knot between his eyebrows doesn’t loosen even the slightest. Both maintaining at least a minimum level of personal grooming and making sure you arrive earlier than the person you’re requesting a favor of to avoid making them wait are obvious, basic things for a merchant. Benno thought that he could see how prepared Lutz actually was based on whether or not he could do those basic things, but Lutz actually cleared both of those hurdles.\n\n\n It was, however, probably Maine’s doing.\n\n\n From expression that flashed across her face the moment she saw us enter the plaza, I can’t think of anything else. Today’s victor was clearly Maine, and, thanks to that, I got to see a scene where Benno was forced to make a compromise.\n\n\n “Well! Thanks to Maine, today was much more fun than I thought it was going to be!”\n\n\n “You’re talking about your squad leader’s daughter, right? The one you said was extremely bright.”\n\n\n “Yeah, that’s right. Even though it’s been nearly half a year since I made her my assistant, I still don’t have a good grip on her. She’s so peculiar that I can’t help but wonder how a child like her could have been raised.”\n\n\n As a trader, I went to many different places and met with many different people of many different social positions, and Maine’s peculiarities stand out from all of them. Benno, my companion for the day, has similar experience; as a merchant, he knows many people of note. If you think of my breadth of knowledge as wide, but shallow, Benno’s is narrow, but deep.\n\n\n “Hey, Otto,” he says. “What was that?”\n\n\n “I told you already, that was my assistant.”\n\n\n “No, I get that, but don’t lie to me: was that really a soldier’s daughter?”\n\n\n “No doubt about that at all… but I, for one, think it’s strange.”\n\n\n “How so?” asks Corinna, head tilted to one side in wonder.\n\n\n Usually, when I tell her about my day, I mention a few things about Maine, like how she’s smart, or how she’s frail, and so on, but this is the first time I’ve ever described her as strange. After all, I think she’s so strange that you can’t truly understand just how strange she is unless you see her for yourself.\n\n\n “First of all, her appearance is unusual. She keeps herself so tidy that you’d never think she was ever a soldier’s daughter. The clothes she wears aren’t all that different than what you see on other children like her; old, worn-out, and patched in places. Her skin and hair, though, are so clean that they shine. The squad leader is a man that looks just about the same as all the other soldiers, but neither of his daughters are slightly dirty like he is, and their hair is glossy.”\n\n\n “Surely their mother must be helping them take care of their skin and hair, then?”\n\n\n Corinna was raised as the daughter of a wealthy merchant, so even if she’s seen how poor people live, she really can’t truly grasp what it’s really like. Putting effort into taking care of your skin and hair requires time, money, and supplies. Poor people have none of those things in abundance at all.\n\n\n “…I last saw their mother this past winter, but she didn’t seem like she was taking the initiative to put in that kind of effort. She is, though, so beautiful that she’s really wasted on the squad leader.”\n\n\n During a clear winter’s day, Maine stayed at the gates for a while so that her family could collect paru. When her mother came to pick up her daughter, I didn’t get the impression that she was remarkably tidy. All I really noticed was that she looked a lot like Maine, and that she was beautiful.\n\n\n “Ohhh, is that so?” says Corinna, an amused twinkle in her gray eyes. It’s very rare for me to compliment other women. “Of course, you’re the best woman in my whole wide world, and that will never, ever change!”\n\n\n “Yes, yes, dear, that’s quite enough. …So, Benno, did Maine seem strange to you too?”\n\n\n Benno puts his glass down, leans back in his chair, and looks up at a beam holding up the ceiling. Slowly, he takes a breath.\n\n\n “Yeah. Her hair, the color of the night sky, was so glossy that it almost seemed to glow, her skin was an untarnished white, and her hands did not look like those of someone who lives a life of manual labor. Her teeth were white, too. The beat-up dress she was wearing matched her so poorly that it almost looked forced, no matter how I looked at it.”\n\n\n “Wait… hair so glossy that it almost seemed to glow?! What did she do to make it do that?!”\n\n\n “Huh?” I say, blinking in surprise. “Corinna, but you’re already so beautiful just as you are!”\n\n\n “Quiet, Otto! I’m talking to my brother.”\n\n\n To women, it seems that the shininess of one’s hair is a matter of utmost importance. It’s rare for Corinna to express this much interest in something that’s not related to sewing.\n\n\n “It looked like she’d put something in it, but she didn’t tell me what exactly she’d used.”\n\n\n “Benno, she said it was a secret,” I added.\n\n\n “Otto, do you think you’ll be able to ask her about it?” asked Corinna.\n\n\n “…Yes, but she’s probably going to be on guard from now on, so I don’t think I’ll be able to get an answer.”\n\n\n Corinna wants to know what Maine does to her hair. For Corinna’s sake, I’ll ask Maine about it the next time I see her, even though I’m certain it’s useless.\n\n\n “Aside from her hair,” I say, “I think that the reason her hands are so clean is because her body is so small and weak that she can’t be of much help around the house. The whiteness of her skin is probably because she gets sick at a moment’s notice, so she doesn’t go outside very often and thus doesn’t get a lot of sun. Honestly, she’s only really started to be healthy enough to go outside since this spring.”\n\n\n “…Now that you mention it, we cancelled the meeting last time because she had a fever, didn’t she?”\n\n\n I nod, unable to keep off my face a faint expression of irritation as I remember how jumpy and distracted the squad leader was during his daughter’s five-day fever.\n\n\n “So, in other words, Maine’s appearance is due to her weak constitution?” asks Corinna. “That’s not quite enough to call her strange, isn’t it?”\n\n\n It seems that Corinna has decided this isn’t that big of a deal after hearing all of this. She shrugs her shoulders, looking like she’s rapidly losing interest.\n\n\n Benno shakes his head. “No, it’s not just her appearance that’s strange. What stood out to me was her posture and her speech. …Those were something that she couldn’t have mastered without very good upbringing at home. Otto, don’t tell me that she had such a strict upbringing because her parents are disgraced former members of the nobility?”\n\n\n I wouldn’t draw that conclusion about the squad leader’s family circumstances. If you look at the rest of Maine’s family, it’s quite obvious whether or not they have any connections to the aristocracy.\n\n\n “The squad leader has one more daughter, who is perfectly ordinary. Her hair is unusually glossy and her skin is relatively clean, though, but that’s it. She’s not so far beyond her peers as Maine is.”\n\n\n Benno nods slightly, then looks over to Corinna.\n\n\n “Corinna,” he says, “that girl doesn’t just look strange. She had the courage to maintain eye contact when I was staring her down, was crafty enough to protect her advantages with regards to the secret behind her hair, was able to feed me a wild bluff without anything to back it up, and even negotiated terms… none of those things are things I’d expect from a child that hasn’t even been baptized.”\n\n\n “A child that doesn’t flinch away under your glare, Benno?!” asks Corinna, her eyes wide. “That child is strange. Without any doubt, that child is strange.”“\n\n\n When Benno starts to lay on the coercion, his eyes grow sharp like a predator’s. Benno is the eldest son of the family and Corinna is the youngest daughter, so when they lost their father while Corinna was still very young, Benno stepped in to raise her in his place. He scolded her a lot whenever she got immature, and the fact that even to this day she still averts her eyes is a sign of how scary Benno can get.\n\n\n \"A~ah, her memory and calculation ability are also amazing!” I say. “Now that I think about it, when I gave her my slate, she surprised me again. She picked up the slate pencil and started writing immediately, without anyone even needing to show her how to hold it! It’s almost like she already knew how to write.”\n\n\n “Did she maybe learn by watching you?” asks Corinna, her head tilted to the side in thought.\n\n\n She glances down briefly, noticing that my glass is empty, and pours me another. I take a mouthful, hesitating about how I should answer. It’s true that I showed her how by example, but…\n\n\n “Writing isn’t something that you can just simply start doing after watching someone else, especially with how smoothly she was writing right from the start. I train all of the new apprentice soldiers in how to write every season, so I know how difficult it is to learn. When they first start, they can barely draw a line, let alone write a single letter.”\n\n\n “Ahh, that’s right…”\n\n\n Corinna has instructed quite a few apprentices of her own in a variety of things, so she knows how rare it is for someone to be able to learn how to do something just by watching.\n\n\n “Her calculation abilities are also very strange. She said that she learned how to read numbers when her mother took her to the town market, but surely it’s impossible for someone to learn how to do math just from being taught the numbers, right?”\n\n\n “Well,” says Benno, “the apprentices who come to me already know a little bit of math. It’s something their parents teach them, you know?”\n\n\n The children who become apprentice merchants are generally the children of merchants themselves, so it’s not uncommon for the children to know how to read, write, and do basic math by the time they go through their baptismal ceremony. When I was a child, traveling with my trader parents, they taught me math and writing. Maine’s calculation abilities, however, are on an entirely different level.\n\n\n “It’s not just a little bit of math. The south gate’s financial report calculates the quantity and costs of all of the equipment that we’ll need over the course of the year, right? These aren’t the tiny numbers you see at the town market, these are very significant sums once you start adding them all up, and she was able to just start doing those calculations like it was an everyday sort of thing. Also, she didn’t even need to use a calculator1, she just worked everything out on her slate.”\n\n\n “…That really isn’t something that you make an assistant do, usually? Letting a kid like her work on your financial report.”\n\n\n I shoot a glare towards an amused Benno. For the sake of shocking them, I then tell them something that I’ve never told anyone before.\n\n\n “Don’t tell anyone I ever said this, but I think I could trust her to do about seventy percent of the financial report on her own.”\n\n\n “…What?!”\n\n\n “…Seventy percent… Otto…”\n\n\n They’re even more surprised than I thought they were going to be. Their faces have gone rigid and their eyes have gone wide with shock. I can’t help but start laughing.\n\n\n “And it’s only seventy percent because there’s vocabulary words she doesn’t know yet! And it only gets worse. When I was away from the office, she was able to perfectly handle what needed to be done when someone came through with a letter of introduction from a nobleman.”\n\n\n That had been shocking. I had been in a meeting that day, where my squad leader was constantly, restlessly, nervously fidgeting in his seat because he was missing the baptismal ceremony for his beloved daughter. When that let out, Maine came to me to give a report: a merchant carrying a letter of recommendation from a low-ranking member of the nobility was waiting for processing.\n\n\n Essentially, when a visitor comes through with a letter of introduction from one nobleman to another, we want to accommodate them as quickly as possible, validating their information and letting them through into the town. Even if they’re commoners, they should still be treated like low-ranking noblemen. That day, the meeting I was in had been called by a high-ranking nobleman. Of course, when having to decide what to prioritize, a high-ranking nobleman’s request comes before that of a low-ranking nobleman’s. However, if we were to mistreat a guest, then they’d get furious at how rude we were being, brandish their low-ranking noble’s letter of introduction like a shield, barge into our meeting, infuriate the high-ranking nobleman present, and make an enormous mess out of everything.\n\n\n Instead, Maine directed the merchant, who was not a nobleman, to the waiting room for low-ranking noblemen, tickling his sense of self-conceit, then explained the fact that the ranking officials were in the middle of a meeting called by a high-ranking nobleman. Then, immediately after the meeting finished, she came to deliver a report so that there would be no misunderstandings with the leading private and the merchant could be swiftly processed through. She did all of this by instructing a new recruit what to do, despite the fact that he was so flustered that he was practically useless. It was perfect.\n\n\n “What an amazing girl, isn’t she?” says Corinna.\n\n\n “Amazing, hmm… more like strange. Weird. However, I think that Squad Leader Gunther hasn’t paid much attention to her peculiarities. From his perspective, I think he just sees her as his adorable, frail little girl. If I hadn’t told him that I wanted her to be my assistant, nobody would have noticed her excellence, would they? Even now, he says things like ‘my little girl is so clever!’ without, I think, actually realizing how abnormally clever she really is.”\n\n\n “It’s a good thing he’s so slow, isn’t it!” laughs Otto. “If she weirded him out, it wouldn’t be strange at all for him to throw her away!”\n\n\n Corinna frowns, sadly. “Don’t joke about things like that. I don’t even want to imagine it.”\n\n\n “It’s alright, Corinna,” I say, with a comforting smile. “Even if the squad leader did get weirded out, and if she were to be thrown out, then maybe Benno could adopt her instead. After all, she’s so brilliant that she was able to turn the tables on him completely.”\n\n\n Corinna softly smiles at that. Yep, as I thought, Corinna is way cuter when she smiles.\n\n\n “Hey,” says Benno, lightly drumming his fingers on the table, “do you think that girl’s going to be able to make that paper?” As he looks at me, I notice that his eyes once again are filled with a merchant’s shrewd gleam.\n\n\n “A kind of paper that isn’t parchment, was it? I think she can definitely do it.”\n\n\n “You’ve got a lot of faith in her, huh?”\n\n\n “Hmmm… earlier, she told me that there was something she wanted immediately, and she really wanted to make it, but she didn’t have the strength to do it herself… could it be that? I told her that she could always try to convince someone to do it for her if she couldn’t do it herself. If Lutz is going to be her hands and feet, moving as she directs, then she’ll be able to complete it.”\n\n\n She told me that she regretted how little strength and stamina she had, which means that she must already know how she wanted to make it. Then, she declared that she was going to be able to make it, as if she knew her probability of success was high. Most likely, that wasn’t a bluff.\n\n\n “…If she actually does this, it’ll turn the town’s market upside down. How am I going to handle this girl?”\n\n\n “Are you thinking of taking her on yourself?”\n\n\n From what Benno is saying, it sounds like he’s thinking about taking on not just Lutz as an apprentice, but Maine as well. It’s just a guess, but when I say it out loud, Benno’s eyes go wide.\n\n\n “Of course! You thin I could let a something like that fall into someone else’s hands?! Just what kinds of things is she capable of making by herself? That 'hairpin’ she wore, whatever product she uses in her hair, paper that isn’t parchment… and that’s just the things that I know about from today! She has to have even more ideas secreted away. She is a calamity that could singlehandedly throw the entire market into chaos.”\n\n\n “Wait a minute! That’s my apprentice! You can’t just steal her like that!”\n\n\n I don’t think that Benno’s claim is wrong, but I do have objections. I’ve spent the last half-year training her, raising her so that she can unleash her full potential on the year-end budget reports. There’s no way I’m just going to stand idly by as Benno snatches her away from me. Benno, however, lets out a snort of laughter, puckering his lips into a smug sort of smile.\n\n\n “She said that becoming a merchant was her number-two aspiration. She has no interest in being your assistant! You’ve only been training her for, what, half a year? Find someone else, Otto.”\n\n\n “Where am I going to find someone else who can be trained into usefulness in half a year?! Maine can think of things, Lutz can make those things, so then there’s no problem at all with her continuing to work at the gate, is there?!”\n\n\n I’m especially not going to surrender her during budget season. Benno and I glare at each other with all our might, willing the other to capitulate. I grab my cup, and pound back the rest of my drink.\n\n\n “Of course there is!” Benno roars. “I’m going to make her contract with the merchant’s guild. I can’t risk her getting snatched up by someone else.”\n\n\n “Think about her health, then! Working with the merchant’s guild will be impossible!”\n\n\n “Her health?”\n\n\n Benno deflates, like he’s suddenly exhausted. I see an opening, and immediately hammer home my point.\n\n\n “Her constitution is so weak that she’s almost shockingly feeble, right? Getting her to do any sort of work that involves her body would be impossible!”\n\n\n “…She’s that frail, huh?”\n\n\n “Yeah, when she went to a nearby village on pig-slaughtering day, she suddenly collapsed. The squad leader brought her back to the night duty room so she could rest. That was the first time I really came into contact with her. I thought that she was going to be fine, since she was in a warm room with a fireplace, so I gave her a slate so she could kill some time and left her alone. Not even one bell later, she got a fever and collapsed again.”\n\n\n “Uh?”\n\n\n I needed to stand watch that day, so I’d left her next to the fireplace in the night duty room for a while. When I came back in to check on her, she’d collapsed due to fever. When the squad leader came to pick her up, he told me to pay it no mind, because it happened all the time. Her extreme feebleness seems to be something her family just kind of accepts by now.\n\n\n “When spring came around, it was awful for her. She couldn’t even walk on her own from her house to the gate.”\n\n\n “Wait… to the gate?” asks Benno.\n\n\n “No matter where your house is in this town, making it to the gate isn’t really very far, you know?” adds Corinna.\n\n\n The city is surrounded on all sides by a wall, so the town itself isn’t actually all that big. Even going at a child’s pace, going from the west gate to the east gate shouldn’t take more than one bell’s worth of time.\n\n\n “That’s right, the squad leader’s house isn’t particularly far from the south gate. However, that didn’t do Maine any good. She’d get exhausted about halfway there, and after the squad leader carried her the rest of the way in his arms, she was laid out in the duty room, unable to move, all the way until noon. After that, she’d usually have to stay in bed for another two or three days.”\n\n\n “Hey, that… is she really alright? Won’t she just die if she has to do any work?”\n\n\n I can’t at all say that I’m not afraid of that. In particular, Benno is always full of vigor, and his workplace is so busy that it’s always brimming with raw energy. I can’t imagine that being a place where Maine would be fit to work.\n\n\n “Well, by the time spring was halfway through, she was finally able to make it all the way to the gate, and she needed to stay in bed far less than before. When spring was over, she was able to make it all the way out to the forest, but I think she still doesn’t have the strength to do any ordinary work. So, I was thinking that she should work at the gate, where doing paperwork is her sole responsibility and she can take care of herself…”\n\n\n “Mm…”\n\n\n I’d said she had a weak constitution, but it seems like Benno hadn’t thought that she was quite so frail. He furrows his brow as he contemplates. He might be figuring out how to change course now that he knows that all of his previous plans aren’t going to work out for him. If that’s the case, then I should probably give him one more piece of information.\n\n\n “Lutz is the one who’s always been keeping an eye on Maine. Whenever she got separated from the rest of the children coming back from the forest, Lutz stayed behind to escort her all the way back. The squad leader gave him some pocket money for it, but I think he did it because of his strong sense of loyalty and responsibility.”\n\n\n Lutz is at that age where most boys just want to run around wildly, but he’s instead always accompanying Maine. That’s not something that just anyone could do. Incidentally, I don’t have any strong sense of loyalty like that; there’s nobody to whom I’m devoted besides Corinna.\n\n\n “…I can’t fathom all of that girl’s abnormalities, but that boy is pretty strange too,” says Benno.\n\n\n “Hm?”\n\n\n Benno rubs his chin lightly, looking like he’s just remembered something. Gradually, an unpleasant expression creeps onto his face.\n\n\n “It wasn’t just the girl who was able to stand up to my stare and clearly state their own opinions. Moreover, most people would ordinarily see a sickly girl like that as trouble, but he seems to treat her like he’s her guardian? He stood in front of her, like he was trying to protect her from me. Despite that, though, as soon as she started negotiating with me, he stepped back like it was only natural for him to do so.”\n\n\n “Yeah, now that you mention it…”\n\n\n Just like Benno said, after he clearly made his declaration, he handed the reins over to Maine as she made the proposal. This doesn’t seem to me like the usual sort of protector/protectee relationship. What kind of relationship could they possibly have?\n\n\n “There aren’t very many kids who think about when they should step forward or when they should let someone else do the talking. On top of that, even though I couldn’t get any information out of the girl, she tells him everything so that he can make things for her. If I only had the girl, I wouldn’t be able to get information out of her, so it would be meaningless. If I only had the boy, then the girl would find someone else to make her things for her, so that would be meaningless too. It’s much better to keep those two as a set.”\n\n\n I can’t help but smile when I see the sharpness of Benno’s merchant’s intuition. He didn’t just notice Maine, he also sized up how useful Lutz was, and after meeting the two of them just once, he so clearly noticed all of those things about them. He’s as quick-witted as they come.\n\n\n “You’ve got a keen sense of smell as always… The squad leader seems to put a lot of trust in Lutz as well. He seems to be the person who has the greatest influence on her. He’s there for her right when she collapses, and he can prevent her from running amok to chase things outside her reach by skillfully helping her out.”\n\n\n “Hmm, if he’s able to confidently state that he’ll make everything that Maine can come up with, then he must have something to back that up.”\n\n\n Lutz had said something about how Maine was always like that. There’s probably even more things that Maine has done that I’m not even aware of.\n\n\n “I think they’ve probably made some other weird things together, probably. Didn’t they mention something called 'clay tablets’?”\n\n\n “…Weird things? Damn, I have no idea what kind of things they could be making! Regardless, those two are a single set. I’ll take them both. I’ll surrender neither of them to you.”\n\n\n With a single stroke, the subject was settled. Corinna stands up from her chair, leaving to go start preparing dinner. She leaves behind a lamp for the table, a small cask in case we wanted to refill our drinks, and some snacks to go with our liquor. As I gnaw on the slightly salty jerky, I look over at Benno pouring himself another drink.\n\n\n “Hey, Benno. Do you have any idea of what Maine was asking about, that wriggling sort of fever inside her body?”\n\n\n “…”\n\n\n “I’ve never heard of a fever that thrashes around inside your body like that, feeling like it’s going to consume you.”\n\n\n From his reaction when Maine asked the question, I think he might have some inkling of what might be happening, and from his reaction now, I think he really does know something. His eyes are raised, just a little bit, as if he’s worried about whether or not he should say anything. After spending a while in contemplation, he mutters something in a voice that’s almost too quiet to hear.\n\n\n “It might be… the devouring. I don’t have any proof, though.”\n\n\n “…The devouring? What’s that?”\n\n\n “It’s not an illness. It’s where you let too much mana build up in you with nothing to use it on. It eats you from the inside, then you die.”\n\n\n “Wh… what?! Isn’t mana something that only the nobility have?”\n\n\n My eyes fly open as soon as I hear that rare word. Mana is not a thing that commoners have. It’s a mysterious and powerful force. It’s not something that’s seen frequently, so I don’t know much about it at all, but it’s said you can change the course of nations if you have enough of it. That’s why those who possess mana are the nobility, governing the country at the top.\n\n\n “…It’s not common, but there are people outside of the nobility who have mana. However, the magical implements needed to release that mana are very expensive, so it’s more accurate to say that only the nobility have the ability to properly use their mana.”\n\n\n Benno is quickly rising through a company with connections to the nobility, so his knowledge about the workings of this country is much deeper than mine.\n\n\n “Huh! Maine has mana. I wonder if that’s why she’s so strange?”\n\n\n “Didn’t I just say that I have no proof? If it’s the devouring, though, that would explain why she’s so small for her age and why she collapses so frequently.”\n\n\n “Is mana so hazardous?”\n\n\n I had thought that mana was a wondrous, useful, but mysterious thing, but if Maine’s weakness is the result of magic, then I wonder if it’s something dangerous as well.\n\n\n “If this somehow really is the devouring… yeah. If it’s the devouring, and she can’t release that mana, that girl is… going to die very soon.”\n\n\n “Wh–?!”\n\n\n An image of Maine’s doting father flashes into my mind, and I’m hit with a feeling like a bucket of cold water was dumped over me. I stare at Benno in shock. From the serious expression on his face, this doesn’t look like any sort of joke or friendly banter.\n\n\n “It seems that mana builds up in someone as they grow up, and it starts to devour their heart. There are many commoners who don’t have access to magical implements who just simply die before they’re even baptized.”\n\n\n “Is there anything she can do?”\n\n\n If anyone knows of a good solution to this problem, it would be Benno. As I plaintively ask for advice, he combs his fingers back through his hair, then lets out a sigh.\n\n\n “If she had the backing of a noble, then they could lend her a magical implement and postpone her death. …However, she’d effectively be theirs until she died. She’d only be living for the sake of using her power for that noble. Between dying surrounded by her family or living her entire life as a noble’s pet, I don’t know which I would rather choose.”\n\n\n “…”\n\n\n There was no salvation in anything he just said. To be honest, I have no idea which of those two I’d pick, either. I don’t want to die, but I also am deeply concerned that being a nobleman’s pet for life would be equally awful.\n\n\n “It’s a somewhat different story if you can keep the built-up power pinned down with your willpower. A child, though, doesn’t have the sheer force of will to be able to keep that up indefinitely. …I wonder how that girl will do?”\n\n\n “…”\n\n\n Just looking at Maine, I can tell that she has much more willpower than other kids her age. However, I don’t know if even she’ll be able to hold down her mana long enough to keep the devouring at bay. She seems to be keeping it in check for now, but if her mana keeps growing as she does, then I don’t think anyone could have any idea about when she might finally reach her limit.\n\n\n “Otto, don’t look so serious. We still don’t actually know if it’s the devouring. Look at it this way: if it really was, she’d be very close to death. Do you think she’d be able to walk around outside if that were actually the case?”\n\n\n “I… guess so…”\n\n\n A tiny bit of relief and a heavy pile of anxiety simultaneously crash through my heart.\n\n\n That’s right, Maine has seemed close to death countless times. She may be able to walk around outside now, but that was the result of her enormous struggle during the spring. Before that, I hear that she really wasn’t able to go out like that.\n\n\n Is she really going to be okay? I don’t know whether I should tell the squad leader about this or not.\n\n\n Inexpressible emotions tumble around in my chest, and I down the rest of my drink.\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. The word Otto uses is indeed the word for “calculator” (計算機), although he’s referring to the wooden counting device he used a few chapters ago. In modern English, we say calculator to refer to an electronic calculator, but it still does actually mean “a device that calculates”."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n I’m going to make washi.1 My circumstances have finally come together to let me do that. On top of that, it’s not something I’m going to make, but something that Lutz is going to make for me. As a step forward in his job search, of course. Right now, I’m soaring, like a figure skater leaping in the air to spin in a full circle… no, a circle and a half!\n\n\n Don’t you dare snark about the idea of me jumping! It’s hard in this body!\n\n\n “Eheheheh. Heheheh.”\n\n\n “Maine, I’m glad you’re in a good mood, but… you’re kinda getting a little too excited! Aren’t you going to get sick again?”\n\n\n “It’s not like I can help it! We’re going to make paper, you know? We can actually make paper, you know? And, if we make paper, then I can make books! Woohoo!!”\n\n\n Now that books are finally almost in my grasp, how could I possibly not get excited? As I make my way home, practically jumping with every step, Lutz lets out a sigh, like he’s at his wits’ end.\n\n\n “…Maine, sure, we’re going to make it, but… how exactly are we going to do that? I definitely have no idea. Are we going to need tools? Can we really actually do this?”\n\n\n Sighing, Lutz grumbles out his objections. In an instant, I come crashing back down to the real world.\n\n\n …That’s right. It we don’t make all of the tools ourselves, we have nothing!\n\n\n I’m pretty sure I know the process for making washi. I even remember the names of all the tools we need. However, when it comes to making those tools, I might have read a few books about the sorts of things those obsolete craftsmen used, but I can’t actually remember the fine details. If I don’t have the tools, I won’t be able to make any paper.\n\n\n …Whoa, our first step is to make the tools, huh… Immediately starting to make paper seems pretty impossible. Aaargh, once again, my modern knowledge just isn’t quite good enough!\n\n\n “…Hey, Maine. You just got really quiet. Don’t tell me that, after all of that, you can’t actually make it?”\n\n\n Lutz has a look of extreme worry on his face, so I emphatically shake my head.\n\n\n “Don’t say that! I definitely know how to make paper. It’s something I’ve been wanting for a very long time. But, I don’t have the strength to cut up enough wood, I still don’t know how to use fire, and I can’t crush the fibers like I need to. I couldn’t ask you to make it for me before, because that would have been too selfish…”\n\n\n “I told you I was going to help you out, so I would have been fine with that…”\n\n\n Lutz pouts, looking a little bit chagrined. I’m happy he’s so willing to help, but making paper is going to be very physically intensive work. It’s going to be on a level far above helping me dig up some clay or helping me cut some wood down to size.\n\n\n “Um, Lutz, all I can do is teach you how to do it. It’s not like the things we’ve been doing before, where I can do them myself but you helped me out, this is going to be something where you do everything by yourself, from the very start to the very end. Do you still want to do it, if it’s like that?”\n\n\n “Of course. I told you: you come up with things, I’ll make them.”\n\n\n Lutz immediately nods his head, but I need more confirmation. I can’t help but think that he might be getting carried away.\n\n\n “That’s the thing, Lutz. We have to start all the way back with making the tools first. Can you stick with that?”\n\n\n “…You’ll be helping too, right?”\n\n\n “Of course, I’ll do whatever I can!”\n\n\n As I say that, I start thinking. Even when we’re just getting started making the tools, I’m going to have to figure out what kind of tools we’re going to need to make the tools. While I’m at it, I should try searching my house for anything we could use as a substitute. I might make my mother mad again, but we’re going to have no choice but to find substitutes for anything that we don’t have the wherewithal to make ourselves.\n\n\n “I’m going to write down a list of all the tools we need, and try looking for things we can use for those. If I can’t find any, we’re going to have to make them, though… Lutz, I’d like you to search for wood that we can use to make paper.”\n\n\n “We can find all the wood we need in the forest, right?”\n\n\n “That’s true, but I don’t know what kind of wood is suitable for making paper.”\n\n\n I know that plants like the paper mulberry, Oriental paperbush, or ganpi are suitable for making washi, but I don’t know what trees in this world would make good paper.\n\n\n “Ummm, so, wood that would be easy to use in paper would have long, durable fibers. They’d need to be sticky, too, and easy to bond together, and we’d need to be able to extract a lot of them… and so on, but I don’t actually know how exactly to spot what kind of tree has long, durable fibers.”\n\n\n On top of that, a paper mulberry’s wood is only suitable if it’s less than a year old. I remember reading that after two years the fibers start to stiffen and become very difficult to use for making paper.\n\n\n However, I can’t tell if a tree is one or two years old just by looking at it.\n\n\n “…You’re telling me to do something complicated like that, but I don’t know how to do it either.”\n\n\n “I guess you’re right. For now, I know that there’s soft wood and hard wood, but wood is softer when it’s younger, right?”\n\n\n “And then it gets harder as it gets older, yeah.”\n\n\n Lutz, having more experience than me, knows much more about wood than I do after all. For me, every kind of wood is difficult to cut, but Lutz knows what kinds of wood are easy or hard for him to cut, so it seems he can tell the difference between the softer and harder woods.\n\n\n “Well, there’s paper we could make that uses either bamboo or bamboo grass, and there’s pros and cons to doing that, but for now, since I think we can make paper out of other kinds of vegetation, we should probably focus on a paper that’s the easiest to make for now, right? Plus, if we’re going to commoditize this, that’s all the more reason that we need to pick a wood that’s easy to use.”\n\n\n “Huh…”\n\n\n Lutz nods slightly, mumbling to himself about woods that might be easy to use.\n\n\n “If we can find one, it would be even better if we could find trees that we could cultivate, so we could make acquiring the raw materials even easier, but we don’t know what kinds of trees are easy to cultivate, right?”\n\n\n “No, trees that are and aren’t easy to grow are pretty different. There’s definitely trees that can be easily grown.”\n\n\n “Really?!”\n\n\n I gnash my teeth at how low Maine’s XP total is after having never gone outside. I’ve only been able to go out to the forest since a month ago. I can’t even cut any wood right now, let alone pick what kinds of wood we should be using.\n\n\n “Alright, I’ll leave finding the wood to you, Lutz. I want to test a lot of different types and compare their pros and cons, so try coming up with a few kinds of soft-ish wood. After that… I want to find some ‘sunset hibiscus’.”\n\n\n “What the heck is that?”\n\n\n “The thing I’m thinking of is the root of that tree, but I don’t know if there’s anything like that around here. What I want is a tree that has a goopy, sticky sap… a fruit would do too, I guess. Do you know of any?”\n\n\n Lutz ponders for a moment, but nothing seems to come to mind immediately.\n\n\n “No…, I don’t think so.”\n\n\n “We’re going to be using it as a glue to stick the plant fibers together, so there has to be something.”\n\n\n “I’ll try asking someone who knows a lot about the forest.”\n\n\n “Alright, then! I’ll go and work on remembering the process and writing down all the tools we’ll need to make it happen. After that, I’ll start figuring out how we’re going to make everything.”\n\n\n By the time we’ve finished laying out what we’re each going to be doing next, we’ve arrived back at my house.\n\n\n “We’re here,” says Lutz. “Alright, let’s do our best!”\n\n\n “Yeah!”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Just making paper seems daunting, but the work of developing a prototype that could actually be turned into a salable good looks like it will require a lot of patient work. As soon as I returned home, I went straight for my slate. What I need to do now is try my best to remember the entire process involved in making washi and write out a list of all the tools I think we’ll need.\n\n\n The first step of the process is to harvest the trees or plants that we’ll use as raw materials. Lutz has a knife that’s kind of like a machete, so we don’t need anything else in particular here. Right, next step.\n\n\n When using paper mulberry, you need to steam the dark-colored bark off of the wood first, I think. If that’s the case, we’ll need a steamer. Since I haven’t seen our family use a steamer, if we happen to have one in the kitchen, I’ll be able to borrow it. I quickly search through the kitchen, but don’t find anything. Well, I haven’t tried to drag out any steamed recipes yet, so it’s no surprise that we don’t have a steamer. I add “steamer” and “pot” to the list on my slate. Right, next step.\n\n\n When the wood is steamed, we immerse it in cold water, then immediately skin off the outer bark while the wood is still hot. In other words, it’ll be best if we don’t have to go far from where we do the steaming to the river, but since we already have knives, we don’t really need any other tools. Right, next step.\n\n\n Neither letting everything fully dry out nor stripping off the white bark after exposing it to the river for a day requires any particular tools. Since we have a knife, we can make do. Right, next step.\n\n\n Then, we boil the white bark with ash, making it soft, then remove the excess. In other words, we need a pot and some ash. We can use the same pot that we needed in order to do the steaming, but getting the ashes is going to be difficult. I’m pretty sure my mother isn’t going to give me any, and I don’t know if boiling the wood will produce ash in a sufficient quantity. I add “ash” to the list on my slate. Right, next step.\n\n\n Then, we expose it to the river for over a day again in order to remove all of the ash, then leave it out in the sun to whiten it. Then, we remove all of the chips and knots. This is, generally, all physical labor. We don’t particularly need any tools here. Right, next step.\n\n\n Then, we beat the fibers until they have a consistency like cotton. Here, we’ll need some sort of rectangular timber that we can use for that. We should be able to make this out of either fresh wood or firewood. I add “rectangular timber” to the list on my slate. Right, next step.\n\n\n Next, we thoroughly mix the beaten fibers with water and the sunset hibiscus sap, then spread the resulting pulp on a special frame and let the water drain out. Mixing everything together will need a bucket, tub, or some other kind of bowl. After that comes the wooden frame with a removable bamboo mat, called a suketa, we’ll need in order to spread everything out. I think our suketa is going to be our number-one problem. I add “tub” and “paper frame” to the list on my slate. Right, next step.\n\n\n Then, we remove the mat from the frame, then transfer the drained paper to a drying bed. We let these stacks of paper dry on their own for a full day. I add “drying bed” to the list on my slate. Right, next.\n\n\n After that, we slowly apply pressure to the paper using either weights or a clamp to wring the last of the water out. After pressure is applied, we leave everything as-is for another full day, by which point the stickiness from the sunset hibiscus sap will have completely disappeared. I wonder what we could use for weights? Certainly, there’s the big stone weight we use for pressing oil, but is Lutz able to use that? For now, I just add “weights”.\n\n\n When we’re finished pressing the paper, we carefully peel it from the stacks on the drying bed one at a time, then stick it to another board. I add “flat board” to my list.\n\n\n Then we let it dry in the sunlight, remove it from the board when it’s dry, and then we’re finished.\n\n\n “Hmmm, now that I’m thinking everything out, we’re going to need a lot of things, huh…”\n\n\n The things we need: steamer, pot, rectangular timber, ash, tub, paper frame, drying bed, weights, and a flat board. Also, the raw wood and the sunset hibiscus sap.\n\n\n I’ve seen photos and illustrations of the process, so I can generally remember how everything fits together, but since I’ve never actually done it for myself, I don’t know any of the finer details. In our pulp, for example, what ratio of fibers to water to sap are we going to need? However, I recall watching a TV show where a particularly un-pop-idol-like pop idol went to a rural village and made some paper, and if a pop star can do it, then there’s no way that I can’t do it too.\n\n\n I need to remember more details about that program. Memory, do your best! …Well, hmm, that pop idol… was borrowing someone else’s tools, right? She didn’t have to make her own? And she had someone guiding her through the process, didn’t she? Rrrrrrgh.\n\n\n It’s not just like I only have theoretical knowledge. I have indeed personally made paper before: in home economics class once, we made a sheet of recycled paper the size of a postcard out of a milk carton. I think it’s better than nothing at all, but it’s certainly not something I can actually rely on.\n\n\n For now, let’s try taking on the production of a postcard-sized sheet. It’ll be easier to build the tools at a small scale as well, and when we’re experimenting with different kinds of wood, small batches are better to make than large.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “So, Lutz,” I say, “how about we start making the steamer first?”\n\n\n In Chinese cooking, they use a round wooden basket to steam food. Making something like that would be very difficult, but making a four-sided wooden box shouldn’t be quite so hard. I sketch out the design on my slate and show it to Lutz.\n\n\n “Making it should be really simple, but do you have any nails?”\n\n\n “Uh?! Can’t you… put notches in the wood and join them together with those?”\n\n\n “What are you talking about?”\n\n\n Making the tools has hit a snag. We don’t have the tools we need to make the tools.\n\n\n We may be able to cut wood to size, but we don’t have nails. Plus, nails here are not priced such that a child could buy them if they decided they wanted to use some. Plus, although we have the tools to cut wood, we don’t have any of the smaller implements we’d need for any fine work.\n\n\n It would be great if I could just borrow my dad’s tools, carve out some joints, and put everything together like an old-school carpenter, but there’s no way I have enough knowledge of that kind of skilled labor to actually make use of it. Incidentally, although Lutz can do many things for me if I just give him an explanation, I can’t call any of it skilled labor.\n\n\n Nails are something people use in their day-to-day life, so there’s no way we wouldn’t be able to go to a hardware store and just buy them. The problem is our purchasing power. All of our options are suddenly closed.\n\n\n “What are we going to do, Maine?”\n\n\n “Um, I’ll consult with Otto. He’s familiar with things like market prices and tradesmen, so I might be able to get nails if I help out…”\n\n\n Since I can’t even do any labor for my family, I have no choice but to go to the one place where someone will actually pay me for my efforts.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, I go to the gates and ask Otto about it.\n\n\n “Mister Otto, I have a question… Um, do you know how much nails tend to cost? Also, if you know a tradesman that sells them cheaply, I’d really appreciate it if you could introduce me to them…”\n\n\n “…Why nails? I don’t think you’re going to be able to make use of them, Maine.”\n\n\n That’s right. I don’t have enough strength to actually use a hammer.\n\n\n For someone who used to ask for slate pencils and ink to suddenly start asking for nails must be incomprehensible to him. As he tilts his head to the side in wonder, I sigh, then start to explain.\n\n\n “I want to start making the tools I’ll need to make paper, but I don’t actually have the tools I’ll need to make those tools.”\n\n\n “Ahahahahaha…!” Otto bursts into laughter, slapping the table as he laughs wildly.\n\n\n “It’s not funny!” I say, pouting at him. Of course, just the other day, I harshly declared to Benno that I was absolutely going to make it by spring, so for me to immediately turn around and say that I can’t even start on the tools might actually be really hilarious. For me, however, it’s a really serious matter.\n\n\n Otto wipes a tear from his eye as he calms down, a wide grin spreading across his face. I can clearly see that this is the slightly menacing smile of a calculating merchant. As he chuckles pleasantly at me, I’m suddenly very much on my guard.\n\n\n “If you teach me how to make whatever it is you put in your hair, how about I finance your nail purchases?”\n\n\n The value of what he’s asking for does not at all match what he’s offering. This is an absurdly huge ripoff. If Otto were to then let that information slip to Benno, then I would lose one of my most important cards that I could use against him. The price of that is far too high.\n\n\n “…Just for some nails, I can’t tell you how to make it. When I think about Benno’s reaction the other day, I think it might be something very profitable.”\n\n\n “…You’ve got good eyes,” he mutters, with the tiniest gleam of admiration in his eyes.\n\n\n As I stall with a vague sort of answer, I frantically start to think. I’ve got no other rope to cling to besides Otto’s, so if I lose him, I’ve got nothing. I have to come to some sort of compromise here.\n\n\n …Why would Mister Otto be so interested in my simple all-in-one shampoo?\n\n\n Otto, unlike Benno, is not a merchant. Therefore, I don’t think he wants to bring it to market as a new commodity. It might make sense if he wanted to get Benno indebted to him.\n\n\n …Otto is a comparatively neat person, but he doesn’t seem to be the type to care enough about his appearance that he’d go to the trouble of making something just for it. If I really had to say it, the people who’d want to do that would be women… his wife?! Is it his wife?!\n\n\n “…Mister Otto, it’s too much for me to tell you how to make it, but if you wanted to exchange goods, I’d be okay with that.”\n\n\n “Yeah?” he says, raising his eyebrows a little bit.\n\n\n Based on his look of interest, it seems like learning my methods might not actually be the important thing here. I fix my gaze on my tiny chance of victory and take another step forward.\n\n\n “…Ummm, that’s right. I can teach Miss Corinna how to use it, and show her how to make her hair smooth and glossy. I could just give you the product, but it would be useless without the instructions, so that’s what I can offer you.”\n\n\n “Sounds good to me. It’s settled, then!”\n\n\n Otto nods in agreement, looking like he didn’t even give it a second thought. I had thought that bringing up Corinna would be my most effective move, but I didn’t think that such a simple thing would take me quite that far.\n\n\n “Well then,” he says, “come over to my house on my next day off. Let’s make the exchange then, alright?”\n\n\n “Alright!”\n\n\n Just like that, it was decided that I’d bring my simple all-in-one shampoo to Otto’s house on his next day off, then play beautician (a shampoo-only beautician) for the day.\n\n\n I breathe a little sigh of relief at having somehow managed to secure some nails, but my own stock of shampoo is already almost entirely gone. On top of that, because this shampoo is a consumable good if you can’t make more of it, from now on it’s very likely that Otto will insist on making more trades in the future.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Lutz, I got us some nails.”\n\n\n “Seriously? Wow, Maine, you’re really amazing, aren’t you?”\n\n\n “Yeah, I’m going to get some in exchange for giving Otto some 'simple all-in-one shampoo’, but… I don’t have much of it left. Would you mind helping me make some for me today?”\n\n\n “Sure, sounds good.”\n\n\n Better yet, if I make a little more of it to put aside, why couldn’t I use it as a source of additional fundraising?\n\n\n “If we had a little more time, we could gather melil to use for this, but in this season, rio is the best fruit for it.”\n\n\n Lutz and I gather rio fruit from the forest, then go back to my place to squeeze the oil out of it. Lutz still can’t use the big stone weight to press it down, so we smash it out with a hammer. I take the freshly-squeezed oils and throw various herbs in one by one.\n\n\n “Hmmm!” says Lutz. “That’s really simple to make, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “That’s right. The important part of this is the kind of oil you use and the kinds of herbs you mix it with. So, Lutz, even if we’re going to be selling the finished product in exchange for the things that we want, we can never show anyone how it’s made.”\n\n\n “Why?”\n\n\n “Since it’s so simple, once you show someone how to do it, they can make it themselves, right? You won’t be able to trade with them ever again, you know?”\n\n\n “Ah, okay! I get it.”\n\n\n I take a portion of the completed shampoo, put it in a somewhat small container, and hold it out for Lutz. He looks down at it dubiously, head tilted to one side.\n\n\n “I don’t need any, though? Maine, you’re the one getting money and buying things, so you should hold onto that.”\n\n\n “This is your share after making it, Lutz. How about you use it to make Mrs. Carla happy? Hasn’t she been pestering you about what you did to your hair?”\n\n\n After I made Lutz’s hair look good to prepare for his interview with Otto, his mother started persistently assaulting me with questions. I haven’t met her since then, so I’m sure that she’s turned her questioning on Lutz.\n\n\n “Oh, thanks a bunch! You’re a lifesaver, Maine.”\n\n\n With a happy look, he takes the container from me. I grin broadly at him, imitating Otto’s smile.\n\n\n “Mrs. Carla is a very forceful woman, so you have to make sure that you don’t let her get the secret of how to make it out of you. This is good practice for giving someone something without telling them how it was made. When we become merchants, we’re going to have a whole lot of things that we’re going to need to keep secret, after all.”\n\n\n “…I really want to practice on something easier, though…” he says, smiling dejectedly.\n\n\n I still don’t have those nails in hand. The road to washi will be a long one.\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. Washi is a kind of paper that was made in Japan, using primarily manual methods."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The invitation to Otto’s residence is a formal invitation from Corinna, delivered to me through Otto. It’s a thin board on which words have been written.\n\n\n “This really isn’t something I should respond to by myself,” I tell him. “If I don’t ask my mother first…”\n\n\n It is probably very strange for a child such as myself who hasn’t yet been through their baptismal ceremony to receive a written invitation like this. Wouldn’t this ordinarily be something addressed to one’s parents? That would mean that my parents would be the people who’d decide if I would actually attend.\n\n\n Otto raises his eyebrows slightly at my remarks, then shakes his head. “Out of your entire family, aren’t you the only one who can really read? On top of that, this isn’t something you can refuse. If you did, there’s a chance that your mother and your sister would suddenly see their work dry up, after all.”\n\n\n “What?! Wh… what are you saying?!”\n\n\n Corinna’s parents run a successful company, and she herself is quite skilled, so she must be a fairly influential member of the tailor’s guild. Based on the various explanations I’ve been given, if Tory’s seamstress apprenticeship is like being a part-timer, and my mother’s work at the dyery is like being a line manager, then Corinna can be thought of as being an executive.\n\n\n Hierarchical societies are scary. I can’t turn this one down. Got it.\n\n\n This, though, isn’t an invitation from Corinna, but one from Otto, so my father might be able to reject it using his own authority. This is very complicated.\n\n\n “Besides,” says Otto, “I thought that now would be a great chance to study written invitations, too.”\n\n\n “Oh, I see! Thank you very much.”\n\n\n With Otto’s help, I look over the invitation, learning about both invitations themselves and how to reply to them.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Did you just say a written invitation from Madam Corinna?! What? Seriously?! Why?!”\n\n\n “She heard about my ‘simple shampoo’ from Otto, and wants to try it for herself.”\n\n\n “Well, I’ll be!”\n\n\n When my mother saw me return home bearing an official written invitation, she flew into a huge panic. I try asking her if I should decline after all, but in her excessive panic her eyes go wide with rage.\n\n\n “Turning it down would be unthinkable! We have to be polite!”\n\n\n “Okay! I’ll be careful.”\n\n\n Somehow, this seems less like an invitation, and more like an official summons.\n\n\n After that, my mother frantically starts making me a brand-new apron. It seems that going to Corinna’s dressed in my usual clothes would not be proper. As she works, she warns me about every breach of etiquette she can think of, so that I won’t accidentally be impolite. All I had planned to do was teach Corinna how to use my shampoo, but it’s somehow turned into this huge uproar.\n\n\n “You’re so lucky, Maine… You’re going by yourself, even though I’m the one who made it…”\n\n\n “Mommy, can Tory go with me too?”\n\n\n “Absolutely not! She doesn’t have an invitation.”\n\n\n Although I’m the one who thought up the simple shampoo, Tory’s been the one doing the manufacturing up until now. I think she’s more than qualified to come along with me, but since bringing an uninvited guest along with you is rude even here, Tory is going to be stuck at home no matter how jealous she may be.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Otto and I have arranged to meet in the central plaza at the ringing of the third bell, just like last time. On top of my usual clothes, I put on the brand new apron my mother made for me, and head off with my father towards the plaza. I bring my tote bag with me, into which I made very sure to put a little jar full simple shampoo and a comb.\n\n\n When we arrive, Otto is already waiting near the fountain. My father promptly turns me over to him.\n\n\n “Squad Leader,” says Otto, “Don’t worry, I’ll take proper care of her. Now, Maine, shall we?”\n\n\n “Yep. See you later, Daddy!”\n\n\n “Yeah.”\n\n\n After waving farewell to my father, Otto starts walking towards the castle walls. It seems that his house is near the castle. The closer you get to the castle where the nobility live, the higher the rent becomes, so it looks like Otto’s house is in what you might call an exclusive residential district.\n\n\n “Mister Otto, you live near the castle walls, even though you’re a soldier?”\n\n\n “I live in an apartment above Corinna’s parents’ home. Her older brother couldn’t bear to let go of his adorable little sister, so he told her to live there.”\n\n\n “Huh, I see…”\n\n\n Now that he mentions it, I think I remember hearing that it’s almost like he married into her family. Certainly, without the financial support of his wife’s family, he wouldn’t be able to afford living in such a place on a low-ranking soldier’s wages. He told me that he’d used up all his life’s savings to purchase his citizenship, so perhaps was everyone connected to his wife extremely concerned about how penniless they were immediately after getting married?\n\n\n Gradually, the kinds of people I see walking around start to change from what I’m used to. Their clothing is less and less patched together, and incorporates more and more fluttering, decorative fabrics in their design. The shops on the first floors of the buildings we walk past are different, as well. The shops themselves are bigger, with more employees and more customers going in and out. Along the roads, the number of coaches and wagons has been increasing, while I’ve been seeing fewer and fewer donkey-drawn carts.\n\n\n It’s an almost physical shock to see that such a clear class divide exists in a single city, and just within walking distance for me, too. I’d read about things like this, so I kind of had an idea of what it was like already, but there’s a night and day difference between imagining it and seeing it right in front of me. Eyes gleaming, I take in as much of the surroundings as I can.\n\n\n “It’s on the third floor here,” says Otto.\n\n\n “The third?!”\n\n\n Otto’s residence is on the third floor of a seven-story building. When the first floor of a building is a store, the second floor is generally the residence of the store’s owner. The third through sixth floor are rented out, and it’s very common to see the seventh story used for housing for the live-in apprentices and other employees of the store. The closer a floor is to the road, and the closer it is to a well, the more expensive it is. If I had to say it, my home is on the fifth story of a building out by the gates. (Please understand my financial situation.) For Corinna to have a place reserved for her right above her parents’ residence, she really must be this store’s beloved princess.\n\n\n …I wonder how he was even allowed to marry her. This is surprising! A trader and a rich young woman surely have very different social stature, I think, so how did something like this happen in this world?\n\n\n “I’m home, Corinna! I’ve brought Maine with me.”\n\n\n “Welcome, Maine. I’ve been waiting to meet you. My name is Corinna. I’m Otto’s wife.”\n\n\n “It’s nice to meet you, Miss Corinna. My name is Maine. I’m grateful to everything your husband has done for me.”\n\n\n This is my first time seeing Corinna, and I’m startled by how pretty and lovely of a woman she is. Her hair is a pale cream, as if the light of the moon had gathered in it. She has is gently gathered behind her, accentuating her slender neck. Her eyes are a silvery gray as well. Her whole color scheme is very light, making her seem almost ephemeral.\n\n\n In contrast, her boobs are huge. Everything she’s got that sticks out sticks way out, and her waist is very narrow.\n\n\n Otto, you’re so shallow!\n\n\n As I’m lead into the parlor, I let out an appreciative breath as I see the patchwork tapestries, Corinna’s handiwork, that decorate the walls. This is my first time since coming to this world that I’ve seen a house with anything ornamental in it. This is probably the room she uses to meet with potential clients, so it’s filled with both a large quantity of clothes as well as these decorations made from the fabric remnants. The colors throughout the room are put together with a good eye, giving the room a relaxing atmosphere.\n\n\n However, even in the house of a wealthy merchant, there are still more subtle concessions to frugality than I would have otherwise thought. The round table and chairs in the center of the room are neither finely engraved nor gleamingly polished, but are a simple, unornamented wooden design, with the wood left as is.\n\n\n If I remember correctly, the furniture of Northern Europe tended to be simple. Also, because people are often shut inside for long periods of time during the winter, perhaps the furniture is designed such that it’s possible to use it for long periods of time without getting tired of it.\n\n\n “Thank you for coming all this way,” says Corinna. “I’ve been very much looking forward to this ever since I heard you were coming to work on my hair.”\n\n\n As Corinna pours us some herb tea, the gentle voice she directs at me oozes the feeling of a well-raised daughter of a rich family. Her calm demeanor is one that could stir up a desire to protect her from harm.\n\n\n “I’m very flattered. I’ve heard so many things about you from Mister Otto as well, so I’ve also been looking forward to meeting you. He’d told me how beautiful and adorable you are, but the way you’ve decorated this room and the quality of the clothes you have laid out is beyond what I had heard.”\n\n\n “…You really are a very well-disciplined young lady. And, your hair is just as pretty as I had heard. I wonder, will my hair become like this as well?”\n\n\n Enraptured, Corinna gently strokes my hair. Last night, in order to make sure the value of this shampoo as a commodity was plainly visible, both my mother and Tory worked hard to make my hair practically shine. Today, my hair is even more glossy than it usually is.\n\n\n “Shall we begin immediately?” I ask.\n\n\n As I pull the small jar from my tote bag, Corinna’s face lights up with excitement. She’s absolutely adorable when she’s expressing herself so openly. I can definitely see why Otto dotes on her so much.\n\n\n “I would like to wash your hair, so I’ll need to make the necessary preparations for bathing. If it isn’t too much to ask, may I bother you for a bucket full of water and a cloth for washing?”\n\n\n “Bathing, you say?”\n\n\n Otto, not Corinna, shouts out in astonishment, his eyes going wide.\n\n\n “…I’m only going to be washing her hair, Mister Otto. Umm, Miss Corinna, while Mister Otto is getting things ready, would you please change into clothing that is okay to get wet?”\n\n\n “Yes,” she replies.\n\n\n “…Oh, she’s going to be wearing clothes, huh.”\n\n\n Corinna isn’t just a child like Lutz, so it’s only obvious that I’m not going to tell a woman such as herself to strip down. …Wait a minute, why are you talking like you’re hugely disappointed?\n\n\n Otto stands up to get everything ready for bathing, saying that physical labor is the man’s job. He spreads out a cloth in the bedroom and brings in some water, then sets a small washcloth next to my jar of shampoo.\n\n\n “…This is it, huh. What do you do with this?”\n\n\n Otto, with keenly interested eyes, picks up the jar, shakes it a bit, peeks inside, and takes a sniff. I’m suddenly keenly aware that if he were to stick around while I’m working on Corinna’s hair, he’ll try to help out with everything, keep opening his mouth, and otherwise constantly butt in on the two of us, making the whole process extremely bothersome.\n\n\n “This isn’t for men to see,” I say. “If you’re done with setting up, Mister Otto, please wait in another room.”\n\n\n “What? I’m her husband!”\n\n\n “If you’re the husband, then it’s even better for you to wait outside. When we’re finished, you can look at how beautiful your wife has become and shower her with compliments. Please don’t do something as un-gentlemanly as watching a woman pretty herself up.”\n\n\n “That’s right,” says Corinna. “Otto, please do wait in another room.”\n\n\n The two of us join forces and drive Otto, who still clearly wants to stay, out of the bedroom. I can hear his footsteps through the door as he wanders aimlessly around outside, but I ignore him, pouring some of the contents of the little jar into the washing bucket.\n\n\n “This is called a 'simple all-in-one shampoo’. To use it, you first fill up a bucket with about this much water, then pour about this much 'shampoo’ into it.”\n\n\n “Ahh…”\n\n\n “Next, we’ll drench your hair in the bucket, and wash it. Could I ask you to untie your hair, please?”\n\n\n Corinna loosens her hair, and I timidly lower it into the bucket. Somehow, it’s not as dirty as I thought it would be; perhaps it hasn’t been that long since she last bathed. In order to make sure her scalp is thoroughly cleaned, I pour water over her head over and over as I wash.\n\n\n “Please make sure you make extra effort to clean this part,” I explain as I work.\n\n\n “…Letting someone else wash my hair feels really nice. I never knew that before.”\n\n\n “I think that Otto would be happy to do it for you if you asked, you know?”\n\n\n Or, rather, I’m pretty sure he’d try to jump in even if she didn’t ask.\n\n\n “Oh? But didn’t you say that it was ungentlemanly for him to watch?”\n\n\n “…I just thought that it would be a problem for him to be bothering the two of us, that’s all.”\n\n\n “My! Heh heh, I wonder what in the world Otto has been saying around you for such a young girl as yourself to say things like that?”\n\n\n It’s harder for me to wash Corinna’s hair than it is for me to wash Tory’s, since Corinna is so much bigger. I know without a doubt, however, that Otto is going to base the number of nails he gives me on how satisfied she is with my handiwork. I work diligently, to the very best of my ability.\n\n\n “…Maine, do you mind if I ask you something?”\n\n\n “What is it?”\n\n\n I hear a hint of sharpness in her voice, and I’m suddenly put on edge.\n\n\n “What’s Otto like, at the gate?”\n\n\n “…Huh?”\n\n\n I was totally preparing myself to deflect a question about how to make my simple shampoo. Her question caught me completely off-guard, and what she was asking didn’t immediately register in my mind. I tilt my head to the side in confusion.\n\n\n Corinna frowns. “He gave up on his career as a trader all because of me,” she murmurs. “Sometimes I worry…”\n\n\n “There’s no need to worry,” I say. “Even working at the gates he’s still very much a trader.”\n\n\n He handles all of the accounting work by himself, even though it’s so busy. He haggles with traders over the prices of goods and furnishings. He uses his position at the gate to its fullest to gather useful information. Truly, his guiding principles are that of a trader.\n\n\n “Really? …He’s a trader, at the gate?”\n\n\n “Yes, he is. For example, when merchants come to deliver things to the gates, the wicked smile on his face while he drives down the price of the order is very trader-like.”\n\n\n “Heh heh, so you can see the trader in him. Yes… yes, of course. It’s a big weight off my chest to hear that.”\n\n\n I use the washcloth to dry off Corinna’s cream-colored hair. As I start to comb it out, it starts gleaming like a pearl.\n\n\n Just like when I was washing Lutz’s golden-blonde hair, I’m envious of how pretty Corinna’s hair looks. It would be great if my hair looked like that, wouldn’t it…\n\n\n “If you can, please use a wooden comb when you comb out your hair. As you continue to use it, the wood of the comb will absorb moisture from your hair, and will make it shine even brighter.”\n\n\n “Alright. …It’s really become quite beautiful, hasn’t it,” she murmurs appreciatively as she runs her fingers through her hair.\n\n\n “The color of your hair was already very nice, so all you need to do is maintain it to bring out its natural beauty. I recommend that you wash it like this every five to seven days.”\n\n\n I gesture at the pot, which contains the rest of the shampoo, as I give my recommendation. Corinna frowns slightly, tilting her head to the side.\n\n\n “Are you really alright with giving me this? I feel rather bad, not giving you anything in return…”\n\n\n “That’s alright. Mister Otto is already paying me for it, in nails.”\n\n\n “…Nails? Huh? Isn’t he getting the better end of the bargain? Are you alright with that?”\n\n\n Even though he might be profiting more right now, I haven’t given up the recipe for how to make my shampoo, I’m getting my hands on the nails that I wanted to get, and since I know that Corinna is going to want more shampoo in the future, I’ll be able to get more things I want in the future, too. There’s really no problem here.\n\n\n “Um, Maine. My clothes have gotten a bit wet, so I’d like to change. Would you mind waiting with Otto in the other room?”\n\n\n “Yes, ma'am.”\n\n\n I leave the bedroom so that Corinna can change her clothes in peace. As I open the door to leave, though, I see Otto, loitering by the bedroom door like a hungry bear waiting for his food to appear.\n\n\n “Corinna?!” he exclaims.\n\n\n “My clothes got a bit wet,” she says, poking her head around the door just a little bit, “so I’m going to change into something else. Otto, take care of Maine for me, would you?”\n\n\n Her hair still hasn’t completely dried, so it slips along her damp clothes as she peeks around the corner. Her shy demeanor radiates a certain kind of appeal.\n\n\n “I’m sorry to let you see me like this,” she says. “I’ll get changed right away.”\n\n\n Corinna hurriedly ushers me out of the room, then quickly closes the door. Otto had caught only a glimpse of her just now, but he’s staring at the door with a completely blank expression. When I see Otto’s longing reaction after only seeing a little bit of her, I strike a triumphant victory pose in my heart. Without a doubt, he’s falling in love with her all over again.\n\n\n “Eh heh heh, hasn’t Corinna become even more beautiful than before? Her creamy hair is shining like a jewel…”\n\n\n “Ngh! Corinna!”\n\n\n “She’s still changing!!”\n\n\n Otto unthinkingly starts charging towards the bedroom door, and I hurriedly try to block him. Of course, with my strength, I can’t do anything to stop him. The only one who can stop his rampage now is Corinna.\n\n\n “Otto,” she says from the other side of the door, “do you really want Maine to see me while I’m in the middle of changing?”\n\n\n As soon as he hears her gentle voice, he suddenly stops moving, like his batteries got yanked out. After a brief moment of silence, he turns to me. He gives me a beautiful, terrible smile as he firmly squeezes my shoulder.\n\n\n “…Maine, didn’t you have something important you needed to go do?”\n\n\n I get it. I want to make out with my wife, so get the hell out of here, he’s saying.\n\n\n I glance over at the bag sitting on the kitchen table. “I might remember something, depending on the number of nails I get,” I say, smiling sweetly.\n\n\n He looks at the bag of nails, then back at me. In his eyes, I can see a battle raging between his cool, calculating trader’s senses and his burning love for his wife.\n\n\n “…”\n\n\n “If you give me all of them, I might even give my father a good excuse for why I’m going home alone.”\n\n\n Otto, who’d promised he would properly look after me, presses the entire bag into my arms, and I quietly head out the door.\n\n\n …Go get 'em, tiger! Well, I acquired even more nails than I was hoping for, so, whatever. Please, do whatever it is you’re going to do!\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Gripping the bag full of nails tightly in both arms, I struggle my way down the street, all alone. Nails are heavy. A single one is pretty light, but when you pile them up like this, they’re heavy as hell. Even after just walking a little bit, my arms are already trembling.\n\n\n It’s no use. I need a break.\n\n\n At this rate, I’m not going to be able to stumble all the way home. I manage to make it to the fountain in the central plaza, then sit down to take a break.\n\n\n My arms hurt.\n\n\n As I shake out my trembling hands, then rub them together, Lutz comes into view, on his way home from somewhere. He walks past me, briskly.\n\n\n “Oh? Lutz, what’re you doing here?”\n\n\n “Maine?! What are you doing here? Uh… all by yourself?!”\n\n\n Fundamentally, my usual area of action is confined to my home, the gates, and the forest. Since I only ever take the shortest possible distance anywhere, I’m never out here in the central plaza. On top of that, since I have a habit of unexpectedly collapsing at any time, anywhere, it’s unheard of for me to be anywhere by myself. Lutz’s eyes go wide.\n\n\n “Hm? I’m on my way back from Mister Otto’s place. I was able to get all these nails from him. They’re really heavy, and it’s really far, so I’m taking a break.”\n\n\n “Argh,” he grumbles, “I’ll carry those for you. Man, why didn’t he make sure bring you back safely?”\n\n\n As he mumbles under his breath, he picks up the bag full of nails. I may have found that bag so heavy that it physically hurt me to carry it, but Lutz lifts is up like it isn’t even that big of a deal.\n\n\n “Thanks a lot, Lutz.”\n\n\n As the two of us walk back home, we tell each other about everything that happened today. While I was exchanging my shampoo for these nails, it looks like Lutz was asking around, checking with people who know a lot about the forest or know a lot about handling lumber to see if there might be any kinds of wood that would be easy to make paper with, or any plants that might be a reasonable substitute for sunset hibiscus.\n\n\n When making washi, you traditionally use sunset hibiscus as a binding agent, but here, if you’re looking for a sticky liquid, it seems that your best bet is either edil fruit or the bodily fluids of a slarmo bug.\n\n\n Ur… urgh. I’d much, much prefer to use edil fruits than squeezing out an insect’s fluids. Bugs, though, might be more resilient to the changing of the seasons…\n\n\n I shake my head to clear out the unwanted thoughts of juicing bugs, then change the topic of conversation.\n\n\n “Now that we’ve got nails, we can start working on the steamer.”\n\n\n “Hm? How big are we going to be making it? Didn’t you say you wanted it to match the pot we’ll be using? Did you get your mom to say we can use yours?”\n\n\n Our steaming basket doesn’t need to be very large at the moment, since we’re just starting out, but if we can I’d really like to match it up with the pot we’d be using. However, both of our families use their pots only for cooking. Even if we ask to borrow one, it’s unlikely they’ll lend it to us.\n\n\n “…No, I didn’t. Actually, one time she got really mad at me and told me not to use the pot for anything that wasn’t food.”\n\n\n If my mother won’t even let me cook dried fish, I don’t think she’d lend me a pot so that I can steam or boil any wood to make paper.\n\n\n “That’s no good,” he says.\n\n\n “It really isn’t. …So what do we do?”\n\n\n “Well, it’s not like I can make one myself…”\n\n\n Pots are expensive. Extremely expensive. They’re always in use, even when they’re in need of repair. This isn’t the kind of thing that we can easily get our hands on just because we want one. Manufacturing one out of metal would also be very difficult.\n\n\n “That’s right, isn’t it… maybe we should make the paper frame first. We already know how big it’ll be, so we can start on that now.”\n\n\n “…I guess we have to build what we know we can build, yeah.”\n\n\n We got even more nails than I’d hoped for, and we’ve tentatively identified some materials we can use as a substitute for sunset hibiscus sap… so that’s a step forward, at least… right?"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n While doing our gathering in the forest, Lutz and I start work on building the paper frame. The basic part of it is just a wooden frame, which we can build relatively easily out of wood and nails. The hardest part will be cutting lumber to size and making sure it’s straight; apart from that, the rest of the construction isn’t particularly difficult. In particular, since we’re not making a particularly large sheet of washi, just something about the size of a postcard, we don’t need to have any extra beams to support the paper mat.\n\n\n I’ll try constructing this following the pattern of the little frame I used when I made paper in home economics class.\n\n\n “Umm, if you could make it kinda like this…”\n\n\n On my slate, I show Lutz a sketch of the general shape of the frame, then write out the list of necessary components. As he looks it over, we head off to start cutting timber.\n\n\n “We have to make sure they’re perfectly straight, or it’s not going to work. It’s okay if we have to shave things down to make them fit together at the end, though.”\n\n\n “That’s harder than I thought. Straight, huh…”\n\n\n He cuts the wood into pieces for two rectangular frames, so that the inner dimensions are about the same size as a postcard. Once we finish building the structure for the upper and the lower frames, we attach boards to prevent the upper frame from sliding around as we spread out the pulp and a handle so that we can easily hold the upper frame by hand.\n\n\n “That’s it! Lutz, this is looking great!”\n\n\n “Is this what you wanted?”\n\n\n “Yeah! We’re going to put the paper mat between these frames like this, then grab the handle and rock it back and forth to spread out the fibers evenly. This is about the right shape for that.”\n\n\n “Shape?”\n\n\n Seeing Lutz’s dubious expression, I set the two frames on top of each other, then rattle them a bit to point out the uneven gaps between the two of them.\n\n\n “We need to make sure that there’s as few gaps between the two frames as we can get. Once we shave and polish these down so that they’re precisely flat, it’ll be perfect.”\n\n\n “Precisely?! I can’t ask my dad or brothers for help, and I don’t have the tools for that, you know…”\n\n\n “…Can you borrow the tools?”\n\n\n “I dunno…”\n\n\n Although Lutz may have given up on becoming a trader, he is still refusing his parents’ wishes for him to find a job relating to the woodworking or construction industries and has instead decided all by himself that he’s going to become a merchant’s apprentice. He must be getting an incredible amount of pressure from his parents. He’s not really in a circumstance where he can just walk in and ask to borrow some tools or get some help building something.\n\n\n Lutz’s father thinks that merchants are cold-blooded people who think about nothing but money, and is absolutely opposed to his son becoming someone like that. His mother, Carla, is very glad that he’s given up on being a trader and is instead looking for a job in the city, but she still wishes Lutz would give up on being a merchant, too.\n\n\n No matter what kind of opposition he might face, Lutz isn’t going to give up his dreams and will just keep forging ahead, despite his family’s disapproval. As for me, there’s not much I can actually do. My interactions with his family are usually restricted to indirectly talking about his tenacity and grabbing hold of their appetites with my recipes.\n\n\n Since we were able to get the frames in more-or-less the right shape, in the worst-case scenario we can whittle them down if it turns out we can’t actually use them. The biggest problem now is probably the mat we’ll be spreading the paper on. It’s a series of thin, rolled cylinders, almost like calligraphy pens, and we’re going to need to make it entirely from scratch. We need both bamboo rods of equal diameter and thread. Strong thread, at that, stronger than the kind of thread that Lutz and I ordinarily have access to. Getting bamboo rods down to the right size is going to be difficult as well. Even though we’re only making something postcard-sized, it’s easy to see that this is going to be an extremely difficult process.\n\n\n “Since we were able to make the frame today, tomorrow let’s start whittling down bamboo in order to make our rods. Although, can we actually make them round so easily, I wonder? Since we need them to be about the same size and thickness, I wonder if we should make them rectangular, instead? What do you think?”\n\n\n “I can’t really say I know anything about either making or using them…”\n\n\n Since I’m still not very good with my knife, I’m not particularly useful, but that doesn’t change the fact that we’re going to need a lot of these, and that they need to be very thin. However, I’m still very happy, since we managed to meet our goal for the day and make our frame.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n As we pass through the gates on our way home, Otto calls out to us. “Maine, ah, Lutz, too! Could you come here for a minute?”\n\n\n It wouldn’t be unusual if he were just calling me over, since it could be something relating to my job as his assistant, but this is the first time he’s called Lutz over as well.\n\n\n “Me too?” Lutz asks as we walk over.\n\n\n “That’s right. I have a written invitation for the two of you.”\n\n\n He delivers us another invitation, just like the one Corinna sent to me the other day. My studying has born fruit, and I quickly skim it, picking out who the sender and addressee are. It’s an invitation from Benno, addressed to me and Lutz.\n\n\n “From Mister Benno, to me and Lutz?”\n\n\n “Huh, I wonder why?” says Lutz.\n\n\n I thought we wouldn’t see him again until we’d successfully made paper. I have no idea what this invitation could be about, since the two of us aren’t his apprentices yet.\n\n\n “This says tomorrow,” I say, “so this must be really urgent. What could it be? …Maybe, is he rejecting us without even seeing our product?”\n\n\n Perhaps someone with a stronger connection to him asked for a favor and he decided to take someone else as an apprentice, or perhaps he was able to piece something together from bits of information I’ve let slip and intends to make it himself so he doesn’t need us anymore… all of the worst-case scenarios start tumbling around in my head.\n\n\n “What?!” exclaims Lutz. “Are you serious?!”\n\n\n “No, no!” says Otto, quickly. “It’s not that!”\n\n\n I frown up at him. “Mister Otto, do you know what this is about?”\n\n\n “…Aaah~, well, so after Benno saw Corinna’s hair, he started hammering me for information, so I just kind of let my part in all of it slip out, so it’s about all that.”\n\n\n “So this invitation is your fault, then! Why would you just let that slip out?!”\n\n\n “Isn’t it only natural for a husband to brag about how his wife has become so beautiful?”\n\n\n Did he specifically go to Benno’s place to brag about Corinna to get back at me for taking every last nail from him?\n\n\n Although I have plenty of complaints for Otto, that doesn’t change the fact that this invitation has been delivered into our hands, and since we’re hoping that he’ll accept us as his apprentices, this isn’t something that we’re going to be able to decline.\n\n\n “This says we’re supposedly going to meet him for lunch,” I say. “I wonder if we’ll be able to eat something amazing?”\n\n\n “Ohh! I’m going! I’m absolutely going!!”\n\n\n Lutz is suddenly one hundred percent all-in on going to this thing. A poor child who is always hungry would be dazzled in a single instant by the thought of a sumptuous meal. I’m also actually fairly interested in what rich people eat.\n\n\n The written invitation also lists the time and place at which we should meet. Benno would like us to meet him at his shop, when the fourth bell chimes.\n\n\n “…Where is Benno’s shop?” I ask Otto. “We don’t know where that is, you know?”\n\n\n “It’s on the first floor of my building.”\n\n\n Otto’s home is above Corinna’s family’s home, and was prepared for Corinna by her much older brother who was worried about his adorable little sister. So, Corinna must be Benno’s younger sister, so Otto and Benno must be…\n\n\n “…Is he your brother-in-law?”\n\n\n “That’s right.”\n\n\n I guess it isn’t strange at all for the things I talk about with Otto to go straight through to Benno, then. I don’t really feel like saying anything more.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, Lutz and I put on the nicest clothes that we can, then start heading towards Benno’s shop. After we pass through the central plaza, the buildings around us start steadily becoming nicer. Lutz has never gone past the plaza to the castle walls before, so he is constantly looking around, taking in everything he can see.\n\n\n “Wow, this is amazing…”\n\n\n “Yeah, it’s totally different, even though it’s still the same town. I was super surprised as well, back when I went to Otto’s house.”\n\n\n “If the town can change this much, I wonder if lunch is going to be this much better than what I get at home! I’m really looking forward to this.”\n\n\n Lutz’s smile is both broad and innocent. I sigh lightly, and give him some advice.\n\n\n “You should be careful about how you eat.”\n\n\n “Hm?”\n\n\n “I think he’s absolutely going to be checking our table manners, like how we eat.”\n\n\n “What?! I don’t know anything about that, though!”\n\n\n I don’t know anything about it either. More accurately, I don’t know whether or not I’ll be able to pass my own table manners off as what they have here. We have only a single countermeasure.\n\n\n “Be careful about your posture. Then, instead of just immediately shoving food into our faces, let’s watch how Mister Benno does it first. I don’t think it’ll be a big mistake to copy what he does.”\n\n\n “…Aw maaan, now I’m nervous!”\n\n\n Uneasy with uncertainties over what might lie in store for us, the two of us continue forward, holding hands for some reason. We arrive in front of Benno’s shop well before the fourth bell has rung. Since our meeting is at the fourth bell, we need to kill some time waiting by the shop.\n\n\n “What do we do now?”\n\n\n “Hm? Well, since we’re already in the area, I want to take a look at the shop. I don’t know anything at all about how it’s managed, how many people work there, what apprentices do there, or anything at all, really.”\n\n\n “…You’re right.”\n\n\n I’m used to using the internet or magazines when it comes to researching a potential place of employment. Here, though, I have neither of those things. Instead, you have to either pick things up by word of mouth or go to see things with your own eyes. If you don’t do either of those things, you can’t get any useful information.\n\n\n Normally, you’d learn about how a particular industry worked by hearing about your parents’ jobs, and then you’d learn about the place you’d be working by listening to what the person to whom you were referred had to say. However, since Otto kept the fact that he and Benno were brothers-in-law, I don’t know if he’ll let any useful information flow. When I brought Lutz to hear Otto talk about being a trader, even Benno introduced himself as “an acquaintance from when Otto was a trader”. He didn’t say a single thing about the actual job, perhaps because he had every intention of rejecting us outright. So, since I’ve got an opportunity right now to observe how this shop works right now, I want to make the most of it.\n\n\n “They don’t have very many things lined up for sale,” I say.\n\n\n “There’s also way fewer people going in and out than at the town market. I wonder if this shop really is profitable?”\n\n\n “I think it has to be. It’s very tidy, and the employees’ appearance and manner are much nicer than shops closer to the wall, I think. Since they’re so well trained and well groomed, maybe they do business with rich people or the nobility.”\n\n\n Even the man standing in front of the store like a guard is dressed in better clothing than we are. That alone is proof that this shop is frequented by those who care a lot about appearance. It seems like there are many barriers that Lutz and I will have to overcome if we want to work here, since we come from such different worlds.\n\n\n Da-dong, da-donnng…\n\n\n The fourth bell rings through the town, telling everyone that it is now noon. At the same time, the shop’s employees start closing everything down.\n\n\n “Huh? Huh?! They’re closing down?!”\n\n\n I grab Lutz by the hand, then frantically run towards Benno’s shop, pulling him along behind me. If everything is closed down and everyone goes home, I’ll have no idea what to actually do. I call out to the guard as he turns to head into the shop, holding up my invitation.\n\n\n “Excuse meee! The two of us were invited here by Mister Benno; would you be able to tell us what we should do next, please?”\n\n\n “Ah, there’s no need to panic. I hear you, but would you mind waiting a bit until we’ve finished closing up?”\n\n\n After they finish closing the shop for lunch, all of the employees head off to get some food, leaving just the one guard behind. It seems like I didn’t need to call out while they were in the middle of closing the shop, I could have just greeted the guard afterward. Immediately after the shop is closed and the employees have all scattered, the guard leads us inside.\n\n\n “Sir, you have guests,” he says.\n\n\n “Ah, show them in,” comes a voice from another room.\n\n\n The guard opens a door, lets us in, then closes it behind us with a respectful bow. At a single glance, it’s obvious that this room is used for business discussions. The shelves around the room are lined with a variety of things that I’m not used to seeing. Behind the wooden desk at which Benno is seated are more shelves, where piles of wooden boards and scrolls have accumulated.\n\n\n Are those bookshelves?!\n\n\n There aren’t any books, so it might be more accurate to call them document shelves, but those are shelves that are packed with writing. I start to unsteadily wander over towards them, but when Benno stands up I manage to stop myself, planting my feet firmly to the ground.\n\n\n “Sorry for calling you out here on such short notice,” he says. “I thought I absolutely needed to have a talk with you.”\n\n\n “About what, sir?”\n\n\n “How about we have lunch first? We can talk afterwards.”\n\n\n I take the seat Benno offers me, though my line of sight to the bookshelf-like shelves is cut off. Lutz sits next to me, looking just a little bit nervous.\n\n\n “I’ll have it brought right in.”\n\n\n Benno picks up a small bell from the desk and rings it three times. A door at the back of the room opens, and a young woman comes out, bearing food on a tray. It seems like there must be a stairway to connect this floor to the second floor above.\n\n\n “Maine, Lutz, welcome,” she says. “I hope you’ll enjoy your meal.”\n\n\n I thought she might have been Benno’s wife, but since he didn’t introduce her at all, it could be that she’s one of his employees or perhaps a servant.\n\n\n “Thank you very much,” is all I say as I study the tableware set out in front of me. We each have an empty plate, a fork, and a spoon. There isn’t a great difference between the amount of cutlery we’re using here and that I use at home; the only difference is that Benno is the only one with a knife in front of him. It seems like it’s the responsibility of Benno, the master of the house, to serve our plates. He serves salad and meat onto our plates, and gives us bowls of soup.\n\n\n “Please, enjoy.”\n\n\n Lutz had been trying his best in his own special way, but as soon as we start eating it seems like all of my advice immediately spills out of his head, and he starts shoving food into his face with great gusto.\n\n\n Perhaps Lutz should also learn some table manners before we start working.\n\n\n I pick up my fork, then start to eat. I keep an eye on Benno as I do, but it seems that his table manners aren’t much different from mine. Although I think this to be the case, for some reason Benno keeps studying me closely. I wonder if I’m making some sort of mistake? I eat timidly, nervous that I’m making some small errors that I just can’t notice. I don’t think I’m doing anything exceptionally rude, though, so I have no idea what he could be quite so focused on.\n\n\n For today, at least, the manners I know tell me that leaving just a little bit of food left on the plate would show that I’m full to my satisfaction. I had been thinking that leaving any leftovers would be rude, so I kept eating, but at some point my mouth just clamped shut when I tried to eat any more.\n\n\n I’d had some degree of expectation for a rich man’s lunch, but the only real difference is in the quantity, not the flavor. It seems like their cooking methods are still the same. Yet another letdown. Lutz, however, thinks quantity is king, and looks absolutely satisfied.\n\n\n “Now that our bellies are full, shall we talk?”\n\n\n “Yes,” I reply.\n\n\n Benno sips on some dark, coffee-like beverage with an unusual scent, and we’re given herbal tea as we start our conversation.\n\n\n “First, I’d like to ask you something.”\n\n\n “What is it?”\n\n\n “Why did you rely on Otto for that?”\n\n\n Benno’s expression and tone show both irritation and a little bit of anger. Lutz draws back, and I tilt my head to the side a little.\n\n\n “I’m sorry, but I don’t quite understand what you’re asking. I’ve always relied on Otto for many things, so to what and to when are you referring?”\n\n\n “Otto told me that he’d lent you nails, and that you’d exchanged that liquid you put in your hair for it, didn’t you?”\n\n\n “Yes. …Was there a problem with that? I don’t think there was anyone else I know that I could have asked to get me nails.”\n\n\n I have no idea why Benno would be upset that Otto gave me nails. Perhaps he’s upset that I gave him some shampoo? I sit there, head tilted to the side and not understanding at all. Benno lets out an enormous sigh.\n\n\n “This is common sense to a merchant, but it would have been best for you to consult with me first.”\n\n\n “With you, sir?”\n\n\n “That’s right,” he says, with a solemn nod.\n\n\n It seems like it this would indeed be common sense for a merchant of this world, but I still don’t understand it.\n\n\n “But, the two of us aren’t your apprentices yet, right? I thought that making paper was going to be our test, so asking you for help seemed to me like it would be illogical.”\n\n\n “Not true. If you can make that paper, then you’ll work here as an apprentice, and it’ll be a good sold through this shop. The first person you should be consulting is thus me, and not Otto.”\n\n\n Although we’re still not officially apprentices, it seems that we should perhaps still be thinking of him as our superior, since we have a conditional employment agreement. I had thought that making paper was our test, but I should consider it to be an extension of our jobs. If I think of it like that, then this matter is simple: Benno’s sub-apprentices asked someone who was not him for assistance in a matter related to their work, which reflects poorly on him as a supervisor.\n\n\n “I’m sorry,” I say, “I understand what you mean. We damaged your reputation, or, rather, hurt your honor as our supervisor. We’ll be more careful of this in the future.”\n\n\n Seeing that I’ve understood and reflected on my actions, Benno nods several times, then straightens up in his chair.\n\n\n “Now then, let’s negotiate. I’m prepared to offer you all of the materials you think necessary to make paper in exchange for the manufacturing method for the liquid you use in your hair.”\n\n\n “Huh? Making paper is our test to become your apprentices, isn’t it? Are you okay with supplying us like this?”\n\n\n I thought that the test was to see if we could put everything together on our own. If Benno were to provide us with the materials we need, then our task suddenly becomes much easier.\n\n\n “There’s no way that you could start a new industry like that when you have no tools, no manpower, and no prior investment. Still, you can’t be asking someone who, at least on the surface, has nothing to do with the project for assistance. If you had some form of collateral, you could get a loan, but you don’t have anything to offer, do you?”\n\n\n It goes without saying, but Lutz and I, the children of poor people, have absolutely nothing we could use as collateral on a loan.\n\n\n “Information isn’t something you could return to us when we’re finished, so we can’t use it as collateral, right?”\n\n\n “That’s why, in this case we’re not discussing a loan, but a trade. I’m buying your recipe. In exchange, I’ll provide you with everything you need to make paper. …Surely you don’t think this is a bad deal?”\n\n\n “It certainly doesn’t seem to be a bad one.”\n\n\n If we commission the custom tools we need and purchase the materials through Benno’s suppliers, there’s a chance the paper manufacturing method might leak out, but for someone like me, who can’t even procure a single pot, getting this assistance would be like removing the noose from my neck.\n\n\n “Lutz, what do you think?”\n\n\n He’s been sitting next to me this entire time, wordlessly listening. Making paper is both of our jobs. It wouldn’t be right for me to make a decision like this without getting his input as well. However, he looks away a little bit, shaking his head.\n\n\n “…Thinking about these things is your job, right? Whatever you think is fine by me.”\n\n\n “Really?”\n\n\n If that’s what Lutz thinks, then I should try to get us the best terms for this arrangement that I can. If Benno will agree to provide us with both tools and, of course, raw materials, then we can focus entirely on making the paper itself.\n\n\n “I’d like to clarify something, sir. When you say you’ll provide us with what we need, do you mean just the tools, or does that include the raw materials as well?”\n\n\n “I don’t mind if we include the materials. You want to experiment with a variety of things, correct? I heard that Lutz was asking a lumber dealer about different kinds of wood.”\n\n\n That’s right, a merchant’s broad network of connections can be terrifying. If unfamiliar children are wandering around and gathering information, that news is of course going to immediately start to spread.\n\n\n “How long will this support continue?”\n\n\n “Until your baptismal ceremony. Before then, you can’t become apprentices, after all. To keep appearances, I’ll sell whatever you manage to bring me. From the gross, I’ll withhold the cost of the materials and the sale, plus a commission; the rest will be yours. After your baptisms, you’ll come to this shop to operate the paper trade, and ten percent of the net profits will be added to your wages as a bonus.”\n\n\n There’s no problem with what he’s proposing for before the ceremony. We come to him with any completed paper we make, and he sells it. Even if the commission he charges is relatively high, our profits will still be assured.\n\n\n However, I’m somewhat uneasy about what would happen after the ceremony. Having our share of the profits added to our wages sounds good, but, what happens if we’re dismissed? If he’s no longer paying us any wage, then it’s possible that he won’t pay us our share of the profits, either. It feels like there’s an enormous gap between the common knowledge we should have in this circumstance and the knowledge we actually have from our daily lives. If paper production goes according to plan, once its profitability is realized we don’t actually have any guarantees after that.\n\n\n “In addition to the bonus to our wages, please let me retain the exclusive rights to manufacture the paper, and let Lutz retain the exclusive rights to sell it.”\n\n\n “…What do you mean?”\n\n\n “Once we’re able to make paper, it’s possible that you’d fire us as soon as you got your hands on the actual goods, and that would be very bad for us. I would much rather have a long-term guarantee over the chance for immediate profits.”\n\n\n Benno’s eyes briefly glimmer as he strokes his chin.\n\n\n “Well, looking out for yourself wasn’t bad at all. Your childish reasoning is, however, full of holes.”\n\n\n “Urgh… I’ll have to study.”\n\n\n Since I still lack the necessary bits of local common sense, no matter how hard I wrack my brain, my reasoning will always still be childish.\n\n\n “So, then, if we leave the rights to the paper at that, are you going to stake any claim with regards to the rights to your hair-glossing liquid?”\n\n\n “No, sir, I won’t contest you for the rights to my ‘simple shampoo’. I’d be selling those to you.”\n\n\n I have no intention of demanding rights to something I am trying to sell. To me, the circulation of paper is the best possible outcome, and I’d like to be able to offer Lutz’s family some kind of guarantee of his long-term success as a merchant’s apprentice, since they’re still opposed to this path.\n\n\n “Well, that’s fine. The various rights relating to the manufacturing and sale of the paper will be yours. However, as long as the two of you are working here, you’ll do all of your sales through this shop. You’ll have no right to determine either the price of sale or your profits, and there will be no bonus to your wages. That should cover everything, right?”\n\n\n “That sounds alright to me. This is simply just insurance, after all.”\n\n\n Right now, guaranteeing a place where we can work and earn a steady wage is the most important thing. I’m fine with earning our profits slowly, over the long term. Beyond just the hairpin that first caught Benno’s eye, my recipes, and even my beauty products, I can think of quite a few things off the top of my head that I can turn into serious profits if I can first get the necessary raw materials, after all.\n\n\n “Alright then. That’s all for now, then. I’ll be heading out to the noblemen’s residences for the afternoon. I’ll be back in the evening, so until then, the two of you should stay here and fill out the orders for your supplies. Write out everything you’ll need in order to make your paper.”\n\n\n I’m happy with how quickly our work is progressing now, but I still haven’t learned how to write up supply orders while working at the gates.\n\n\n “…If I don’t know how to write a supply order?”\n\n\n “I’ll have someone teach you. If you’re able to finish by this evening, I’ll show you something nice, as a prize.”\n\n\n “Something nice?”\n\n\n “When you are absolutely serious about ensuring your own profits, or making deals with the nobility, there is a way of forming a contract that is almost never used outside of extremely profitable, high-stakes transactions. This isn’t something either of you would have seen if you’ve just been doing your business in the town markets. This isn’t just a verbal agreement, I’ll guarantee you your rights.”\n\n\n Certainly, I was hoping for a written contract, not just a verbal agreement, but I hadn’t thought Benno would be the one to bring it up.\n\n\n “…Why would you go that far for us, sir? Wouldn’t it leave you in a better position if this were to remain a verbal agreement only?”\n\n\n Benno shakes his head, smiling broadly.\n\n\n “What I want is to promptly and contractually protect my rights to this 'simple sham-poo’. If we simply had a verbal agreement, then it would be quite problematic for me if you were to assert your own claim on it once it started to become profitable. This contract will guarantee your own rights to the paper, in exchange for completely giving up your rights to the 'sham-poo’.”\n\n\n “Thank you very much.”\n\n\n I wonder if he wanted to say that we shouldn’t be fully trusting each other, since the two of us have only ever met twice. If we have a written contract, then both of us can rest easy.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n As the employees start returning from their lunch break one by one, Benno appoints one person to serve as our teacher for the afternoon. The prim aura of a butler practically rolls off of him, so heavily that I instinctively want to call him Sebastian.1\n\n\n “Mark, this is Maine and Lutz. Please teach them how to write up a materials order. I’ll leave them in your care until I’m back.”\n\n\n “Very well, Master Benno,” he replies.\n\n\n Benno gives further directions to the other employees as he gets ready to leave. As he heads out the door, he stops briefly and turns his head to call out to Mark.\n\n\n “Ah, I almost forgot. Mark, while I’m out, get everything set up for the contract magic.”\n\n\n Contract magic?\n\n\n I think I heard him correctly.\n\n\n Huh? Was this… a fantasy… setting?\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. “Sebastian” is the name of the title character from the anime Black Butler. He is a butler."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n At Mark’s request, one of the female employees clears off the table in front of us. As she does so, he brings over a platter, bearing various things. It might be more accurate to call the thing he’s holding a “tray”, but since he’s so incredibly butler-like, it’s difficult to refer to the round, flat, wooden disk as anything but a platter.\n\n\n Mark sets out the objects he brought on the table in front of us: a number of thin boards, a pot of ink, some kind of pen made from something like bamboo or reed, a slate, a slate pencil, and a cloth. He lines them up perfectly, without the slightest bend in the line, then looks up at us.\n\n\n “Now then, I shall teach you how to write a materials order.”\n\n\n “Thank you very much,” I reply.\n\n\n “Th… thank you,” mumbles Lutz.\n\n\n Mark glances back and forth between the two of us, comparing us.\n\n\n “Lutz, are you able to write?”\n\n\n “…I can just write my name.”\n\n\n It seems that Lutz has held on to the name-writing lesson I taught him back when we were making clay tablets. However, the writing we’ll need to do here isn’t just limited to one’s own name, so he turns away to hide an embarrassed expression. Mark nods once, with a thoughtful hum, then picks up the slate and places it neatly in front of Lutz.\n\n\n “You say that you are able to write your name? I had heard that you were not the children of merchants, so… you’ve surprised me. You’ll have no problems with the contract. However, if you were to work as an apprentice here, you would be expected to know how to write every letter. While Maine and I work on preparing the materials order, why don’t we have you practice writing some basic letters?”\n\n\n It seems that Mark had thought Lutz, having not come from a merchant family, wouldn’t be able to write his own name, and had planned on having him learn how so that he could sign the contract. Changing his plans, he writes five or so letters on top of the slate, and has Lutz start practicing those. I wonder if he’s in charge of teaching the apprentices how to write? He seems very used to this teaching method.\n\n\n “Maine, are you able to write?”\n\n\n “There are definitely words that I won’t know, but if you can teach me those, I’ll be able to write them.”\n\n\n “Very well.”\n\n\n Mark places two boards in front of me, one with nothing written on it at all, and one that already has some things on it. Some sort of copybook, perhaps. There are a few words I don’t understand, but I can read about seventy percents of it.\n\n\n “This reads ‘order for goods’,” he says, indicating the words at the very top. He also teaches me about the general format of the document. Once he shows me the words for “ordering proprietor”, “goods requested”, and “quantity requested”, the rest of it is not particularly difficult.\n\n\n “Now then, do you know what materials and tools you need to order?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir.”\n\n\n With a big nod, I start to write. The board clatters as I write on it, though, making it harder than I thought it was going to be. On top of that, this unfamiliar pen is very difficult to write with, making this rather unpleasant. Compared to a pen like this, the soot pencils I made were far easier to write with, although the letters did crumble and smudge into an illegible mess of black at the slightest touch.\n\n\n “Urgh,” I say, “this is so different from writing on a slate.”\n\n\n “You’re doing very well for your first time,” says Mark.\n\n\n Being praised like that lifts my spirits, and I press on. As my pen slides crisply across the board, Mark looks over my shoulder at what I’m ordering, frowning slightly.\n\n\n “…Maine, we can purchase a pot, but how big do you need it to be?”\n\n\n “Ummm… I think one the same size as the second-biggest one we have at my house would be okay, but…”\n\n\n Mark’s frown deepens. It’s clear to see that my explanation did nothing to clear things up for him.\n\n\n Right, I see. There’s no way he’d know what I meant when I’d talk about my family’s pots, right? However, I have no idea how to express the size of the pot I want. I don’t think they use centimeters here, so how should I explain it?\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz,” I say. “About how big is the pot you use to carry water?”\n\n\n “Hm? Oh, um… about this big,” he says, making a circle with his arms.\n\n\n After I pass the buck completely to a little kid… ahem, ahem, I mean, after I ask Lutz, the most knowledgable expert on the matter for his opinion, Mark immediately takes out something like a tape measure and quickly measures the circle Lutz has made.\n\n\n “And its depth?” he asks.\n\n\n “Lutz, how deep is it?”\n\n\n “About this deep,” says Lutz, spreading out his hands. Again, Mark takes a quick measurement.\n\n\n Since there’s never been any sort of measuring device around, until now I’ve been doing all of my measurement by eye. There’s never been any need for anything precise. However, although that might be fine when we’re making things on our own, when we’re placing orders for other people to fill, that kind of ambiguity is unacceptable. I hold my head in my hands, and let out a small groan.\n\n\n I raise my hand, looking at Mark. “…Mister Mark, before I write out this order, would you please teach me the units of measurement for length?”\n\n\n “Of course,” he replies.\n\n\n “Also, after we leave today, we won’t be able to place any more orders since we don’t have any way to make measurements ourselves. Could you lend us a measuring tape?”\n\n\n If we can’t measure the frame that we’ve already built, we can’t make the paper mat.\n\n\n “Let us order a tape measure for you as well. It seems like you’ll be needing one now.”\n\n\n When we’re making trial runs in order to determine things like the types of wood we’ll need and the mixing ratios we’ll be using, we’ll be making postcard-sized sheets. However, when we’ve managed to perfect it, we’ll be making much larger sheets. When we do, we will, of course, need larger tools. A measuring device is necessary.\n\n\n Mark lends me a measuring tape. As he explains how to use it, I start working on writing out the order.\n\n\n Steamer, pot, squared timber, ashes, tub, paper frame, drying bed, weights, flat board. Also, raw wood and sunset hibiscus sap.\n\n\n Since I want to start making paper as soon as I can, I want to list out absolutely everything right now, but until we actually get our pot, I don’t know how big the steamer will need to be. And, if we don’t know how big the steamer will be, we don’t know how large the wood we’ll need the wood to be, either.\n\n\n I describe the squared timber to Mark and explain how it’s used, and we decide how large and heavy it will need to be. For the ashes, we don’t know how much we’ll need until we actually try making paper, so for now we order a small bag of it. For the rest of what we need, I wrack my brain madly, trying to figure out how best to explain it.\n\n\n “Aaargh, this is hard. For the paper mat, I actually want to bring the frame we’ve already made directly to the craftsman and talk with him myself.”\n\n\n “I agree,” replies Mark. “I’m not entirely certain what would would serve well as this paper mat that you describe. Even after looking at this diagram you’ve drawn for me, I still don’t quite understand it.”\n\n\n Aside from the paper mat, which made even Mark give up, we somehow manage to get everything else written into out into an order.\n\n\n As I’ve been grappling with this supply order, Lutz has been valiantly practicing his letters. I’m actually shocked to see that, even though I’m fairly certain he’s not used to sitting down and working for long periods like this, he’s showing an amazing ability to concentrate. This is very different from the apprentice soldiers that came to study at the gates. It’s only natural, though: of course you’ll be able to concentrate harder on something you think is important to you.\n\n\n However, Lutz’s facial expression is completely blank. I wonder if he’s been pushing himself too hard?\n\n\n “Now then, since we still have some time remaining, how about you learn how to calculate? Here, we add our sums using calculators like this.”\n\n\n After taking a brief break, Mark starts instructing Lutz in how to use a calculator. Since I don’t how to use calculators in this world either, I sit next to him, watching and listening as well. As I mentally compare this simple device with an abacus, Mark briefly pauses his explanation and looks at me, head cocked slightly to one side in curiosity.\n\n\n “Maine, aren’t you already able to do calculations? I have heard as much from the master.”\n\n\n “Oh, I, don’t actually use a calculator.”\n\n\n “Then, how do you perform your calculations?”\n\n\n “I do them on my slate.”\n\n\n On my slate, I start working out by hand the calculations Mark gives me. He calls my ability to work out large out large sums unbelievable, so, somehow, I wind up teaching him a little bit about how to do complex calculations by hand.\n\n\n “If you have a calculator,” he says, “you wouldn’t need to know how to 'work things out by hand’, as you call it, correct?”\n\n\n “There are times when you don’t have a calculator, and it’s useful then. Also, though I can see how you use a calculator, I don’t actually know how it produces those numbers. It’s very interesting to me.”\n\n\n I marvel at Mark, who seems completely mystified by an arithmetic lesson usually reserved for elementary school students. The things I think of as completely obvious aren’t completely obvious at all. Once again, I’m struck by how awesome Japan’s public education system is.\n\n\n Maybe it would be a good idea to not spread around this kind of thing too much?\n\n\n In my view, sharing knowledge is a good thing, but I don’t know if that meshes well with how things are commonly done in this world. Perhaps I’ve gone a little bit overboard, this time.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “It’s almost time for the master to return. I’ll start making arrangements for the contract magic.”\n\n\n “What’s 'contract magic’?”\n\n\n I can’t stop my heart from pounding when I hear those words, the first fantasy-sounding thing I’ve heard since coming here. I had never even considered that a world as filthy and unpleasant as this one could possibly contain something as fantastical as magic.\n\n\n Could I maybe use magic too? Is that my reincarnation-story-protagonist cheat?! Exhilarated, I sit on the edge of my seat, waiting for Mark’s answer.\n\n\n He chuckles at me. “Magic, as you know, is something that only the nobility possess.”\n\n\n “…Only the nobility?”\n\n\n “Yes, that’s right. Since it’s so rare for people like us to see, it’s not something that we understand very well.”\n\n\n In an instant, my joy at having found myself in a fantasy world is smashed to bits.\n\n\n Only the nobility have magic? What the hell. They’re not just keeping books from me, but magic too? Those damn aristocrats.\n\n\n “Contract magic was originally created as a way to keep the more violent noblemen in check. To perform it, you need a special ink and paper. If you write and execute a contract with those, then you’ll be bound to the terms of the contract by magic. It’s a powerful way to ensure that neither party breaks the terms of their agreement.”\n\n\n “Huhhh, that really is convenient.”\n\n\n A contract, guaranteed by magic, that can’t just be torn up and ignored seems very useful indeed.\n\n\n “It’s convenient, but the paper and ink are magic tools, and are thus both very rare and very expensive, so it isn’t used except for the most profitable contracts.”\n\n\n I see. Somehow, it seems that Benno sees a tremendous amount of profit in my simple shampoo.\n\n\n Certainly, consumable products have that kind of power. If you run out of them, then you’ll need to get more. I can’t imagine a woman out there who would ever let their supply run out once they got used to having glossy, silky hair. This is doubly true for those women with money, like the noblewomen who put so much effort into their appearances.\n\n\n …Did I perhaps sell this for too cheaply?\n\n\n As soon as that thought flashes through my head, I remember that it’s not good to be too greedy. What Lutz and I need are security, stability, and a firm financial footing. I should focus on securing that.\n\n\n “Sorry to keep you waiting,” says Benno, walking quickly as he walks through the door of the shop. It seems like he was actually concerned about how long we were waiting.\n\n\n “Are you finished with the materials order?”\n\n\n “We’ve written up what we can for now.”\n\n\n I indicate the pile of boards that we’ve accumulated behind me. “That’s a lot,” he murmurs. There’s still stuff we need to measure, Benno, so there’ll be even more soon. We’re counting on you.\n\n\n “How is Lutz doing?” asks Benno.\n\n\n Mark proudly places his hand on his chest as he answers. “He was already able to write his name when we began, so ever since then he has been devoted to learning how to write beyond that. This young man has an excellent memory.”\n\n\n “Ah, I see.”\n\n\n Even though Mark is praising him, Lutz only manages a small nod of acknowledgement, as if there’s something big on his mind. He’s spent a full half of a day studying, so it’s likely that he’s quite tired by now. Doing something you’re not used to is very exhausting, after all.\n\n\n “Mark must have explained this by now, but for this contract magic we use a paper specifically used for contracts and a special kind of ink. This is something that only merchants who’ve been approved to work with the nobility can use.”\n\n\n Benno takes out a small ink bottle with a peculiar design. At a glance, it looks like it contains regular ink, but it seems like it must be something completely different. As I watch him intently, Benno neatly spreads the blank contract out on the table in front of him.\n\n\n “…Is it okay for you to be using that? It looks very rare and expensive.”\n\n\n “I wouldn’t be using it if I didn’t think this was a very important contract. Don’t worry about it.”\n\n\n …If you tell me not to worry about it, I’ll worry about it.\n\n\n Benno dips a pen into the inkwell, then smoothly begins to write out the terms of the contract. The ink is actually not black, but a rich blue. As Benno fills the page with neat, practiced handwriting, I follow along closely.\n\n\n Maine agrees to transfer all rights to her Simple Shampoo to Benno.\n\n\n In exchange, Benno agrees to assume all costs of the paper-making enterprise to be undertaken by Maine and Lutz, until the date of their baptismal ceremony.\n\n\n Maine will retain all rights relating to the manufacturing of the paper, and Lutz will retain all rights to the sale of the paper.\n\n\n However, they will retain neither the right set the sales price of the paper, nor the right determine their profits.\n\n\n Maine carefully reads the contents of the contract from end to end, verifying that nothing strange has been written. This, however, is only a pretense. In reality, I’m taking this time to deeply inhale the intoxicating scent of fresh ink on paper.\n\n\n Aaah, I want to make paper, then make books, so badly…\n\n\n “…Is there some sort of problem?” asks Benno, incredulously.\n\n\n With a sigh, I come back to my senses. I turn to face a suspicious Benno and an amazed Lutz. I think Lutz might have realized that I was captivated by the smell of the ink.\n\n\n “Wha?! Ev… everything looks fine! You’ve written things out just like we talked about them, so there’s no problems.”\n\n\n “…I’m fine, too,” says Lutz.\n\n\n Benno nods, then dips the pen into the inkwell once more.\n\n\n At the bottom of the contract, Benno signs his name. He spins the pen around and offers it to me. I exchange a brief glance with Lutz, then accept it.\n\n\n I run a finger across the parchment. It’s so much softer than the paper I’m used to. Satisfied, I adjust my grip on the pen. I carefully dip it into the inkwell, letting the nib absorb just enough ink so that a tiny bead forms on its tip. I sign my name just beneath Benno’s. Unlike writing on those wooden boards, this is a very pleasant surface to write on.\n\n\n Writing on paper feels far better than those boards, after all…\n\n\n “Your turn, Lutz.”\n\n\n Lips pressed together in concentration, Lutz takes the pen from me, dips the pen in the inkwell, and writes his name below mine. The blockiness of his handwriting betrays how unused to writing he is, but he still writes his name clearly and legibly.\n\n\n “Now then…”\n\n\n “Aaah! Mister Benno?!”\n\n\n Benno abruptly pulls out a knife and slashes open his own finger. As Lutz and I watch on, startled, a drop of blood wells up on his fingertip. He smears it onto another finger, then presses down on top of his signature, sealing it with his blood. As he presses his finger tightly to the contract, the bright red blood is absorbed into the paper. In that instant, the blue ink of his signature abruptly turns deep black.\n\n\n This is some scary magic, yikes!\n\n\n “Right, and next is…”\n\n\n Benno looks over at me. I’m paralyzed with fear, staring at the bright red drop of blood that lingers on Benno’s knife. Lutz looks over at me, sighs, then takes out his own knife.\n\n\n “Give me your hand, Maine…”\n\n\n “Eek!”\n\n\n I shove my hands behind my back without thinking about it at all.\n\n\n “Maine, you can’t do it yourself, right?”\n\n\n “Th… that’s right, but…”\n\n\n Cutting open my own finger is scary, but having someone else do it is scary too. I really hate pain.\n\n\n “Whose idea was it to make this contract?” he says, patiently.\n\n\n “M… mine…”\n\n\n Steeling myself, I close my eyes tightly, then timidly extend my hands. Quickly, Lutz deftly slices open the tip of my left pinky. Blood starts to trickle down my finger, accompanied by a sharp, hot, stinging pain.\n\n\n “Spread that blood to your thumb, then press it into the contract,” says Benno.\n\n\n “Nnngh… guh!”\n\n\n Trying very hard not to cry, I smear some blood on my thumb, then press it firmly onto the contract, where I’ve signed it. Just like Benno’s, the ink immediately turns pitch black. While Mark stops the bleeding and wraps a small cloth around my pinky, Lutz unhesitatingly cuts open his own finger and leaves his own bloody seal on the contract.\n\n\n How can he do that without even flinching?! Isn’t that scary?!\n\n\n As soon as Lutz’s hand leaves the paper, the ink of the contract shines with a brilliant light, as if it’s burning. Spreading from the ink itself, a hole opens up in space, then snaps shut, taking the entire sheet of parchment with it. Even though I saw it happen right in front of my very own eyes, I can’t help but think it’s exactly like some CG you’d find in a movie.\n\n\n …Wow, this really is fantasy. I can’t believe that I’ve been living in a fantasy world!\n\n\n As I marvel over this strange new way of signing a contract, I suddenly notice that the contract has completely disappeared, and snap back to my senses.\n\n\n Aren’t I supposed to get a copy of this?\n\n\n “And, with that, the contract is complete. Violating is is a deadly matter, so don’t do it, okay?”\n\n\n “Deadly?!” I shout, terrified by his dreadful words.\n\n\n He looks down at me with a broad, amused smile. “Well, if you don’t violate it, you’ll do just fine. But, this is the kind of guarantee you wanted, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “…Thank you very much,” I say. “I’m very grateful.”\n\n\n In the end, I didn’t get a copy for myself.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n With the contract magic complete, Lutz and I leave Benno’s shop. By now, the sun is quite low in the sky, and I watch it slowly sink towards the horizon, its golden hue gradually dimming to red. Lutz and I walk back the way we came, through streets that seem so different in the evening glow.\n\n\n “It’s later than I thought,” I say. “Let’s get home quickly.”\n\n\n The people around us seem to be in a hurry to get home as well, walking with a bit of extra speed. As we’re carried along by the wave of traffic, I turn to Lutz.\n\n\n “Today was super exhausting, huh?”\n\n\n “…Yeah.”\n\n\n There’s still more material orders for us to write up, but, the orders that I spent so much time filling out today are going to be processed, we’ll get our materials, and we’ll be able to devote ourselves solely to making paper. On top of that, the contract magic means that Lutz and I have guaranteed our rights. When we finish perfecting our paper, we won’t get abruptly fired from the shop.\n\n\n “Now, we just need to make this paper, then we’re totally secure, Lutz!”\n\n\n “…Mm.”\n\n\n Lutz’s tongue is so heavy that I can barely hear his response before it disappears amongst the noise of the crowd. Usually, we talk a lot as we walk, to distract from the fact that I’m so slow. I wonder why his responses are so dull right now.\n\n\n I wonder if this wore him out more than going to the forest? Maybe memorizing letters and learning how to do calculations doesn’t really agree with him?\n\n\n I look over at Lutz as he walks beside me. His blond hair glows a brilliant red in the evening sun. As I look up at him, though, I can’t really make out the expression on his face through the shadow that falls across it.\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz. What’s wrong?”\n\n\n Even though I ask, Lutz doesn’t reply. He opens his mouth a little, looking like he almost wants to say something, but he immediately snaps it tightly shut. He hangs his head a little, as if he’s brooding over something. Like that, we walk in silence for a while.\n\n\n Lutz always slows down for me, acting like my pace-setter. I wonder if we’re walking at Lutz’s natural speed right now? I’m almost having to jog to keep up. He’s acting so differently compared to how he normally is. I’m getting a very bad feeling about this.\n\n\n “Wait, Lutz.”\n\n\n We stop in the central plaza, and Lutz immediately turns to look away from me. He presses his lips tightly together, then turns to look at me. His face, half-shrouded in shadow from the evening sun, is deadly serious. Looking like he’s gathered all of his resolve, he opens his mouth, and speaks in a cracked voice.\n\n\n “You… you’re Maine, right?”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n My breath catches in my throat. In an instant, all the blood in my body turns ice cold, and a heavy weight clamps down on my heart. The sounds of the bustling plaza fade away, replaced by a deafening ringing in my ears, pounding with each rush of blood through my veins.\n\n\n “If you’re really Maine, then… how could you talk like that?”\n\n\n “Like how?”\n\n\n “Like how you talked to the shopkeeper today. I didn’t even understand half of it. Hearing Maine talk about things I don’t know anything about, and keeping up with an adult… it’s strange.”\n\n\n The ringing in my ears continues. I gulp nervously as I listen to him.\n\n\n “Hey. You’re really Maine, right?” he says, looking for confirmation.\n\n\n I force down the prickling in my throat. I tilt my head way over to the side doubtfully, pretending like I have absolutely no idea what he’s talking about it.\n\n\n “Well, um… Lutz, do I look like I’m not Maine?”\n\n\n “…My bad. That was a weird thing to say. …I was just a little surprised to see you talking like an adult.”\n\n\n Lutz manages to put something like a smile on his face, then starts walking again.\n\n\n I stand there, mutely, strange thoughts turning over in my head. When I notice Lutz’s figure slowly growing smaller in the distance, I start moving forward as well.\n\n\n …I messed up, didn’t I.\n\n\n That’s right. I haven’t interacted with very many people so far. Since I don’t have any strength or stamina, I haven’t been useful for much of anything. I’ve been working as Otto’s assistant, but for that, I’ve been at most a child that’s uncommonly good at calculations, and none of the kids I know ever come in contact with me while I’m there.\n\n\n What I’ve done with Lutz has basically just been making clay tablets and carving wood. Even if my motives were strange, that’s still something a child could actually do, so my doing so wouldn’t be particularly suspicious.\n\n\n However, today I showed off a speaking ability as good as Benno’s, and fought very hard to secure a position for me and Lutz. I fought too hard. I’m sure that Lutz didn’t see in me today a trace of the weak, frail Maine that he has to protect from everything.\n\n\n As we start making paper in earnest, the number of arguments with adults I’ll need to have is only going to increase. When we’re having tools made for us, I’m going to need to be able to lay out proposals and give clear directions. I’m going to have to do more and more un-childlike things, but this is what I have to do in order to obtain paper for myself.\n\n\n I’m going to drift farther and farther away from the Maine that Lutz knows, I think. As Lutz and I work together, he’s only going to grow more and more convinced that I’m not actually Maine. This isn’t that far off.\n\n\n What would Lutz think if he knew this?\n\n\n What should I, who am not Maine, do now?\n\n\n As we return home, Lutz’s face is hidden in the shadows of twilight. I can’t bring myself to walk at his side."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Even long after we’ve returned home, Lutz’s words tumble around in my head. It looked like they were hard for him to say, but the fact that he was able to say them so clearly means that he holds some significant doubts in his heart.\n\n\n What would he say if he knew I really wasn’t Maine?\n\n\n “Give Maine back,” he would scream, “it’s your fault she’s gone!”, mixing his confusion, his anger, his fear into a deluge of verbal abuse. And if he tells my family about it, then I’d suddenly have nowhere to belong.\n\n\n I’d be driven from my home or even, in the worst case, subjected to this world’s equivalent of a witch hunt. Their religion may tell them that I’ve been possessed by a demon, so they’ll torture, maim, and kill me.\n\n\n I shiver as all of the things I’ve read about witch hunts and the tortures they involve flicker through my head.\n\n\n …I hate painful things. I hate scary things. If it looked like I was going to be tortured, I think I’d want to die instead.\n\n\n Getting driven out or getting tortured would both be terrible, but before that happens, I could just let myself be swallowed up by my fever. The only pain there would be whatever would seep through the feverish delirium as I died. I have a simple way to throw away my life at a single though without anyone being able to say otherwise.\n\n\n I’d rather die than be tortured.\n\n\n It’s hasty, but being carried away by fever sounds way more comfortable than being tortured. When I think about it like that, I can breathe just a little bit easier.\n\n\n On top of that, now that I’m thinking about it, what made me fight back against the fever and struggle to remain in this world was the fact that I’d made a promise to Lutz. I told myself that I had a promise to keep, and drove my fever away.\n\n\n I apologized to him, then introduced him to Otto, so I think I can tentatively say that I no longer have any regrets. After meeting with Benno and seeing that making paper is almost in my grasp, I realized that I wanted to make paper, and wanted to make books, but I don’t actually have any particular attachment to anything else in this world.\n\n\n It would be very simple for Lutz to avoid the me who is not Maine if I disgust him, but if he does that, then the paper-making project won’t succeed. If I can explain things clearly, then I think it’s likely that Lutz will come along quietly until we finish making paper and finish getting hired as apprentice merchants.\n\n\n If I can somehow manage to keep things together until we successfully make some paper, then I can die whenever I want.\n\n\n Now that I’ve prepared myself for that, I feel much more at ease. It’s not the most conclusive conclusion I’ve come up with, but it’s the best compromise I’ve come up with.\n\n\n I don’t particularly care when it’s time for me to die, but if I want to die without any regrets at all, I need to focus all of my efforts into making paper.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n I may have said that I’ve prepared myself for the worst, but that doesn’t mean that I have no reluctance at all to meet with Lutz again. The next morning, I meet him outside, just a little bit nervous.\n\n\n “I’m going to the forest today,” he says. “I’ve got to bring back a bunch of firewood.”\n\n\n My face lights up when I hear him say that. Today, I have to head to Benno’s shop to write up the remaining material orders and instruct him in the manufacturing process for my simple shampoo. If Lutz isn’t going to be there, this is the chance to get as many of the suspicious things that I need to do out of the way now, buying me some time.\n\n\n “Got it,” I reply. “I’m going to Benno’s shop today. I need to place the order for the paper mat, and I’m going to need to talk with him about where our supplies are going to be delivered.”\n\n\n “…You’re going by yourself?”\n\n\n “Yeah, I think so…?”\n\n\n If Lutz can’t come with me, then I’ve got no choice to go alone today. Plus, since today’s primary order of business will be to dealing with adults, then it’s very convenient if nobody I’m particularly close to is there today.\n\n\n “…You’re able to go by yourself?”\n\n\n “Oh, I’m all right.”\n\n\n Lutz clenches his fist tightly, looking like he wants to say something. However, he heads off to the forest without saying anything but “see you”.\n\n\n I’ve been to Benno’s shop once. Twice, if you include when I went to Otto’s home. Going there by myself shouldn’t be any trouble at all. Carrying my slate, slate pencils, and set of material forms with me in my tote bag, I set off for Benno’s shop.\n\n\n Alright, so! Let’s get as many things out of the way as I possibly can today!\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Good morning,” I say as I enter the shop. Merchant’s bustle about frantically, and customers constantly stream in and out of the shop. I make a beeline straight for Mark, the only person whose face I know. “Ah, Mister Mark! Would Mister Benno happen to be in? I’ve brought some more order forms with me.” “The master is busy right now, so I’d be happy to take them from you.”\n\n\n I pull out the set of order forms from my bag and place them in his outstretched hand, along with the ink and measuring tape he lent me.\n\n\n “I’ve filled out these orders, but as I mentioned yesterday, if possible I’d like to explain how I’d like them to be made. Would it be possible for us to decide on the best day to do so now?”\n\n\n “The lumber dealer will be more free during the morning. How about we head there now?”\n\n\n “Is that okay?” I ask. “The shop’s so busy, though.”\n\n\n Mark looks around the room at the other employees as they deal with customer after customer streaming through the shop. His mouth turns up into a smile, much like Otto’s, emanating a hint of a black aura.\n\n\n “The employees here are very well trained; I’m sure nobody would shed a tear if I were to step out for a moment.”\n\n\n There are a few of them that look like they’re on the verge of tears already, though?\n\n\n “Also,” he continues, “as Master Benno told me, your requests are a special case. I do not have anything else I need to be doing at the moment, so he has determined that I am well-suited to assist you in this. Please, do not worry about me.”\n\n\n “Ummm, then, thank you for helping!”\n\n\n Mark and I head out from the shop. It seems that the lumberyard we’re heading to is near the west gate, where the town market is. Since the west gate is close to the river, most large goods are brought in through there. It’s probably a very convenient place for a lumber dealer to set up his shop.\n\n\n “I had some things that I was hoping to ask Mister Benno, but since it seems that he’s busy, may I ask you instead, Mister Mark?”\n\n\n “What is it?”\n\n\n As we walk along the main road towards the central plaza, I start to ask about the things I wasn’t able to while we were in the store.\n\n\n “I was hoping that you could lend us a storehouse or workshop that we could use to store the materials we’ve ordered.”\n\n\n It’s all well and good that we can place order after order for whatever we need, but we have no place to put any of it.\n\n\n Mark blinks. “Where had you been planning to work before?” he asks, as if he hadn’t even considered the possibility that we didn’t already have a workshop.\n\n\n “We were planning on splitting storing the tools between our two houses, and then we were going to bring everything either to the well or to the river in the forest to work…”\n\n\n Originally, when we were planning on borrowing a pot from our families, we figured that we could essentially find substitutes for whatever we needed either in our houses or in the forest. We were thinking that we’d be able to beg our mothers for the ashes we’d need, and in the forest we’d be able to cut and then immediately use any wood we’d need.\n\n\n If we don’t have to substitute things, we save a lot of time and effort, but the sheer amount of baggage we’ll have immediately increases. We’ll also have a lot more raw material to store, beyond just what we’d be using in a single day. However, neither Lutz’s home nor mine has very much extra space in it, so I don’t think that either of our families would let us store a bunch of stuff not actually necessary for daily life in there.\n\n\n “There’s a limit to what we can store between the two of us,” I explain, “and it’s difficult to work like that. It would be best if we could borrow a workshop, so I thought I should ask you about it, since there’s nothing to lose. Wouldn’t you say this is also part of your initial investment?”\n\n\n As I talk, Mark rubs his temples, muttering about how unbelievable this is.\n\n\n “You were planning to do something much more unreasonable than I’d originally thought,” he says.\n\n\n “We haven’t had the support of any adults so far,” I remind him.\n\n\n There’s only so much that children can do without the cooperation of adults. Now that I’ve traded my simple shampoo for Benno’s support, I fully intend to use it to its maximum potential. If I let this opportunity slip, I don’t think I’ll have a second chance to try to make paper, so I can’t let things like restraint or discretion hold me back.\n\n\n “Hmm, I’ll see what I can do to secure a storehouse for you.”\n\n\n “Thank you very much. With you on our side, Mister Mark, I have a feeling we’ll definitely be able to get a storehouse for sure.”\n\n\n Based on what I saw last time, I think Mark might be something like Benno’s second-in-command or right-hand man. (Because he looks so butler-y.) If Mark is the one doing the negotiating, there’s no problem at all. He’ll definitely be able to get us a storehouse.\n\n\n “Do you have any special requirements for the storehouse?”\n\n\n “Ummm, since there are a lot of things that we’re going to need to go to the forest to do, it would be nice if it could be near the south gate. Besides that, as long as it has a roof and can hold the things we’re ordering, anything is good.”\n\n\n “I understand. …Ah, there they are. That lumberyard over there.”\n\n\n He points at something ahead of him, but at my height, I can’t see anything. I try hopping up and down, but I still can’t see over the crowds. I grab his hand and quicken my pace.\n\n\n “Right, let’s hurry!”\n\n\n Exuberantly, I turn towards where Mark is pointing, and break into a bit of a jog. In the next instant, my knees collapse, and my consciousness smash-cuts to black.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n When I come to, I’m in a completely unfamiliar room.\n\n\n Thanks to the thick covers of the bed I’m in, there’s no prickling from the straw mattress beneath me. It’s a very nice, comfortable bed. The ceiling is simple, but it’s been carefully kept clean. I don’t recognize it at all.\n\n\n “…Where, am I?”\n\n\n I sit up in bed and look around. Nearby, I see Corinna, working on some needlework. When she hears my voice, she stops working and immediately runs over to me.\n\n\n “Maine, you’re awake? Benno came in carrying you, saying that you’d suddenly collapsed in the street. I was so surprised! I heard from Otto that you used to not even be able to walk to even walk to the gate in the morning without having to rest until noon, so since you didn’t have a fever I thought you must just be tired and I let you sleep here for a while.”\n\n\n “Th… thank you very much for your care, ma'am! I am very sorry for the inconvenience!”\n\n\n Eeek! On top of the bed, I breathlessly prostrate myself before her in apology.1 It seems like I collapsed in a heap on the way to the lumberyard, so I was carried here to Corinna’s house thanks to Benno. I’ve really imposed heavily on these people. If my mother or Tory hear about this, there will be no end to their scolding.\n\n\n Aaaaaargh, I need to deeply apologize to Mark too! I’m sure he must have had a heart attack when I spontaneously collapsed in the middle of an ordinary conversation.\n\n\n I think I now know why I collapsed. First, I didn’t get very much sleep last night, since I stayed up far too late brooding over Lutz’s words. Then, I got a little bit overenthusiastic when I decided to finish as much of the negotiations as possible today when Lutz wasn’t around. On top of that, since it looks like my paper-making is starting to go really well, I’ve been so inspired that I haven’t actually been paying attention to the condition of my own body. And, since I didn’t have anybody near me to pay attention to my health for me, I didn’t have anyone to stop me from overdoing it.\n\n\n The spirit is willing, but the flesh is extremely weak. My body is a real piece of junk.\n\n\n “Maine, what are you doing? You don’t need to apologize for that. I’ll go contact my brother. I wanted to let your family know as well, but it seems that they weren’t around…”\n\n\n Today, I don’t think anyone should be at home, so it’s only natural that they’d be hard to get hold of. On top of that, my family thinks that Lutz is out there with me. I don’t think they would have even imagined that I’d go out to Benno’s shop by myself, then just spontaneously collapse. Just imagining my father, so worried that he flies into a rage, is terrifying to the point where I don’t even want to imagine the magnitude of my mother’s wrath when she finds out how much I’ve inconvenienced Corinna.\n\n\n “Ummm, Miss Corinna. C… can you please keep this a secret from my family?”\n\n\n “Maine…?”\n\n\n “My family thinks that I’m out with Lutz right now, so they’ll get really angry at him…”\n\n\n I try to use Lutz as a shield to negotiate an escape from my family’s wrath, but Corinna only smiles, a smile so sweetly radiant that it’s almost like that of a goddess.\n\n\n “Now, now, they’ll get mad at you anyway.”\n\n\n “Noooooo……”\n\n\n As I’m assaulted by expectations of how awful my scolding is going to be, loud footsteps approach before Benno bursts into the room. His reddish-brown eyes narrow sharply as he glares at me.\n\n\n “Little girl,” he says, in a low voice.\n\n\n “Fwah!!”\n\n\n With a snap, I sit up perfectly straight, kneeling on the bed.\n\n\n “You took some years off my life, there.”\n\n\n It feels like my lifespan is being eroded away by his threatening glare. All my conditioning takes over, and bow down, pressing my forehead into the mattress.\n\n\n “I am extremely sorry and beg your forgiveness!”\n\n\n “…What are you doing?”\n\n\n “This is a ‘dogeza’, how I show that my apology is of the utmost sincerity!”\n\n\n “Ah, I see.”\n\n\n He sits down next to me on the bed, ruffling his milk tea-colored hair as he scratches his head.\n\n\n “I’d heard a bit from Otto about how frail you were, but I had no idea it was this bad.”\n\n\n “Neither did I,” I reply.\n\n\n “Hm?”\n\n\n I got greedy, thinking that I could somehow manage to get by without Lutz there. When I decided that I’d be fine if I was only doing this much, I was unconsciously judging things based on my old body. Since I’m in Maine’s body now, it’s only natural that I’d collapse.\n\n\n “The problem was that I thought I could do anything, as long as I had the drive to do it.”\n\n\n “Well, okay,” he mutters to himself, turning to look at me. “From now on, only come here with that kid. I won’t approve if you go out alone again.”\n\n\n “…Yes, sir.”\n\n\n I didn’t expect that I’d collapse just because I didn’t have Lutz nearby to serve as my pacemaker. I figured that since I am now able to make it all the way to the forest under my own power, then I’d be fine walking anywhere as long I was in town. I made too light of my situation.\n\n\n “Go home for today. Mark’s worried about you, so take him with you.”\n\n\n My eyes go wide. “Umm?! That’s too much for me to ask. I need to apologize to him and then I can go home by myself!”\n\n\n I wave my hands frantically, trying to refuse. I couldn’t possibly impose on Mark any more than I have already. However, Benno’s face goes tight, and he glares at me with a dangerous glint in his eyes.\n\n\n “Didn’t I just say I don’t approve of you going out alone? Did you hear me the first time?”\n\n\n “…Yes, I did. I understand. I’ll go home with Mark, even if it upsets him. Ummm, but, since I’ve finally managed to see you, I’d like to tell you about how to make my 'simple’—”\n\n\n As I open my mouth to try and explain my main reason for coming here today, Benno grabs my head in one hand, a terrible look on his face.\n\n\n “Now! Lis! Ten! Here!”\n\n\n “Yes?!”\n\n\n “I, told, you, to go home!”\n\n\n “Eeek!”\n\n\n As he yells at me, my head firmly in his grip, I tremble in fear. Tears well up in my eyes on reflex as I look up at him, but in the recesses of my mind, a dispassionate thought comes to life. Ah, I see. This is what truly being yelled at is like.\n\n\n “From now on, you are prohibited from entering my shop without that boy with you! If your memory works at all, remember this!”\n\n\n “I got it! I’ll remember! Ow! Owowowowow!!”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n After that, I had a bit of a discussion with Mark about whether I could walk home or whether he’d carry me, but he first said, kindly, “I don’t want my heart to stop like that again, so please come along quietly,” then, when I tried to insist on walking, he asked, “did your apology just now mean nothing?” and I decided there was no way I would win.\n\n\n Giving up my futile resistance, I allowed Mark to pick me up, and was carried home. When we got to my home, my family saw me being carried by Mark and extracted a report of my actions for the day from him and, as I expected, they got angry. In the middle of their enormous lecture, my fever flared up with full force, and I was stuck in bed for two more days.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “So, basically, since I was such a hindrance and made everyone so mad, please come with me to the shop today.”\n\n\n The day after my fever subsided, I explain my circumstances to Lutz, and ask if he’d accompany me to the shop. He stares at me, completely stunned, then lets out a huge, huge sigh.\n\n\n “Haaahhh~… Didn’t I tell you? I asked if you really could make it there, and you said it was okay. That wasn’t okay at all, was it?”\n\n\n “Is… is, uh, is that what you meant? I was thinking you were asking if I remembered how to get there… Lutz?!”\n\n\n “Ahahaha! What kind of crazy world do you live in that you’d think that’s what I meant? I’m always thinking about your health, aren’t I?!”\n\n\n I pout at Lutz, lips pursed, as he bends over in riotous laughter. He looks up at me, smiling so wide that it looks like his face might break.\n\n\n “If you’re collapsing like that, you really shouldn’t go there without me,” he says.\n\n\n “Yeah. Mister Benno actually banned me from entering his shop if I don’t have you there too.”\n\n\n “Ahahaha! You got banned?!”\n\n\n I’ve been reminded of just how useless I am, so I’m feeling rather depressed right now, but for some reason Lutz is in an excellent mood. I’m glad he’s not in a bad mood, but I kind of want an explanation.\n\n\n I’d stayed up so late, worrying so much about what he’d said, and I thought that seeing him again was going to be so difficult, so why is he acting like he always does?!\n\n\n “Hey, Maine. Stop sulking, let’s get out of here.”\n\n\n Just like always, Lutz starts acting like my big brother, pulling me along as we start walking towards Benno’s shop.\n\n\n “Lutz, what did you get when you went to the forest the other day?”\n\n\n “Firewood and some bamboo. Didn’t you say that you wanted to whittle some bamboo down into something so that you could show it to some craftsmen?”\n\n\n “Now that you say it, I did. I forgot!”\n\n\n After Mark wasn’t able to understand what I was talking about, no matter how I described it or how many diagrams I drew on my slate, we’d decided that Lutz and I should come up with a physical example. I’d completely forgotten.\n\n\n “Hey, hey, keep it together!”\n\n\n “Lutz, you’re here to keep it together for me, so everything’s just fine.”\n\n\n In a world without notebooks, there’s no way I can remember literally everything. I’m a notebook fiend. I used to always carry a notebook with me, and write down literally everything so that I wouldn’t forget it. If I took good enough notes, it wouldn’t matter if I couldn’t remember something, so I guess I became so reliant on always having my notes on hand that my memory might actually have been pretty bad.\n\n\n As I tell him that we’re not going to forget anything if we’ve got each other, Lutz suddenly looks like he’s almost about to cry.\n\n\n “…Um, Maine, when I saw that you’re so good at writing, and that you can do all that math, and that you can talk with the adults about all those things I don’t understand, I got really sad.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n “I started thinking, what am I really good for? Like, maybe I’m not going to be any help in that shop at all.”\n\n\n There’s no way that anyone in that shop would expect a kid who hasn’t even been baptized to be immediately useful. Lutz can already write his name, and he studied very hard, so I’m sure they think highly of him. It seems like he didn’t notice that at all, and was only depressing himself by comparing himself to me.\n\n\n As I console him, telling him that there’s no need to compare himself to me so much, he looks up at me, smiling just a little bit.\n\n\n “But hey, Maine, you collapse a lot, and even though you’re really smart you forget things, and you’re not strong at all, and you’re really tiny, and now that I think about it there’s a lot of things that you actually can’t do. Like, you’re even banned from going to that shop without me there too…”\n\n\n “That’s so mean! There’s some things I can do, you know!”\n\n\n As I protest the way he’s describing me, for whatever reason he clutches his stomach, nearly falling over as he’s laughing so hard. He calms down after a while, then puts his hand on my head, ruffling my hair.\n\n\n “The other day, when I said that you weren’t really Maine, that was really mean of me. I’m sorry.”\n\n\n “…Oh. You were being… mean.”\n\n\n That’s kind of deflating. I took Lutz’s words so unbelievably seriously, but it seems like he was just being mean. The lingering threads of tension that coiled around me suddenly slacken.\n\n\n “…I thought you really hated me, I’m so glad…”\n\n\n “Nah, I don’t hate you. Hey, let’s keep moving!”\n\n\n I take Lutz’s outstretched hand, and we walk together down the street. My usual daily life feels like it’s coming back around.\n\n\n “Good morning,” I say, as we enter the shop.\n\n\n Mark looks up as we enter, then leads us to the back of the shop, where Benno is. He looks up at us, his eyes sharp as ever, rubbing his temples.\n\n\n “Kid,” he says, looking at Lutz, “taking care of this unreasonable girl is now your absolute maximum priority. This is your most important job, that nobody else can do. Got it? My heart can’t take it, thinking about this kid could be walking around out there, then with no warning at all suddenly collapse in the middle of the street.”\n\n\n Lutz blinks as Benno, displeased, delivers his orders. He points at himself, doubtfully.\n\n\n “…I’m the only one who can take care of her?”\n\n\n “That’s right. Besides you and her family, is there anyone that actually looks after this unreasonable girl? Know anyone?”\n\n\n “Nope.”\n\n\n “How about anyone in this shop?”\n\n\n “No, sir.”\n\n\n Lutz immediately shakes his head at each of Benno’s questions. I think it might not be just my imagination that his face is practically shining and there’s a hint of a proud gleam in his pale green eyes.\n\n\n Nngh, I want to grab those proud cheeks and stretch them out.\n\n\n “Well then, kid, I’ve got a few questions for you. Today, can this girl walk out to the south gate?”\n\n\n “If we’re watching our pace, then yeah. Since the south gate is near where we live, if she starts feeling bad we can also just go home.”\n\n\n This is an everyday thing, but as both Lutz and my family well know, my physical condition is downright deplorable. I’ve been working to gradually train myself up, but no matter how I try I just can’t get my stamina to increase.\n\n\n Even though, as a kid, I should be steadily growing up.\n\n\n Benno looks down at me, the girl whose growth rate is terrible even though she’s been training hard, then picks up the bell on top of his desk and rings it once. The door opens with a click, and Mark enters.\n\n\n “You called for me, Master Benno?”\n\n\n “Looks like she can walk there if she watches her speed. Lead them there, please.”\n\n\n “Understood, sir.”\n\n\n “Huh?” I ask. “Where are we going? I thought the lumberyard was near the west gate?”\n\n\n I didn’t think we had any business that required us to head towards the south gates. I blink, uncertainly, as Benno shrugs his shoulders.\n\n\n “Mark told me about your request for a storehouse. I’ll lend you one that’s down by the south gates.”\n\n\n “Really? Thank you very much!”\n\n\n As I thank him excitedly, he lets out a little sigh.\n\n\n “This isn’t for your sake, it’s for the boy’s. It’d be very difficult for him if he has to lug all of the tools everywhere while also looking after you.”\n\n\n “Whaaat?! I can carry things too, you know! I’ve gotten a little bit stronger, lately.”\n\n\n As I try to assert my own strength, all three of them simultaneously open their mouths in rebuttal.\n\n\n “You shouldn’t do anything rash, kid, just go along with it.”\n\n\n “I’m the one who does the lifting, so don’t do anything that’ll make you sick again.”\n\n\n “Since you won’t have to carry anything, please look after your health.”\n\n\n I, however, refuse. I’m not just going to go along with it. I promised Tory. I’m going to do the things that I can do, and I’m going to increase that number. I’m going to do my own things by my own strength, and I’m going to work hard until I can do the things that I can’t do right now.\n\n\n With a meek expression, I nod in assent, but Lutz immediately reaches out to grab my cheeks, staring me down.\n\n\n “Maine, that face… you were just pretending to listen, weren’t you?”\n\n\n How did that slip out?!\n\n\n I look up at him, surprised, as he pinches my cheeks. Benno and Mark exchange glances, then nod.\n\n\n From that day on, Lutz had a very important role in Benno’s shop: “Maine Duty”.\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. Dogeza is a very Japanese way to express your deepest apologies or show the highest deference by kneeling on the floor and bowing so deeply that your head touches the ground."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n After we leave Benno’s room, Lutz and I are led out of the shop by Mark and towards a warehouse near the south gates. It seems like the south gates are where a lot of craftsmen work, so there are a lot of warehouses in this part of the town. Also, there are a lot more water wells around here than in the residential districts, since craftsmen likely use a lot of water in their work.\n\n\n The warehouse that Mark leads us to has a well right next to it. It’s not a particularly large space; at a glance, it looks to be about three by three and a half meters wide.1 It looks like it was originally used for workers to store raw materials in, with rough wooden shelves nailed onto the walls. The inside has been roughly swept out, so while it’s still a little dusty it doesn’t seem like we’ll need to do any thorough cleaning. As I look around, I notice that both a pot and a bag full of something have already been left in a corner.\n\n\n “When the items you order arrive at the shop, we’ll send an employee to bring them here. Yesterday, they brought the pot and the ash you ordered; they are in the corner there. Today, the large tub and the stone weight will be arriving. Please be here when they arrive.”\n\n\n As I look at the black pot that Mark is pointing at, my heart fills with gratitude for Benno’s assistance. A pot, something that Lutz and I could absolutely never have gotten on our own, is here.\n\n\n “Whoa, a pot!!” I exclaim. “Lutz! Can you carry this?”\n\n\n “Yeah, if it’s this size. I could also strap it to my back, instead.”\n\n\n “Well, let’s measure it! We need to figure out how big the steamer’s going to be.”\n\n\n I have a set of ordering materials, that I borrowed from Benno’s shop, in my tote bag. As I rush to take out the measuring tape, Lutz casually takes it from my hands.\n\n\n “…Sure, let’s measure it, but let’s calm down a little first. If you get too excited, you’ll get sick again.”\n\n\n “Urgh…”\n\n\n Mark smiles wryly as he watches our exchange.\n\n\n “If there’s no problems with this warehouse, then I’ll be returning to the shop today. Tomorrow morning, I plan to go to the lumberyard, so please make absolutely sure you’ve finished measuring and ordering everything you’ll need by then. …Hmm, I’ll leave the shop at the third bell, so I think I should arrive at the central plaza shortly after that.”\n\n\n “Yes, understood!” I say. “Thank you very much for everything so far.”\n\n\n Next, he takes out a set of chains and a key, a serious expression on his face.\n\n\n “I’ll leave this key with you for now. This is the key to this warehouse. When you close up here, please make very sure you don’t forget this. Then, after you’ve locked up, you need to bring this key back to the shop. Lutz, it’s alright for you to do this by yourself. All right?”\n\n\n “Yes,” I reply.\n\n\n After handing the heavy key to Lutz, Mark turns smoothly on his heel, then exits the warehouse.\n\n\n “Lutz, shall we get started?”\n\n\n This warehouse doesn’t seem to have been used very recently, so it has neither chairs nor any boxes we might sit on. This isn’t the kind of place we can really take a break.\n\n\n “How about we bring in the stuff we have already? The frame we made, the bamboo, the nails…”\n\n\n “Yeah, that sounds good. The things we definitely have to do today are figuring out the size of the steamer, and then the size of the wood we’re going to use, right? I want to go over what I’ve got down on these orders so far to make sure I’m not forgetting any more lumber we need… after that, we could start on making bamboo strips?”\n\n\n “If we’re cutting and shaving bamboo like that, we’ll need some tools for that too.”\n\n\n I write down a list of the things we need to do today on my slate, then prop it up against the wall of the warehouse. This way, I think we won’t forget anything.\n\n\n Lutz and I start heading home to get our things and bring them back to the warehouse. I’m completely unfamiliar with the part of town we’re in, so I’m very lost, but Lutz seems to know exactly where we are as he casually leads us through twisting, narrow alleyways. This warehouse is supposed to be close to the south gate and to my home, but where are we? As the question bounces around in my head, we turn a corner and arrive home. It’s very close, much to my relief, since it’ll be easy on my stamina.\n\n\n “Okay,” I say, “I’ll go up and get everything in a basket and bring it back down here.”\n\n\n “Got it.”\n\n\n All I’ve got at my house is the nails. Since Lutz’s family works in the construction and woodworking industries, it’s very likely that if we’d left the bag of nails there, it’s likely that someone in his family would have thought it was their own bag and taken them off. Similarly, if we left the frame or the bamboo we’ve collected at my place, they’d probably be mistaken for firewood again and burned up, so we left those at Lutz’s.\n\n\n I put the bag of nails and my knife into the basket. As an afterthought, I grab a dust rag and a broom, too. Since we don’t have anything to use as a chair, at the very least, I want to sweep out part of the floor and lay down a cloth so that we have someplace to sit.\n\n\n When I head back downstairs, Lutz is already waiting for me, with all sorts of wooden things sticking out of his basket.\n\n\n “Lutz, what’s that?”\n\n\n “Oh, this is something Ralph messed up making the other day. I thought we could maybe use it as a chair for now.”\n\n\n “Heh heh, I also brought some things so we can sit down.”\n\n\n We head back to the warehouse, put the bag of nails on a shelf, and set the bamboo in a corner. I take out the tape measure, and the two of us measure the pot’s dimensions and decide on the size of the steamer that we’ll use, then write down on my slate the size of the wood that we’ll be steaming.\n\n\n “This look okay?”\n\n\n “Yeah.”\n\n\n There’s a lot of wood that we need to request from the lumberyard. We need the components for the steamer, the heavy stick we’ll use to beat the extracted fibers, the large, flat board we’ll need for the paper bed, another flat, but relatively thin board we can stick the paper to as it dries, the bamboo that we’ll need to make bamboo strips, and, of course, the wood we’ll be making the actual paper out of.\n\n\n While I double-check to make sure I have everything written down on the order form, I start wondering about what sort of characteristics we want in our wood. Do we want a hard or a soft wood, an old or a young wood?\n\n\n “Alright,” says Lutz, “let’s do the bamboo strips.”\n\n\n “Sure. Can you make them small enough?”\n\n\n “Hmm, last time they were still pretty big. I wonder how we can make thinner ones?”\n\n\n Under Lutz’s direction, we start work on making the bamboo strips. It’s relatively straightforward to make the rough cuts with single, powerful strokes, but paring them down to something more slender looks like it’s a much slower, painstaking process.\n\n\n “Let me try, too. If it’s fine work, I think I can do it.”\n\n\n I take out my own knife, select a slender piece of bamboo, and try to cut it down. Halfway through, though, it suddenly snaps in two. There’s not enough length left on either side for us to be able to use it without it rattling around.\n\n\n “This is really hard,” I say.\n\n\n “Yeah, it really is,” says Lutz.\n\n\n I look at the few, rattly strips we’ve complete, then at the frame we have to fill, judging how much we’ll need to fill it.\n\n\n I really want to leave this work to people who can actually do it. The two of us have neither enough time nor skill.\n\n\n As we continue to work, a call come from outside. “I’ve brought your goods!”\n\n\n An employee from Benno’s shop has arrived, carrying a large tub and a stone weight that’s light enough for Lutz to lift. I have him put them in the corner, next to the pot.\n\n\n “Maine,” says Lutz, “our delivery came, so let’s call it quits for today.”\n\n\n As Benno’s employee leaves to head back to the shop, Lutz starts tidying up his tools. Since it’s only just about noontime, though, I still think I have plenty of stamina to keep working.\n\n\n “I can keep going, you know?”\n\n\n “…Tomorrow looks pretty difficult, so you should get some rest today. Hey, didn’t you say you needed to do the cooking today?”\n\n\n “Oh, that’s right.”\n\n\n My turn to cook came around while I was stuck in bed, so Tory covered for me. So, today, it’s my turn.\n\n\n “Also,” he continues, “since I’m going to the lumberyard tomorrow, I have to make sure I get all of my stuff done first.”\n\n\n “Your stuff?”\n\n\n “I need to make sure I get my share of tomorrow’s chores done today. So, Maine, go home. I’ll go run the key back to the shop after that.”\n\n\n “Got it.”\n\n\n I nod in agreement, painfully aware of how much of a burden I am, then start putting everything back in order.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, shortly after the third bell rings, we meet Mark in the central plaza, then head towards the lumberyard. It seems like Benno’s shop is the busiest between when it opens just before the second bell and when the merchants start calming down at around the third bell.\n\n\n Since Lutz is here with us today, I don’t collapse on the way there, and we make it to the lumberyard safely. Logs are gathered in piles here or leaned against the walls, a scene not entirely unlike something I’ve seen in Japan. However, since everything that would usually be done via machine is instead done by hand, there’s a huge number of very well-muscled buff dudes wandering around, yelling at each other as they haul wood around and cut it down to size. It’s a very lively scene. Almost excessively lively, to the point where I’m a little bit scared.\n\n\n “Ahh,” says Mark, “Foreman, it’s been a while.”\n\n\n “Oh! Mark, huh? That Benno kid’s doing pretty well, isn’t he?”\n\n\n “Ah, yes. He’s doing quite well. For today’s business, though, these two are looking for some wood…”\n\n\n The foreman sports a bristly mustache, peppered with gray, and a shiny bald head. He comes out to greet Mark, who tells him about our search.\n\n\n “The little girl and the kid, huh? What the heck kinda wood do you need?”\n\n\n His burly muscles don’t match his age at all. As he stares down at me, my breath catches in my throat with a squeak.\n\n\n “Umm, I’m looking for wood so that I can make a steamer…”\n\n\n “Huuuh? What kind of wood’s that?”\n\n\n He repeats his question, a dubious expression on his face, leaving me at a total loss for words. I’m pretty sure that Lutz and Mark understand what I’ve been referring to when I talk about steamers, but I wonder if the foreman doesn’t actually know about them? Or, maybe, do I have to actually tell him the specific kinds of wood that I need?\n\n\n “Ummm, I need something that keeps its shape even when there’s a lot of water vapor… ah, no, when there’s a lot of steam; a hard, dried wood. Could you please tell me what kinds of wood like that you have?”\n\n\n “Hoh? A hard, dried wood, hm. I think I have an idea of what you might need.”\n\n\n The foreman nods to himself, then lists off the names of three different kinds of wood.\n\n\n “We’ve got zwan, turaka, and pedithry. What’ll it be?”\n\n\n “What will it be, you ask… Lutz, do you know?”\n\n\n Even though he’s listed off some potential candidates, I have no idea at all what any of those are. I look over my shoulder at Lutz for help.\n\n\n “Hmm? Zwan’s the easiest to work with, right?”\n\n\n “Well then,” says Mark, “let’s go with zwan, then. You’ve decided on the sizes you’ll need, correct?”\n\n\n “Yes!” I say, pulling the order forms from my tote bag. Mark looks them over, double checking to make sure there’s no errors.\n\n\n “Hmm,” he says, “there are no problems here. So, foreman, please cut zwan to the dimensions listed here, then deliver it to the shop.”\n\n\n “Alright!”\n\n\n He glances over the order form, then hands it to a nearby young buff dude.\n\n\n “Um,” I say, “next I need a thick board and a stand to put it on, also out of a wood that won’t warp when it’s wet.”\n\n\n “I can sell you the wood, but if you want it put together into a stand you’re gonna need to do it yourself or find a furniture maker. You want these in zwan, too?”\n\n\n “Yes, please,” I say with a big nod, handing him the order form for the thick board. He huffs as he looks it over, then I pull out another form to hand to him.\n\n\n “This sure is a lot,” he says.\n\n\n “I’ve still got more,” I reply. “This is for two boards, which need to be able to get wet, and also need to be thin.”\n\n\n “How thin?” he says, with a frown. “If you cut wood too thin, it’ll start bending when you put any weight on it, y'know?”\n\n\n I hum tonelessly, digging through my memories. When the image of the board that we’ll be sticking the paper onto pops into my mind, I clap my hands together in inspiration, then take out my slate from its bag. The slate pencil clacks against the surface as I draw a diagram.\n\n\n “Ummm, it’s going to be set in a frame and reinforced from the back like this, so something thick enough that it won’t bend when that happens. I’m worried about the weight; I know I’m not going to be able to lift, it, but if Lutz can’t…”\n\n\n “I’d be a failure of a man if I couldn’t lift something that big,” interjects Lutz.\n\n\n There’s no way that Lutz could even begin to compare himself to that brawny foreman. A little anxious, I turn to face him, but before I can open my mouth he’s already wearing an unpleasant frown.\n\n\n “I’m a man,” he says, “so it’s all right.”\n\n\n If Lutz talks too big now, he’s going to wind up paying for it later, but if I say anything now, I’ll only be wounding his masculine pride, so I let it slide.\n\n\n “Next,” I say, “we’ll need a squared timber out of a hard wood, like a club, or like the rod you use when you’re beating your laundry. This also needs to be a size and weight that Lutz can carry and swing around.”\n\n\n “This sounds completely different than a laundry rod, though? What are you hitting?”\n\n\n Those were the two things that came to mind when I was thinking of things that you use to hit other things, but it seems that since a club is a weapon and a laundry rod is something mothers hit their washing with, the materials must be very different.\n\n\n “Wood fibers,” I reply. “We’ll be boiling them until they’re limp, then beating them until they’re soft like cotton.”\n\n\n “What’re you making, again?”\n\n\n I cross my fingers in front of my mouth, making an X. “Sorry, but I can’t tell you.”\n\n\n The foreman huffs again. “Getting the hardness and the weight balanced’ll be important, huh. If we’re gonna get this right, what kind of surface are you going to be doing this on? Stone? Wood? There’s more variables on top of that, too, yeah?”\n\n\n All of my blood rushes to my head. I had completely forgotten that we’d need some sort of chopping block built that we could beat the fibers on top of.\n\n\n “…I, I didn’t think about that. R, r, right, we need a block for that too! Can we order those as a set, please? I can write out the order right now!”\n\n\n “Yeah, if you wanted to do it as a set you could add that to the order here, but… little girl, you’re going to write it?”\n\n\n “Yes, I will…?”\n\n\n My head pounds with the realization of my thoughtless mistake. Trying desperately to recover somehow, I immediately take out the measuring tape, the ink, and the pen from the order-writing set, then I add to the form the dimensions of the chopping block, underneath the description of the stick itself.\n\n\n “Mister,” I say to the foreman, “will this do?”\n\n\n “Yeah, that’ll do. Is that your entire order?”\n\n\n “No, next is… um, is there a kind of wood that has really long, tough fibers? If possible, we’re looking for wood with sticky fibers, but if you can’t then it’s okay as long as they can stick together well enough and we can get a lot of them from the wood. I heard that year-old wood is the best for this; after the second year the fibers get too hard and brittle so they get really hard to work with. So, we’re looking for a young, soft wood.”\n\n\n As I list out the characteristics of the wood that would be easiest to use in paper, the foreman’s reaction isn’t very good. He tugs on his mustache in thought, frowning.\n\n\n “Hmmm. Wood that young isn’t very useful, so we don’t actually carry anything like that.”\n\n\n It seems that this lumberyard doesn’t deal in year-old woods unless they get a special order for it.\n\n\n “Um, then, if you have any idea what kinds of wood might have those traits, could you please at least give us a list of them? We don’t know exactly what kind of wood we’ll be using, so we can gather the small quantities we need ourselves to test. When we find out what we do need, though, can we order it through you?”\n\n\n “I can’t say until I know how much you’re ordering. If it’s too little, it’s hard for me to make any money.”\n\n\n “I understand. …Lutz, could you please find out about the names of these trees and where we can find them? I don’t think I could tell them apart, myself.”\n\n\n It looks like we’re going to have to gather our raw materials ourselves after all, at least to start. Once we get our prototype finished we’ll have figured out what kind of wood we’re going to want to use, so then when we start mass production we’ll be able to place an order for it.\n\n\n Lutz goes off with one of the young buff dudes to learn about the different kinds of wood and how to distinguish them. Meanwhile, I take out a bamboo strip to show the foreman and ask some questions.\n\n\n “Ah, that’s right,” I say, “We need bamboo strips like this; do you have bamboo here?”\n\n\n “Not that much, but yeah, we do,” he says, pointing towards one of the many piles of lumber. There, I see the familiar shapes of bamboo poles stacked up.\n\n\n “Could you make these bamboo strips here?”\n\n\n “Fine work like that is a craftsman’s job. Ask a craftsman.”\n\n\n “A craftsman, okay. Thank you very much. Um, that’s everything in my order for today.”\n\n\n “Alright,” he says, looking over the stack of order forms. “When it’s all done, you want it sent to Benno’s shop, right?”\n\n\n All of the order forms I handed him are being placed in Benno’s name. Since we have a contract saying that he’ll provide the initial material investment in exchange for my simple shampoo, it seems that Benno’s the one doing all of the actual ordering. It seems that the formality of having Benno purchase and receive the goods, then have them delivered to us is important to the way the contract magic works.\n\n\n “Yes, please. Thank you very much for your assistance.”\n\n\n The foreman heads back off to his duties. As I wait for Lutz to come back, I stick my hand into my tote bag and feel around, making sure I didn’t accidentally forget to turn a form in. All I have left are the order for the stand, which I need to find a furniture maker for, and the order for the bamboo strips, which I need to find a craftsman for.\n\n\n Hmmm, what should we do about the stand for the paper bed? To be honest, a stand like that doesn’t seem like the kind of thing I need to expressly go to a furniture maker in order to get.\n\n\n “…Mister Mark,” I say, “Do you have any wooden boxes at the shop that we could use for a table? I think it would be wasteful to ask a furniture maker to make a custom one.”\n\n\n “Ah, I understand. I’ll make to find some for you. How many do you need?”\n\n\n “We’re going to need two that are the same size so that we can put a board on top of them. I’d be really happy if we could get two or three more, but the size of those doesn’t really matter.”\n\n\n Mark readily agrees, since this will be far cheaper than ordering something custom from a furniture maker. When Lutz comes back, Mark says that it’s time to split up for the day.\n\n\n “Perhaps we should go to the craftsman’s workshop another day. I’d be unable to get in contact with one today, so shall we part ways here?”\n\n\n “Alright,” I say. “Thank you very much.”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, we head to the forest to gather firewood. While we’re at it, I try to figure out if there was any trees out here that might work for making paper, but since Lutz is ultimately far more knowledgable about this than I am, I basically just foist the entire task off onto him. I mean, every single tree I see looks just like every other tree to me! Sure, there’s differences in the color and texture of their bark, but there’s so many different variations, I can’t actually remember any at all.\n\n\n Then, when we stop by the shop to borrow the warehouse key so that we can store what we’ve found, Mark informs us that he was able to get in contact with a craftsman who could help us.\n\n\n Mister Mark, you’re amazing at your job. Such a quick worker.\n\n\n Thanks to Mark, five days after our visit to the lumberyard, we’re able to meet with a craftsman. As usual, we meet in the central plaza around the third bell, then head towards our destination. It seems that since this craftsman’s workshop gets a lot of traffic from other workers, it’s located near the south gates.\n\n\n Unlike the foreman at the lumberyard, this craftsman is, if I had to describe him, a rather slender man. He has the muscles he needs to do his job, but the rest of his physique is the embodiment of minimizing unnecessary things. His ashen hair reaches down to his back, loosely tied into a ponytail so that it doesn’t get in the way of his work.\n\n\n “What’s the job?”\n\n\n He scans me up and down with his sharp eyes, the picture of the neurotic artisan. I reflexively cling to Mark’s pant leg.\n\n\n “I’d like thin bamboo strips like this,” I say, pulling one of the ones we’ve already made out of my tote bag and handing it to him. “I asked at the lumberyard if they could make it, but the foreman said I should go see a craftsman…”\n\n\n He turns the imprecisely cut strip over in his hands, his mouth pursed.\n\n\n “Do you need it to be wavy like this?”\n\n\n “I tried to make it as straight as possible…”\n\n\n “Hm, if I account for your lack of skill, it’s clear what you’re looking for. Got it. Those are the ingredients?”\n\n\n The craftsman points at the bamboo that Lutz has in a basket on his back, which we retrieved from the warehouse on our way here. We take it out of the basket and stack it up for him.\n\n\n “That all you need?”\n\n\n “Um! I’m hoping that you could make a ‘bamboo mat’, do you think you can?”\n\n\n I draw a diagram on my slate, then use the one bamboo strip I have as a prop as I try to explain what I’m looking for. Despite my crude explanation, it seems that the craftsman somehow manages to capture the image of what I’m looking for.\n\n\n “That’s going to be a real pain to make, but I can’t say I can’t make it.”\n\n\n “Really? Amazing!”\n\n\n “But, I can’t make that work if I don’t have a strong enough thread. Go get me some of that before you place the order.”\n\n\n He flicks his hands at us as he talks, shooing us away. However, there’s no way I can let myself be driven out like this. After all, I have literally zero idea as to what kind of thread is going to be tough enough to work.\n\n\n “Umm, I’m sorry, but I don’t really know what thread is strong enough for you. Would you be able to help me look, please?”\n\n\n “I’m free to head to the thread wholesaler right now, so I can, sure.”\n\n\n “Let’s go!”\n\n\n I lift my fist enthusiastically to the sky. I’m quite happy that this disagreeable-looking craftsman suddenly said something so cooperative.\n\n\n “Oi, Maine,” scolds Lutz from behind me, grabbing me by the top of the head. Pouting, I spin around to face him. He glares at me, his green eyes narrowed in irritation.\n\n\n “Don’t be so rash. You’re the first one who’s gonna pay for that, you know.”\n\n\n “It seems that today she would like to be carried in my arms today as well, doesn’t it?” says Mark.\n\n\n “Eek?!” I say.\n\n\n I don’t know if he clearly remembers how much I hated having been carried all the way home last time; his pleasant smile shows no indication either way as he approaches me. As I cautiously back up, the craftsman, sounding irritated, speaks up.\n\n\n “Are we going or not? Pick one!”\n\n\n “We’re going, of course,” says Mark. “Maine said so after all. Right?”\n\n\n Mark captures me, lifts me up in his arms, and hauls me off to the thread wholesaler. Since we don’t have to worry about watching my walking pace, there’s a big difference in our speed. I’m quietly surprised that, even though I’m being held in his arms, it’s a remarkably smooth ride. I let out a dissatisfied sigh, my face near his shoulder.\n\n\n I’d planned to keep forging on, but I just wound up being a bother again…\n\n\n Since the thread wholesaler is along the workers’ streets, it’s not actually very far away. Even still, as someone who’s mentally an adult, being carried in someone’s arms like this makes me want to flee far, far away. When we arrive at the wholesaler, he finally lets me down, letting me walk on my own two feet while in the store.\n\n\n “Whoa, there’s so much thread here!”\n\n\n “Yep,” mutters the craftsman, “because it’s a wholesaler. For thread.”\n\n\n Despite his quip, I’m still amazed by the spectacle of the huge quantity of thread that’s gathered here. In this city, the stalls in the town market don’t carry anything more than what they can reasonably sell to individual customers, and the shops on the first floor of buildings along the main streets have limited amounts of merchandise on display, just enough for samples, to minimize the damage that a robber or a burglar might cause. It’s very rare to see so much of a commodity crammed into a space like this.\n\n\n “Which of these are the tough ones?” I ask.\n\n\n In Japan, the thread we use to when making bamboo keta mats is spun from raw silk. Here, I don’t know if silkworms, let alone silk, actually exist, so I don’t know how to pick a strong enough string.\n\n\n “Silk from a spinne would be the strongest, especially any harvested during their breeding season in the fall. However, it’s expensive, yeah?”\n\n\n I glance at Mark questioningly, and he returns my glance. I’m not the one actually in charge of the money. Mark is, as he’s been entrusted with the final say over the contents of Benno’s purse.\n\n\n “Spinne silk would be fine, but it shouldn’t be necessary to be particular about it being from the fall, is it?”\n\n\n “…Yeah, you’re right, but is spinne silk really okay?”\n\n\n “Yes, it would be.”\n\n\n It seems like spinne silk is a very highly-priced item. The craftsman slowly, gingerly takes down a spool from a shelf full of the most expensive, highest quality goods. Startled, I exchange another glance with Mark.\n\n\n “However,” he says, “if there are complaints about the final product, I will not forgive your mistakes. I trust that you’ll finish this task to perfection.”\n\n\n Mark briefly looks over the order form that I’ve retrieved from my tote bag, then hands it and my sample bamboo stick to the craftsman with a broad smile.\n\n\n “I leave this in your capable hands.”\n\n\n “…Yeah.”\n\n\n Two postcard-sized mats to fit the paper frames. With that, all of the orders for our tools have been successfully placed, without any trouble at all. I breathe a sigh of relief.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n After that, I wind up playing house-sitter at the warehouse for a while, watching as the goods we ordered start to arrive. As that happens, Lutz and I work to build our tools using the parts that have reached us already.\n\n\n All the while, we routinely head into the forest to do our gathering, and although we make sure to help around the house enough that we won’t get scolded by our families, we steadily gather our raw materials.\n\n\n We don’t yet know if we’re going to use edil fruit or the bodily fluids from a slamo bug as a substitute for sunset hibiscus sap, so we start by trying edil fruits. It seems that in the autumn, when winter preparations begin, the sticky juice from an edil fruit is commonly spread along window frames, which are then stuffed with cloth to seal the windows off from drafts. As such, in just a little while, the number of fruits available at the town market is going to start decreasing, and the price is probably going to start going up, too. So, since it seems like we won’t be able to use edil fruit, we’re going to need to use slamo bug juice.\n\n\n Also, when it came time to go shopping for edil fruit, I was once again laid out with a fever, so Lutz went to meet Mark by himself. I heard from Lutz that he was finally able to get some valuable experience from working with Mark, so I briefly wondered if I’ve been butting in a little too much.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n By the time all of our raw ingredients have been collected, my health has recovered, and we are finally able to start working on making the paper itself, a month and a half has passed since our very first meeting with Benno.\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. The original measurement is given as “6 tatami mats”. Tatami mats are a kind of woven floor, built to standardized panel sizes, and rooms are generally sized by the number of panels you could fit into the room. A standard layout for a 6-tatami room is about 2.75 x 3.65 meters; I’ve rounded to the nearest half-meter to preserve the roughness of the measurement."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Today, we can finally start making paper. I’m raring to go, excited to the point where Lutz might tell me that I need to back it off a bit.\n\n\n Today’s tasks include finding and cutting down wood from trees that we think might work, based on what we were told at the lumberyard and what Lutz learned after asking various people he knew. Then, I’m thinking that we’ll set up next to the river and steam the wood, then submerge it in the river and strip the rough outer bark from it. We can then leave that bark in the warehouse to let it dry out.\n\n\n Since our prototype is only going to need to be postcard-sized, I don’t think we need very much raw wood to use as materials. However, since we’ll need to steam it for several hours, we’ll need to gather a lot of wood to use as fuel. If we’re working in the forest, gathering that much firewood shouldn’t be particularly difficult, and if we start to run out we can always go and find more. Lutz, though, seems to be having a hard time lugging both the pot and the steamer.\n\n\n In order to do this, he had to go out early in the morning to get the key to the warehouse, then go back to retrieve the pot and the steamer. Since we’ll have more work to do in the warehouse afterwords, he also let Mark know that we’d be keeping the key for the day. All of this preliminary work went flawlessly, but right now, things are unexpectedly difficult.\n\n\n “Lutz, are you okay?” I ask.\n\n\n “…Yeah,” he says.\n\n\n Although he says, that, he does not look at all okay as he trudges forward, the pot and steamer tied securely to his back. It looks like he’s about to give out any second now.\n\n\n The cause is simple. When we looked at the pot, he judged that it was a weight he’d have no problem carrying, and he did the same when we finished the steamer. “Yeah, I can carry this much,” he said. However, he didn’t actually think about what it would be like to carry both of them simultaneously all the way to the forest.\n\n\n “Can I carry the steamer, maybe?”\n\n\n “No, it’s too much for you.”\n\n\n “…Okay.”\n\n\n If Lutz says it’s too much for me, then it’s probably too much for me. All I can do right now is cheer Lutz on while I make sure to get to the forest without overdoing it.\n\n\n As always, a number of other children are walking with us as we all head to the forest together.\n\n\n “Lutz, whatcha got there?”\n\n\n “What’re you doing in the forest today?”\n\n\n Since Lutz is carrying both a pot and a never-before-seen steamer, the other children are very curious.\n\n\n “A pot and a steamer,” he says, tersely. “Making paper.”\n\n\n The stuff he’s carrying must be very heavy for him to be so taciturn. The children, though, are so full of curiosity that the pay no attention to his mood and keep peppering him with questions.\n\n\n “Huh? What are you making?”\n\n\n “Is it something fun?”\n\n\n “…No,” he replies. “I have to do this if I want to get my apprenticeship, they’re seeing if I can do it or not.”\n\n\n “Oh, okay! Got it. Good luck, Lutz!”\n\n\n I thought the questions were going to be endless, but as soon as they heard that it was something Lutz needed to do to secure his apprenticeship, they immediately started drifting away.\n\n\n I have no idea why the kids left us alone so quickly, so I ask Lutz about it. He says that even though a lot of kids get their apprenticeships through their parents, a lot of the more popular professions can get a flood of applications. In those cases, some parents will change tack, but it looks like there’s also some apprenticeships that have selection tests.\n\n\n It seems that other children are absolutely forbidden from interfering in these tests. There’s probably cases where some kids mess with others out of revenge, but if word of that were to get out then it would make their own job search even harder.\n\n\n Oh ho, I see. Trying to get into a popular job is the same, no matter where you go.\n\n\n When we pass by the gate, Otto waves at us encouragingly. “Good luck!” he says. He probably noticed the pot and steamer on Lutz’s back and figured out that we’re getting started making paper.\n\n\n “Yeah, we’ll do our best! Oh, Daddy! We’re heading out,” I say, waving at him.\n\n\n My father has been sulking a bit lately since I’ve been spending so much time with Lutz lately, but he still waves back at us, wearing a complicated expression that flickers somewhere between smiling and sullen. He’s not happy that I’m on such good terms with both Otto and Lutz, but I know very well that, with his particular mentality, there’s no way he wouldn’t be happy when his daughter waves cheerfully at him.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Whooof. I’m tired~. That was way heavier than I thought.”\n\n\n Lutz rolls his shoulders, having set the pot and steamer on the ground near the riverbank.\n\n\n “Good work, Lutz. Want to take a break for a little?”\n\n\n “Nah, steaming’s going to take about a bell’s time once we start, right? I’ll rest then.”\n\n\n Even as he’s saying that, he’s already starting to pile up rocks in a circle, building a makeshift stove that we can set the pot on top of.\n\n\n That’s Lutz for you. Nothing’s too impossible for him.\n\n\n Compared to Lutz, who’s so used to outdoor work, my previous life was all about indoor work, so I don’t have very much experience with this at all. Not being very useful, though, is basically my natural state. All I can do right now is gather up wood from the nearby area and hand it over to Lutz. He fills the pot up with water from the river, sets it on top of the stove, then quickly piles up wood underneath it and gets a fire going.\n\n\n “I’ll head off and start cutting down some wood, so how about you take a break and watch the fire for a while?”\n\n\n “Aren’t you the one that needs a break?!”\n\n\n “Well, if your health gets worse before we can make paper, I’ll really be in trouble. You’ll probably be fine gathering more wood around here, but don’t move around too much. Also, if anything happens, give a shout. Got it?”\n\n\n “…Alright.”\n\n\n Like Lutz asked, I quietly stay near the fire, keeping watch over it. Although, it looks like it’s going to be quite a long time before it actually starts boiling, so I’ve got some spare time. I gather up more fallen wood from around the area, bring it back to the firepit, and feed it into the fire.\n\n\n When I’ve collected all the wood from the immediate area, I head a little bit further into the forest looking for more. As I reach down to pick up a stick, I see something half-buried in the dirt. It looks like a large red berry, kind of like a pomegranate.\n\n\n “Huh? What’s that?” I wonder aloud. “Is it edible? Or maybe can I press oil out of it?”\n\n\n I’m convinced that most of the things in the forest are used in day-to-day life around here. After all, I’ve been living in this world for nearly a year now, so it’s only natural that I’d start thinking like it. When I was in Japan, I wouldn’t have done anything like arbitrarily gathering up whatever I see on the ground.\n\n\n “I’ll have to ask Lutz about this,” I muse.\n\n\n I grab a sturdy stick and start digging around the red berry, until I have it free of the ground. I reach down to pick it up, only to find it rapidly heating up in my hands.\n\n\n Oh no! This is probably some incomprehensibly weird fruit.\n\n\n Somehow, it seems like this red berry is another one of those really strange ingredients that I sometimes wind up using in my cooking. To be honest, I have literally no idea what’s about to happen, much less how to deal with it. Frantically, I summon all of my power, and throw it as far away from me as I possibly can… which means it lands about five meters away.\n\n\n Bang! Ba-ba-bang! The red berry bursts open violently, scattering everywhere. Suddenly, countless plants start sprouting from the ground. As I stare, dumbfounded, they quickly grow until they’re up to my ankles.\n\n\n What?! What the hell?! What are these pop-up trees?!1\n\n\n I frantically run away from this clearly abnormal situation, yelling at the top of my lungs.\n\n\n “Lutz! Lutz! Luuutz! Something weird’s happeniiiiiing!”\n\n\n “What’s wrong, Maine?!”\n\n\n Lutz comes crashing through the trees, probably from somewhere nearby. As soon as he sees what I’m pointing at, all the color drains from his face. He sticks his fingers in his mouth and lets out a piercing whistle.\n\n\n “Tronbay!” he yells.\n\n\n “What’s tro―” I start to ask, but he cuts me off.\n\n\n “I’ll explain later!”\n\n\n He immediately unsheathes his machete, chopping away at the rapidly-growing plants. By now, they’re up to his knees (and up to my thighs). It’s very clear that these fast-growing plants are actually extremely dangerous.\n\n\n “Head to the river, Maine! Got it?!”\n\n\n “G… got it!”\n\n\n There’s no spare time to chat in the middle of an emergency. I flee back towards the riverbank. The other children come running in from the other direction, summoned by Lutz’s whistle.\n\n\n “What’s u― whoa, tronbay?!”\n\n\n “It’s tronbay!”\n\n\n “Cut it down, now!”\n\n\n As always, I’m the only one who doesn’t know what’s going on. It looks like all the kids who came running already know what these pop-up trees are. Like Lutz, they all take out their knives and machetes as they head towards the plants.\n\n\n As the children run around, cutting down the pop-up trees, I sit by the pot and watch the reaping unfold. The foe is a plant, I think to myself, so couldn’t I just burn it down since I’ve got fire here? However, I’m already winded from that little bit of running I did, so I can’t really do anything but sit by the river like Lutz told me.\n\n\n “Any more still growing?” I hear.\n\n\n While I sat, worn-out, by the riverbank, the reaping of the pop-up trees seems to have drawn to a close. The children search about, making sure that there aren’t any that they’ve missed.\n\n\n “I think we’re alright now.”\n\n\n “There may be more tronbay around, so be pay attention out there when you’re working. If anything happens give a whistle.”\n\n\n The children disperse, going back to their gathering. Lutz comes over to stand next to me.\n\n\n “I told you to go sit by the river… was that too much?”\n\n\n “…Yeah, too much.”\n\n\n Lutz just finished chopping down a large number of plants, but I’m still the one who’s shamelessly gasping for every breath. If someone were to stumble across us like this, they definitely wouldn’t be able to guess who was on the front lines of that battle.\n\n\n “Lutz, what was, that?”\n\n\n “That was tronbay.”\n\n\n Tronbay, he says, are extremely fast-growing trees that, if you let them grow to adulthood, immediately suck up all the nutrients from the surrounding soil. Also, if you let them get too big, they become extremely difficult to cut down, to the point where you need to request the order of knights to send someone to deal with them.\n\n\n Huh, so there’s an order of knights here? As I’d expect of a fantasy world.\n\n\n “It’s weird, though.”\n\n\n “What is?”\n\n\n Lutz sits down on a rock on the riverbank, catching his breath, his head tilted to one side in puzzlement.\n\n\n “It’s kinda early for tronbay to show up. It’s usually much closer to autumn before you start seeing them.”\n\n\n “Huh…”\n\n\n “They also were growing really quickly. But the soil around them wasn’t really churned up…”\n\n\n “Hmm!”\n\n\n “What, you don’t think that’s weird?”\n\n\n Lutz stares at me, unimpressed by my lack of reaction. Asking me directly like that, though, puts me in a tight spot. This is the first time I’ve seen something like this, so I can’t tell if it’s weird or not. Trees popping up out of the ground like that is weird enough to me already.\n\n\n “Umm, I’ve never seen tronbay before, so I can’t tell if that was any different than usual.”\n\n\n “Ah, that’s right. You’ve only been coming to the forest since the spring.”\n\n\n He nods several times in understanding. As he does so, the pot starts audibly bubbling as the water comes to a boil.\n\n\n “Lutz, where’s the wood?”\n\n\n “It’s scattered somewhere around there, I think…”\n\n\n He points over to where the tronbay was growing, hanging his head. It looks like he’d found enough wood well before the pot came to a boil, but he threw away all his hard work when the tronbay suddenly appeared.\n\n\n “…Hey, Lutz. We’ve come all this way, so how about we try making paper out of tronbay? There’s a lot of it, and since it was cut down right after it started growing, its fibers are probably still very soft…”\n\n\n “Hey, you’re right. Going back to get the other stuff right now would be a huge pain.”\n\n\n We put the tronbay in the steamer, then Lutz sets it on top of the pot. All we need to do for a little while is just keep feeding the fire so it doesn’t go out. Lutz keeps an eye on the condition of the fire for a while, occasionally throwing in a few pieces of the firewood that I’d gathered earlier.\n\n\n “Maine, sorry, but could you watch the fire for a bit? I’m going to go gather up the wood I dropped.”\n\n\n “Okay,” I reply.\n\n\n He heads back out to where he’d been startled by the tronbay to go pick up the wood, perhaps because he’s had a bit of time to rest. I, in my new position as fire watchman, grab tightly to a stick, staring intently at the fire. By now, I’m actually able to regulate fires a little bit, but I’ve made too many inattentive mistakes getting to this point that I can’t take my eyes off of it now.\n\n\n Gas stoves really are convenient. At this point, induction grills and microwave ovens are practically magic. Seriously.\n\n\n As the tronbay steams, Lutz heads off to work on his gathering duties. It seems like there’s quite a lot of things to eat in the forest around the time summer turns to autumn. I gather some things as well, alternating between keeping an eye on the fire and picking up whatever catches my eye.\n\n\n “I found a lot of stuff, Lutz! What do you think?”\n\n\n “Lemme see, lemme see… …Maine! Pay attention! Actually look to see if you can bring something home before you pick it up.”\n\n\n As he looks over the pile of things I’d collected, the color drains from his face. He goes through the pile, pulling out everything that couldn’t be eaten. Over thirty percent of what I’d found was poison.\n\n\n “This one’s bad. If you eat it, your arms and legs will go all numb, and you won’t be able to move for three whole days. This is bad too. If you eat it, you’ll foam at the mouth and die. This too! It’ll make your stomach hurt terribly for two days. …Maine, if you don’t learn this stuff soon, you won’t have to worry about dying from sickness, because you’ll poison yourself to death! Got it?”\n\n\n Yep. And it’s not just me who’ll die if I don’t remember this, it’ll be my family, too.\n\n\n I need to immediately start memorizing not just the things that are useful in everyday life, but also how to distinguish which things out here are poisonous. I don’t have anything like an illustrated field guide, either, so I have no way to do this other than have it shown to me in person.\n\n\n “I’ll try hard to remember, so please teach me about it,” I say.\n\n\n “Yeah.”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Faintly, the sound of the city’s bell rings through the air, and we take the steamer off the pot. A burst of steam hits us in the face as we open it up, but just from taking a look at it I actually can’t tell if it’s had enough time to steam.\n\n\n “Is this okay?” asks Lutz.\n\n\n “I don’t really know, but let’s put it in the river and peel off the bark.”\n\n\n We dunk the wood in the river, then try to strip off the bark while the wood is still warm. It comes off cleanly, without crumbling or snapping at all. This is far easier than I thought it was going to be. We might have found an excellent material after all.\n\n\n “This tronbay might be really good for making paper,” I say.\n\n\n “We don’t know when it’ll grow, though, and we have to cut it down when it’s really young, right?”\n\n\n “…Whoa, this isn’t going to work, then.”\n\n\n I sigh, thinking back on how things unfolded today. If we could cultivate this, it would be an amazing material, but, alas.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine. Is this all we need to do today?”\n\n\n “Yeah. Next we need to let the bark dry out completely.”\n\n\n “…Hmmm. Alright, I’ll go wash up the pot, so take care of these, okay?”\n\n\n Lutz leaves me with tidying up the pile of bark as he goes to clean up the pot and the steamer. Sitting there and lining all of the strips in a row is remarkably fun, so I’m in good spirits as I pick away at the pile.\n\n\n As we return home, I carry several strips of the bark we harvested in the basket on my back. Lutz carries the pot and steamer, putting his entire soul into lugging it along. Since he’s also carrying the things we gathered today, his burden is definitely way heavier than it was when we had first gone out.\n\n\n Both Lutz and I are barely still on our feet as we make it back to town and split off from the rest of the group to head to the warehouse. When we get there, Lutz unlocks the door, steps inside, and drops everything to the ground.\n\n\n “Aaargh, that was heavy!”\n\n\n “You had a lot more stuff coming back than you did before, after all. You know, I could probably have carried a little more…”\n\n\n What I’d carried back already took all of my effort. I didn’t really have any extra surplus of energy to help him out. Lutz sits down in the corner and takes out a fistful of bark strips from the pot.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine,” he says, waving them around, “how and where are we going to dry these things?”\n\n\n “Eh? Ummm… how, huh?”\n\n\n I’d been thinking that we’d dry it out kinda like you dry out hay, but we don’t have any poles to do that from. I look around the room, searching for something to use.\n\n\n “Lutz,” I say, putting a hand on his shoulder, “I know your tired, but could you hammer a bunch of nails at even distances into these shelves, please? I’ll dry the bark on that.”\n\n\n “…If I have to…”\n\n\n Lutz hammers nails into the board, his hammer ringing, and I hang strips of bark from them. This is doable for now, since we don’t have very many of them, but when we move on to mass production, we’ll need a dedicated place for drying.\n\n\n When we get to the point where we start mass production, I’ll ask Benno about it. We don’t need to worry about that right now, right?\n\n\n “It would be pretty bad if these couldn’t dry completely here. If they’re damp for too long they’ll start getting moldy. Tomorrow, when we go to the forest, maybe we should take these along and dry them in the sun?”\n\n\n “So, could we just bring the bark with us tomorrow and keep the work pretty light? I want to gather some normal things. There’s a lot of things I need to get for my family, so I’d really appreciate it.”\n\n\n “Yeah, I want to gather a lot of mushrooms too so that I can try drying them out. I want to try making soup stock out of them.”\n\n\n “…Maine, get better at picking out the poison ones first.”\n\n\n The next day, we bring the bark with us. I hang the strips off the rim of my basket, then collect quite a large number of mushrooms.\n\n\n About twenty percent of them were poisonous.\n\n\n That’s weird, I didn’t expect that…\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Over the next few days, we let the bark dry out in the sun until it was completely dry. I don’t actually know how to tell when it’s “completely dry”, so I let it dry until I started wondering if I was maybe overdoing it. With the hard, dry bark strips in hand, we head back out to the forest. Our next step now is to let them soak in the river for a full day, so the weather is actually important.\n\n\n We pick a spot in the river that wouldn’t really stand out to anyone looking for it, then arrange some rocks in a circle and place the bark inside.\n\n\n “Will this work?” asks Lutz.\n\n\n “…Probably. Let’s check on it on our way back home.”\n\n\n I don’t have much practical experience, so I’m not very confident, but I’m pretty sure this is probably going to work. While I think about it, I look down at my feet, immersed in the river water.\n\n\n …It should be obvious, but I don’t have any rubber boots or gloves.\n\n\n Today, the weather is still fairly warm, so the water is merely cool, but as the seasons progress, the river might start getting life-threateningly cold.\n\n\n “Lutz, before it gets too cold, we need to get all of the wood to this point, not just the tronbay. At some point we won’t be able to go in the river anymore.”\n\n\n “…You’re right. The river’s pretty cold already, too.”\n\n\n Perhaps he’d been thinking about what was going to happen when the weather got cold too, because he frowns, nodding in agreement to my suggestion.\n\n\n “Today let’s cut down some wood, and hide it somewhere like we did with the clay. Tomorrow if we bring the pot and the steamer, shouldn’t we have some wood ready to go?”\n\n\n “Yeah, you’re right.”\n\n\n We spend some time searching for suitable wood, collecting a variety of different kinds and stashing them underneath a bush. While we do our gathering, I occasionally stop by the river to check on the state of the bark. They’ve been drifting around within the enclosure of the rocks, but they don’t look like they’re in any danger of being washed away. They’ve also started to swell up a bit from being immersed in the water.\n\n\n “I’ll be kinda worried while we’re away from the forest, but I think it’ll be okay,” says Lutz.\n\n\n “…Yeah.”\n\n\n With great reluctance, I head home, but even then I can’t help but worry about what’s happening to the bark. What if it suddenly starts raining super hard upstream, causing the water to surge and wash everything away? What if bandits come, see that there’s floating treasure, and steal it? Increasingly strange thoughts bounce unceasingly around my head as I stare blankly at the wall.\n\n\n The next day, I’m fidgeting constantly as we walk back towards the forest, but when we arrive I see that neither has a flash flood washed everything away nor have bandits stolen it, so they’re right there where we left them.\n\n\n “Oh, phew, they didn’t disappear.”\n\n\n “…So,” says Lutz, “now what do we do?”\n\n\n Lutz picks up a soggy, floppy strip of bark and looks at it dubiously.\n\n\n “We’ll use our knives to strip off this outer part, leaving only the white inner part of it. Although, let’s start steaming the wood we got yesterday first. We can work on this while the wood’s steaming.”\n\n\n “Got it.”\n\n\n The stone stove we made last time is still there, so after we do a little bit of maintenance we set the pot and the steamer back on it again. With that complete, we find a large, flat rock near the riverbank, close enough that we can keep the an eye on the pot, and start working on peeling off the outer bark.\n\n\n “Looks like we can leave the bark we want to dry here for now. Let’s try to get all of the white bark finished while the weather’s still warm out.”\n\n\n “Right!”\n\n\n Skrnk, skrnk, skrnk…… Screeeeeeeeeeeek……\n\n\n We place the bark on top of the stone, then start stripping the dark outer bark away so that we can keep only the lighter inner bark. It’s kind of like slicing off the high-quality breast meat from a chicken. The bark isn’t quite as tough as that, though, so we have to use short, halting strokes. There’s probably better tools and better methods for doing this, but right now, I need to make the best of what I’ve got.\n\n\n Skrnk, skrnk, skrnk…… Screeeeeeeeeeeek……\n\n\n “Hey, Maine. This, um… well, it’s not like I can’t do it, but…”\n\n\n “Yeah, we need a table for this.”\n\n\n The sound of our knives scraping against the stone shoots through my body, leaving me with unceasing goosebumps. I very, very much want some sort of cutting board to do this kind of work on.\n\n\n Thinking back on the list of tools that I’d written down, I really did wind up missing a lot of necessary things. I thought I’d had a good grasp on it, but there’s a lot of things I didn’t know about at all. As we work, it looks like we’re going to need to gradually supplement our supplies with more things that we need.\n\n\n With tears in my eyes, I continue peeling away at the bark, my goosebumps serving as a keen reminder of how important experience actually is.\n\n\n Notes:\n\n\n 1. There’s a pun here that doesn’t have a particularly good translation. Urano describes the plants as “にょきにょっ木” (nyoki-nyokki). “にょきにょき” (nyoki-nyoki) is an onomatopoetic expression that describes tall, thin things popping up everywhere, one by one, and “木” (ki) means tree. She’s swapping the last syllable of the first expression with the word for tree to describe trees that pop up everywhere."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Today, we brought with us our pot and some ash. As the dark outer bark of the other wood we’re experimenting with dries in the sun, we’ll boil the light inner bark from the tronbay together with the ash for about a bell’s worth of time. Lutz is much lighter on his feet today, perhaps because just the pot and the amount of ash we’ll be needing today aren’t all that heavy for him.\n\n\n After we walk to the riverbank, I set down the basket I was carrying on my back, then hang strips of bark from its edges to dry. While I do so, Lutz starts preparing the pot. He fills it with water, sets it on top of our stone stove, then starts heading off to find firewood.\n\n\n “Listen up, Maine. Do not, under any circumstance, leave this pot.”\n\n\n “I get it already!”\n\n\n The pot and the ashes are both very important and very difficult to acquire, so they’re worth quite a lot of money. On top of that, we’ll be in big trouble if the bark we’ve processed so far gets stolen as well. So, even someone as useless as me can come in handy once in a while, watching the stuff.\n\n\n I’ve been putting more effort into gathering lately, wandering around more and more, so Lutz has been incessantly hammering in his point.\n\n\n “You say that you get it, but every time you see something interesting, you immediately stagger off to look at it!”\n\n\n “I’ll stay right here until you get back, so just go already!”\n\n\n When I first started coming to the forest, I used to set down my basket as soon as I arrived, because it was so heavy. Whenever I tried leaving it behind as I went deeper into the forest, though, Lutz and Tory would get amazingly angry at me. Unlike in Japan, it seems like in this world you’d never, ever wander off and leave any of your things unattended. For this reason, all the kids who go to the forest always have their baskets and boxes worn on their backs, and they don’t ever gather more than they can carry.\n\n\n Lutz very quickly comes back with wood, which he uses to build a fire, then immediately takes off to get more for later. I periodically adjust the position of the basket as the daylight shifts, moving it out of the shadows in order to maximize the amount of drying time the outer bark gets, all while still keeping an eye on the pot.\n\n\n “Is it boiling yet?”\n\n\n “Yeah, just about, I think.”\n\n\n To the bubbling pot, I add the strips of inner bark and the ash, then realize that I need something to stir the pot with. However, we don’t have anything like that prepared.\n\n\n Nooo… yet another thing I didn’t think we’d need.\n\n\n I slump down dejectedly, suddenly aware of just how lacking my imagination is, then start looking around for something we might be able to use.\n\n\n “Lutz, could you please make me a couple of long straight sticks, about the same length, that I could use to stir the pot? I think wood would peel apart and get mixed in, so it would be great if you could use bamboo. There’s probably some nearby, right?”\n\n\n “Sticks made out of bamboo? Got it.”\n\n\n Lutz skillfully cuts a length of bamboo and whittles it into two long cooking chopsticks for me. Using those, I start stirring the pot. As I marvel at how much better he’s gotten at carving bamboo, maybe from when he made all those bamboo strips, Lutz murmurs something to himself.\n\n\n “…You’re really great at stirring things with those, huh.”\n\n\n “Um?! Y-y-yes! They’re super handy, aren’t they?”\n\n\n I force a smile onto my face, covering my sudden panic, as a cold sweat runs down my spine. This world doesn’t have Asian cooking, so of course it doesn’t have any chopsticks, so of course it wouldn’t have any people in it who are able to use chopsticks. There probably doesn’t exist a single normal little girl on this planet who would look at a pot that needs to be stirred, ask someone to make some chopsticks for her, wield them both in one hand correctly, then stir away like it’s the most normal thing in the world.\n\n\n Whoa, Lutz has a kind of doubtful expression on his face. It must be just my imagination. Just my imagination. Just my imagination, right?\n\n\n I continue stirring the pot, internally second-guessing every single movement. It would be very suspicious of me to suddenly change my grip and grab them like normal sticks right after he pointed it out. I have to keep using them like this for now, but my heart is pounding in my ears.\n\n\n Aaaaaahhh, I’m such an idiot! This totally isn’t just me thinking I’m looking suspicious!\n\n\n I try to keep my face as normal as I can as I continue stirring the boiling bark. After a while, I hear the faint chiming of the town bell, signaling that it’s probably about time to move on.\n\n\n We put the stewed bark in the river, simultaneously washing out the ash and exposing it to the sunlight. The more it’s exposed to the sun, the lighter it should be bleached. I don’t know exactly how the plants of this world behave, though, so I’m having to make assumptions based on what I remember from Earth.\n\n\n “Now we leave it like this for another day,” I say.\n\n\n “Right. Got it,” says Lutz.\n\n\n To make sure our paper will be as white as we can get it, we’ll leave the bark in the river for another full day. After Lutz finishes washing up the pot, we take turns going out to do our gathering work.\n\n\n I manage to reduce the total percentage of poisonous mushrooms by a just a little bit. I’ll need to keep at it like this.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, our main paper-related task is just retrieving the bleached white bark from the river. Essentially, we’re just going about our gathering business as usual, then when we’re just about ready to head back we’ll stop by the river and collect the bark. To do that, instead of bringing the pot with us today we’ve borrowed a bucket from home, but that’s all we need for today.\n\n\n “Work’s going to be mostly at the warehouse starting tomorrow, after all,” I say.\n\n\n “Ah, okay. So, we have to make sure we get all of our gathering done today, then.”\n\n\n I wind up with a sizable amount of things, including edible mushrooms that Lutz helped me select, several nearly-ripe melia fruit that Lutz helped me pick, and some cran that I hope to boil down into jam. While we work, I sample a few things for myself. These fruit are far, far more sour than anything I used to eat in Japan, but since this world lacks sweet things so dearly, you could think of these as delicious.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, instead of going to the forest, we sit outside the well in front of our warehouse to work. Today, I hope to get through picking all the junk out of the fibers and combing them out, enough to make several sheets of paper.\n\n\n Picking the junk out of the fibers involves finding and removing any damaged or knotted sections of the wood, which will increase the quality and consistency of the finished paper. Since this is work that can be done sitting down, I’m in charge of that. While I pick through it, Lutz is peeling edil fruit, crushing it, and mixing the pulp with water to make a sticky binding agent.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine. This the kinda goop you were looking for?”\n\n\n “…Hmmm, I think so? Since it’s sticky, I think that’s good, but honestly I don’t know exactly what we need. Try thinking about what it’s going to be like when we’re mixing the fibers in with it.”\n\n\n After I’m done removing all of the junk from the fibers, we start pounding them out. Using a squared timber made of a hard, oak-like wood, we need smash away at the pile of bark until it’s as soft as cotton. In order to make the stick comfortable to hold, we whittle the corners off of one side of it, then wrap some cloth that we borrowed from home around that side. Then, Lutz starts pounding away at it. This is Lutz’s job. If I were to try it, given how little strength I have, all I’d do is get in the way.\n\n\n This time, since we’re just working on a prototype, we don’t really need very many fibers so this doesn’t take a tremendous amount of time, but when we’re looking to start increasing the quantity, it looks like this might be really tough.\n\n\n We put the beaten, softened fibers in the tub, add the binder, then add water a little bit at a time so that we can regulate the stickiness of the mixture. Ordinarily, the next step would involve using a kind of large comb called a mase to churn this all together. For now, though, since we’re working with such small quantities, I have Lutz make two more sets of cooking chopsticks, then I hold them together like I was about to use them to whip up a custard, and mix the fibers up that way.\n\n\n …If I remember right, when I made recycled paper out of an old milk carton that one time, the mixture felt kind of like this…\n\n\n Since I am nothing even remotely like a craftsman, I don’t have any real sense for regulating the mixture, so I try my best to recreate how I remember the paper slurry I worked with back then felt. Finally, I take that slurry and spread it onto the bamboo mat in the paper frame.\n\n\n “Aaah, finally, the part I actually know how to do!”\n\n\n When we made homemade paper in my home economics class, the process was simple: we took recycled milk cartons, boiled them, peeled off the shiny polyethylene coating, put them into an electric mixer, added laundry starch, spread it out over a screen, and let it dry. We’re at the stage now in making washi that my home economics experience actually applies to: spreading pulp out to dry.\n\n\n My time has finally come! Roar out, my practical experience!\n\n\n “You really know how to do this?” asks Lutz, looking at me with a very doubtful expression on his face as I quickly set up the paper frame.\n\n\n Well, certainly, there have been a lot of parts in this process that have been really vague, and there have been a lot of tools that I didn’t know we needed until we actually needed them, but all of those problems were because I lacked any actual practical experience.\n\n\n Although I’m a little bitter about how little confidence Lutz has in me, I still stand up straight, suck in my baby gut, and look him dead on.\n\n\n “Leave it to me!” I say, cheerfully. “I’ve done this part before.”\n\n\n “…When?” he says, frowning. “Where?”\n\n\n The sudden sharpness in his voice makes my heart freeze.\n\n\n “Guh?! …A, a, aaaaa, a maiden has her secrets!! Don’t pry!!”\n\n\n Aaaaaaaaaaagh! I’m an idiot! I’m such an idiot! What am I saying?! He’s staring now! He’s staring at me! Aaaaaagh! Did I just wreck everything for myself?!\n\n\n I try desperately to hide the screams of terror in my heart behind a pleasant smile as I transfer some of the pulp into the paper frame. My fingers tremble slightly as I work, but not so much that it can be seen. I scoop some pulp into the frame, then shake it around, letting it spread out over the surface of the mat.\n\n\n “Why’re you moving it like that?”\n\n\n “Oh, this? By shaking it around, you can make sure it spreads out evenly so the paper will be the same thickness for the whole sheet. After this, depending on the kind of paper and how thick we want it, we might repeat this step a few more times.”\n\n\n “Hmmm, you’ve done this before, so you know a lot about it, huh?”\n\n\n Lutz’s frigid stare drills into me, scrutinizing every tiny detail of my facial expression. No matter what I say, I don’t think I’ll be able to weasel my way through an answer to that remark. Instead, all I can do is keep quietly working, then abruptly change the subject.\n\n\n “Uh, um, Lutz. I was thinking that we should change up how many times we’re doing this step for each sheet so that we can test out different thicknesses for the paper, what do you think?”\n\n\n “…Yeah, sure.”\n\n\n Perhaps he thought something was up with my spontaneous topic switch, because his eyes grow even colder as he continuously glances between the work that I’m doing and the expression on my face. As he stares, I keep spreading pulp out over the frame.\n\n\n Aaaaaargh, I think I just wrecked myself on my own wreckage again…\n\n\n When enough pulp is evenly spread, I remove the bamboo mat from the paper frame, then transfer the sheet of filtered paper over to the paper bed.\n\n\n “When you’re transferring paper over to the bed, you don’t want there to be any space between the new sheet and any sheets that you’ve already made, so you need to be careful like this about where you put everything down, starting from the first one.”\n\n\n “Let me try.”\n\n\n Lutz sets the mat back into the frame, then starts spreading pulp out himself. Since we’re only making small, postcard-sized sheets, it doesn’t take much movement to spread the pulp evenly across the surface of the mat. We take turns making sheets, working mostly in silence. Although I’d tried to prepare enough white bark to make only a few sheets of paper, by the time we’re finished, we have a full ten, showing just how off my calculations really were.\n\n\n Well, making too much isn’t actually a bad thing.\n\n\n “We haven’t made very many sheets today, but no matter if we’re making a a lot or a little, we’ll take this one day’s worth of paper and leave it here on the paper bed for a whole day so the water can naturally run off it.”\n\n\n “Then what, after that?”\n\n\n “Then we slowly start adding weight on top so that we squeeze the rest of the water out of it. We’ll put the stone weight on top of it and leave it alone for a day. If we do that, all of the leftover stickiness from the binding agent should go away.”\n\n\n “Hmm…! You know your stuff. Have you maybe done this before?”\n\n\n Whoa, Lutz’s eyes are penetratingly harsh. I’ve been completely exposed, haven’t I. I’ve managed to wreck everything for myself now, haven’t I. I am a complete and utter idiot.\n\n\n However, since all he’s doing right now is staring at me with narrowed eyes, thinking deeply about something or other, there’s no way that I’m going to say anything else to finish myself off. I’ve done enough damage already, so since I don’t want to do any more I keep working, indifferently, as if I didn’t want to be wasting any time on idle chatter.\n\n\n If I tried to lie my way through this, I’d probably immediately mess up, and suddenly being perfectly honest with him is far too risky. I’m positive that he’ll say something once we manage to finish making paper, but I don’t know how much of this he’s figured out or what he’s actually going to say.\n\n\n I’ve already thought about how I’d deal with the situation, so there’s not really any problem there. I hate painful things, and I hate scary things. If anything like that looks like it’s going to happen, I’ll unleash the fever that I keep bottled up inside my body, let myself be swallowed by it, and disappear.\n\n\n Lately, I’ve been feeling like the fever is getting more powerful than it used to be, so I’m sure it won’t take very long for it to devour me once I let it out.\n\n\n Unfortunately, there’s one big new regret that has come into my life since the last time I thought about this. All that’s left on finishing this paper is letting it dry out. If we haven’t made any mistakes, I’ll finally have been able to make paper so, before I disappear, I want to make a book.\n\n\n I wonder if I can stall long enough to make a book?\n\n\n I want to buy myself some time. For now, until I can finish a book, I need to come up with some way to drag things out.\n\n\n As I contemplate what I could do, I continue jerkily going through the motions of my work.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, we don’t talk very much either. We walk to the forest, put the next round of dark outer bark into the river to soak, then do our gathering work. When we return to the town, we drop by the warehouse to put the stone weight on top of the paper bed, but since there isn’t a whole lot else to actually do, there really isn’t anything to keep me from constantly looking over to see how Lutz is doing. I’m very much aware that he, too, keeps glancing over to look at me.\n\n\n “Hey, uh…” he says.\n\n\n “Hm? What’s up?”\n\n\n A tremor runs uncontrollably through my body as Lutz speaks up. I’d planned to be calm and composed, like nothing was wrong at all, but I can’t make myself act like I thought I could. While I wait nervously for his next words, Lutz scratches furiously at his head, ruffling his blond hair. He opens his mouth as if to say something, then closes it again.\n\n\n “…Never mind.”\n\n\n “O… okay.”\n\n\n These are seeds that I have sown myself, so I’m well aware that there’s nothing more that I can do now, but as long as things continue like this, there’s no way I’ll ind any comfort.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, we go to the forest to work on stripping off the outer bark from our next set of materials, making sure not to forget to bring a board to work on this time. This time, the work is far, far more difficult than it was with the tronbay. The fibers are left in tatters as I pass my knife through them. This isn’t only due to my own incompetence, though, even Lutz seems to be having a hard time. Tronbay fibers worked so well, but the difficulty of working with this material makes me wonder if we even can make paper out of it.\n\n\n “…This material’s different, so it’s way harder, huh.”\n\n\n “Yeah, it really is.”\n\n\n I can’t help but let out a sigh as I compare the tattered fibers to our current relationship.\n\n\n “We can let the inner bark dry like it is, so let’s stop for now.”\n\n\n “Mm. Hey, uh…”\n\n\n “What’s up?”\n\n\n “…Nah, maybe later. I’ll tell you when we’ve made some paper.”\n\n\n Lutz closes his mouth and doesn’t say anything more, and I give him a small nod. Inside, I’ve already prepared myself for the worst. Lutz has noticed that I am not, in fact, Maine, and he’s going to blame me for it. After all, ever since that enormous mistake, he’s never called me “Maine” even once.\n\n\n When we finish making paper, I wonder just what kind of yelling I’m going to get? Or maybe is it going to be abuse? Thanks to my overactive imagination, the Lutz in my mind starts screaming worse and worse insults and abuse at me. In my imagination, my heart feels hollow, and I hang my head.\n\n\n How could you say all that, Lutz! You’re so mean! Even though you’re a figment of my imagination, you’re making me cry! I’m crying!\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, we work at the warehouse. First, we hang the inner bark we worked on along the edge of my basket so that it can dry in the sun, and set it outside. Next, we lift the stone weight from the paper bed, then carefully peel off each sheet of paper and stick them to another board.\n\n\n “We really should use a paintbrush or something to get all the air out from underneath these sheets, but I guess I forgot to order that too. Ah well, ah well. These are postcard-sized, so if we’re careful about it, it’ll probably work out.”\n\n\n “…Wow, you forget way too much stuff.”\n\n\n Lutz shoots me a brief glare, but thanks to all of the hideous abuse my imaginary Lutz has been constantly showering me with, something at this level doesn’t even faze me. I shrug my shoulders a bit, brushing off the insult.\n\n\n “Well, make sure you don’t forget anything either, next time we do this. …That aside, though, once we let these dry in the sun, they’ll be all done. The longer we let them stay in the sun, they brighter white they’ll get, too.”\n\n\n Lutz carries the board outside and leans it against a wall so that the sun can hit it. After that, he washes off the paper bed in with water from the well, then sets it next to the board with the paper on it so that it can dry as well.\n\n\n The bright gleam of the white paper lined up to dry under the perfectly clear, blue sky creates a beautiful contrast. I let out a sigh of satisfaction, wondering if this is the paper that I’ll be able to make into a book.\n\n\n “Haaah, it’s paper! It’s really turned into paper. …It’s really paper.”\n\n\n “Hey, so…”\n\n\n “Let’s let it dry until evening. When it’s dry, we’ll need to peel it off carefully so that it doesn’t rip, then it’ll be totally finished.”\n\n\n With the paper so close to being complete, I want to put off having to face Lutz just a little while longer. Perhaps he senses this in my expression, because irritation suddenly flashes across his face.\n\n\n “Hey, it’s basically done, right?”\n\n\n “…Well, yeah, but…”\n\n\n “I told you, right? When we’ve made some paper, I’ve got something I need to say to you.”\n\n\n The time of my reckoning is at hand. A sharp light glitters in Lutz’s green eyes, as if an anger deep inside him is clawing its way towards the surface.\n\n\n I bite my lip, hard, telling myself that I’ll stay standing no matter what he might say to me. Steeling myself, I turn to face Lutz dead on."

Without suddenly flying into a rage, he begins to speak in a low voice that hints at the anger he keeps contained, boiling in his gut.\n\n\n “…Who are you, really?”\n\n\n A difficult question right off the bat. I actually don’t quite know what to call myself. Even now, I still think of myself as Urano Motosu, but no matter how anyone looks at me, all they could possibly see is Maine. Also, I’ve been living in this body for nearly a year now, growing accustomed to life in this world, so I’m no longer really Urano Motosu, either.\n\n\n Urano only read books, and didn’t really do anything else of her own volition. When I went to college, I was commuting to and from home, so I never even moved out of my parents’ place. Thanks to the fact that my mother was fundamentally a housewife, I didn’t have to do much housework, although I was technically capable of doing it if I ever felt so inclined.\n\n\n Going to the forest every day like this to gather things for my family, devoting myself to finding new flavors so that I can broaden my diet even just a little, making paper from scratch so that I can read books in the future… none of these things are actually necessary. If you compare the me of right now to the Urano of the past, whose desires were limited to reading whatever book happened to be nearby, we’re absolutely different.\n\n\n As I worry over how exactly I should answer, Lutz takes my silence as a sign that I’m not going to answer at all. He glances at me again, strength flaring in his eyes, and asks me again.\n\n\n “You know how to make paper like this, and you said you’ve done this before, right?”\n\n\n “…It was very different the last time I made it.”\n\n\n “And that’s not Maine.”\n\n\n “…Yeah.”\n\n\n Although I still want to hide the truth, Lutz is already convinced of it. Even if I were to lie, nothing would come from it. I answer honestly.\n\n\n “Maine couldn’t know anything like that,” says Lutz. “She barely ever left her house.”\n\n\n From Maine’s memories, I know very well that Maine only rarely left her house. Thanks to that, I had almost no information about the world, and who knows how many problems that has caused me? Since Maine’s memories were of almost nothing but the inside of her house, I couldn’t even catch a glimpse of what this world would consider to be common sense, and my own modern common sense constantly clashes with that of this world. Even still, I think that I’m making a lot of mistakes.\n\n\n “That’s right,” I say. “Maine really didn’t know much of anything.”\n\n\n “So, who the hell are you?!” he shouts. “Where’s the real Maine?! Bring Maine back!”\n\n\n Lutz raises his voice, his anger unleashed. However, whether it’s because the things I had imagined him saying were far more cruel than the words he hurls at me now, or whether it’s because I’d already prepared myself for what was going to come when we’d finished making paper, I feel entirely calm right now. My reaction is vastly different from the panic I showed right after I wrecked myself earlier.\n\n\n “Sure, I can bring her back, but… I think it would be better if I did that at home, you know?”\n\n\n Lutz’s eyes go wide with astonishment, and he furrows his eyebrows. It seems he didn’t expect me to agree.\n\n\n “Why?”\n\n\n “Well, it would look really bad if you came home carrying a corpse over your shoulder, right? If I go away, all that’ll be left is a dead body, after all. It wouldn’t be good if people thought you were a murderer, right?”\n\n\n Lutz and I are the only two people who use this warehouse, and both our families and the people from Benno’s shop know that the two of us came here today. If I were to lose consciousness and die here, it’s extremely likely that all of the blame would be put on Lutz. Even if it wasn’t, Lutz himself would know of his own sin, I think.\n\n\n I, personally, was thinking of Lutz when I proposed that it would be better to do it at home, but Lutz acts as if this came entirely out of nowhere.\n\n\n “Y-y-you, w-w-w-what are you saying?!”\n\n\n Startled by my words, Lutz’s face goes completely stiff as he grows incredibly flustered. It seems that it was far beyond his expectations that Maine wouldn’t come back if I were to disappear.\n\n\n “S-so, Maine isn’t here anymore?! She’s not coming back?!”\n\n\n “Yeah, probably…”\n\n\n I can’t describe it as anything else but “probably”. All I’m able to do is search through Maine’s memories. I’ve never been able to talk to her, and she’s never spoken up to demand her body back.\n\n\n “Answer this!”\n\n\n Lutz fixes a powerful glare on me, the picture of an ally of justice facing down a hated evil. I can’t help but smile a little when I realize that. This is so perfectly like him. His frail childhood friend, who he treated like his own sister, has been hijacked by me, a foul villain, and he is leaping to her defense, like the hero he is.\n\n\n “What about that fever that Maine was talking about with Mister Otto and Master Benno? Did you make her fever eat her up?!”\n\n\n I’m a little impressed that Lutz put together that Maine had been swallowed whole by the fever that still lurks deep within me. I’m pretty sure he’s not wrong, at least not about that part.\n\n\n “You’re about half right and half wrong. I also think that Maine was eaten away by the fever. Her last memories are all \"it’s hot”, “help me”, “it hurts”, “make it stop”, that’s why. But I’m not the fever. It’s eating me alive too.“\n\n\n \"What are you saying?! Isn’t this your fault?! Didn’t Maine disappear because of you?! Say it!!”\n\n\n Lutz grabs tightly onto my shoulders and starts shaking me. My thoughts thrown into disarray by agitation, the words “it’s my fault,” and “Maine disappeared because of me” bounce around endlessly in my head. Then something snaps.\n\n\n “Like hell I actually wanted to come here and be Maine! I died, or at least I’m pretty sure I did, and then before I knew it I was this child. If I could have actually chosen where I was going to go, I’d pick a world with tons of books I could read, or maybe be an aristocrat in this world who could actually read, or even just a body that’s healthier than this feeble, pathetically weak one! There is no way that I would ever have voluntarily picked a body that is plagued by an incurable disease that constantly threatens to strike me down with fever at any moment!”\n\n\n The instant I so plainly say that I never wanted to become Maine, Lutz’s face goes slack and hollow, and his hands loosen from my shoulders.\n\n\n “You… didn’t want to become Maine?”\n\n\n “Would you, Lutz? In the beginning, just leaving the house left me out of breath, and I’d have to stay in bed the whole next day, you know? Even though I can finally make it out to the forest, I’m still growing so slowly, and even now if I make the slightest mistake my fever comes back…”\n\n\n Lutz thinks about it for a little while, slowly shaking his head. The energy he had when he’d grabbed me has all vanished, and his troubled eyes drift off to the side.\n\n\n “…You could be swallowed by the fever too?”\n\n\n “Yeah, I think so. If I loosen the grip I have on it, it immediately rushes back out, and I start feeling like I’m being devoured. It’s something like being swallowed, or maybe like being dissolved… it’s difficult to explain.”\n\n\n Lutz frowns as he mulls over my words. It seems like it’s also difficult to imagine, just from my explanation.\n\n\n “That’s why,” I say, “if you’re not happy with the fact that I’m using Maine’s body, and if you think you want me to disappear, just say it. I can disappear whenever you want.”\n\n\n Lutz, who just moments ago had been yelling at me to bring the real Maine back, stares at me with astonishment. His terrified expression is asking me what the hell I’m saying, which leaves me a little bewildered.\n\n\n “…It’s better if I disappear, right?”\n\n\n When I ask for confirmation, Lutz suddenly raises his eyebrows and starts shouting, as if he’s the one who should be angry at me, the victim.\n\n\n “Don’t ask me! Why are you asking me?! It’s really weird to say that you’ll disappear if I tell you to!”\n\n\n “It’s probably weird, yeah, but… if you weren’t here, I probably would have already disappeared a long time ago.”\n\n\n Lutz looks like he has no idea what I’m talking about. I start to explain what happened the last time I nearly disappeared, thinking back to how it all began.\n\n\n “Don’t you remember? When Mommy burned my mokkan, how I collapsed?”\n\n\n “Yeah…”\n\n\n With an “oh, that’s right, that happened, didn’t it” expression, Lutz nods. To him, that hadn’t been a big deal, but to me it was an enormous turning point in my life.\n\n\n “Back then, I was thinking I should just let my self be swallowed up. I really was planning to disappear. I didn’t have any lingering attachments to this world without books, and no matter how hard I tried I wasn’t ever able to finish anything, so I was thinking I might as well give up.”\n\n\n Lutz gulps nervously, so loudly I can hear it. He looks at me, silently urging me to continue, so I gently close my eyes and remember. As I was drowning in the heat, amidst the faces of my family dimly projected across my consciousness, Lutz’s face unexpectedly had risen to the surface.\n\n\n “When I was being swallowed by the fever, I could see my family’s faces, but then suddenly I saw your face, and I wondered why you were there too. I focused on that, and gathered up my strength to drag my consciousness back from the fever. When I saw you really were there, I was a little surprised, you know?”\n\n\n “That’s… you can’t seriously have come back because you were surprised that you saw me, and not a family member?”\n\n\n He frowns, sighing, and I gently shake my head at him.\n\n\n “What brought me back was that I was surprised to see you, but then you said that you were going to go get me some bamboo, so that my mother wouldn’t burn it? That made me think that I should hold on for a little bit longer, that I should fight back against the fever.”\n\n\n “Your mom burned the bamboo too, didn’t she?”\n\n\n I nod. I can still clearly recall the anger and chagrin that pierced through me, leaving me with that deep despondency. Even just remembering it makes me feel like the fever within me is growing more powerful.\n\n\n “If everything really is awful, and I don’t actually care about anything anymore, I was thinking, then the fever will just rush in and carry me away. I didn’t care enough to fight back anymore, so dying like that might have been a relief, but… then I remembered our promise.”\n\n\n “Our promise?”\n\n\n “I don’t remember a promise,” he mumbles to himself. He looks up and to the side, as if he really doesn’t remember and is having to dig through his memories. Of course. I smile a little to myself. To Lutz, all he had been trying to say was that I’d better get well soon. Even so, those words were the all-important lifeline to which I clung.\n\n\n “I promised I’d introduce you to Mister Otto. Didn’t you say that the bamboo was advance payment for the favor, so I had to get better?”\n\n\n Perhaps he remembered something that he didn’t want to, but when he hears me clearly identify him as the source of my last lingering attachment to this world, he groans in embarrassment, holding his head in his hands.\n\n\n “Th… that was! I wasn’t trying to make you feel like you owed me… aaargh, no!”\n\n\n “Then, what were you trying to say?”\n\n\n “Don’t ask! Nothing! Forget about it!”\n\n\n I want to play the straight man in to Lutz’s completely unforeseen reaction, but right now I’m supposed to be being blamed. As Lutz requests, I pretend that nothing’s happening.\n\n\n “Ummm, well, I remembered the promise like that, and then I also thought that I really shouldn’t disappear without returning at least one favor, after everything you did for me, so I worked hard to push the fever back, and, um…”\n\n\n “…”\n\n\n “So we met Mister Otto and Mister Benno, and I kept my promise, and then we made paper, so even though I want to make a book if I can, I think it’s okay if I disappear now, if you want me to?”\n\n\n Lutz looks at me with a face like he’s swallowed a bug. He looks me up and down, with eyes that wouldn’t miss even the slightest lie, then hangs his head limply.\n\n\n “Since when…”\n\n\n “Um, what?”\n\n\n I can’t hear anything he’s saying as he mumbles with his head hung low, so I tilt my head curiously to one side and ask him to repeat himself. Lutz raises his head and stares at me dead on.\n\n\n “Since when have you been Maine?”\n\n\n “…When do you think? When do you think that I wasn’t the Maine you knew anymore?”\n\n\n I may have answered his question with another question, but Lutz doesn’t get angry. Instead, he looks vacantly off into the sky, thinking deeply. He looks back down at me, mutters something too quietly for me to hear, then looks down at his feet, kicking at the dirt with his shoe.\n\n\n “…That,” he says, pointing at my hairpin. “Was it about when you started wearing that?”\n\n\n I didn’t expect him to guess quite so accurately, but it’s true, I’m the only one who wears my hair with a hairpin like this. If my hair weren’t so silky and straight, liable to come loose no matter how many times and how tightly I’d tie it, I’d probably be wearing it normally, tied back with a string.\n\n\n “…Correct.”\n\n\n “That’s basically a year ago!” he yells, with such force that spittle flies from his mouth. His eyes flare wide open with rage.\n\n\n Come to think of it, I became Maine at about the end of autumn. Right now it’s about halfway through the autumn, so soon the seasons will have come all the way around once.\n\n\n “Yeah, I guess that’s right. Most of what I remember is being stuck in bed with a fever, but it’s been about a year.”\n\n\n My memories of over half of the time I’ve been living in this world have been of being feverish and bedridden, but if you compare that to the Maine of before who spent the vast majority of her time stuck in bed, I’m remarkably energetic.\n\n\n “…Has your family noticed?”\n\n\n “I have no clue. I know they notice I’ve been doing some strange things, but I wonder if they really haven’t even considered that I’m not actually Maine?”\n\n\n I especially can’t think that Tory and my mother, who had to spend so much time looking after Maine while she was secluded in the house, haven’t noticed anything at all. However, they haven’t said anything about it, and I haven’t either. Living like that is very practical, so I think it’s more-or-less okay.\n\n\n “Also, Daddy said that he’s overjoyed just that his daughter is starting to get healthier.”\n\n\n “…I see.”\n\n\n Lutz lets out a long sigh, then turns his back on me as if to say the conversation is over. He runs a fingertip along one of the pages of paper clinging to the board, checking it to see how well it’s drying. I had been fully prepared to disappear, but when this conversation ended without a satisfying conclusion, I can’t help but be troubled about how my future is going to play out.\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz…”\n\n\n “…I think your family should decide, not me.”\n\n\n He interrupts me before I have a chance to finish. He’s saying that my family should be the ones to decide whether or not I should disappear. However, if that’s the case, then nothing will actually change for me right now.\n\n\n “So, should we keep going like this for now?”\n\n\n “Yeah, let’s do that.”\n\n\n I don’t know what Lutz is really thinking, since he’s not looking over here. Does he not particularly mind that I, who am not Maine, am going to continue living like this for the time being?\n\n\n “And that’s okay?”\n\n\n “Like I said, that’s not something I should be deciding…”\n\n\n Lutz stubbornly refuses to look at me, so I reach out and grab his arm. I want to ask him how he feels about me, since I’m not Maine. But, if I avoid such a troubling topic of conversation and just maintain the status quo, I wonder if he’d be alright with that?\n\n\n “Lutz, is it really okay if I don’t disappear? I’m not the real Maine, you know?”\n\n\n Lutz’s arm twitches a little bit. I thought for a moment that his arm was trembling a little bit in my grip, but it was really my hand that was trembling.\n\n\n “…It’s fine.”\n\n\n “Why?”\n\n\n As I ask him again, he finally turns around to look at me. With an expression somewhere between shock and amazement, he reaches up and flicks me on the forehead.\n\n\n “If you disappear, Maine’s not coming back, right? Also, if you’ve been here for an entire year already, then you’re basically the Maine I know.”\n\n\n He roughly scratches at his head as he speaks, messing up his golden hair. Then, he looks me firmly in the eyes. What I see reflected in the pale green of his eyes is calmness, the anger and threatening attitude from the beginning evaporating away. These are the eyes of the Lutz I’ve always known.\n\n\n Because before, I hadn’t thought about exercising my body, so I was even weaker. Because if I counted the number of times I’ve actually come face-to-face with Lutz or Ralph, I wouldn’t need more than my two hands.\n\n\n “…That’s why, it’s okay if you’re my Maine.”\n\n\n When Lutz says that, something deep in my heart clicks into place. Something that had been fluttering about within me settles down with a thump. It really wasn’t a big change, so small that you couldn’t see it if you looked, but for me, it was the biggest, most important change in the world."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Aaaaaargh, it’s ripping apart…”\n\n\n “This one, too.”\n\n\n The prototype paper we made out of tronbay worked out well, but batches we’ve been making to test other kinds of materials have not. I don’t know if it’s because the fibers aren’t adhesive enough, or if they’re too short, but they aren’t tangling together very well, nor are they sticking together, so as the sheets dry out they start falling to pieces.\n\n\n “I wonder if it would work better if we add more binding agent…? What do you think?”\n\n\n “I think we’ve got no choice but to try whatever we can think of, one after the other.”\n\n\n In order to make the fibers stick together more easily, we try adding more binding agent, and in order to make the paper less likely to tear, we try making it a little bit thicker.\n\n\n “How about this?” I ask.\n\n\n “I have no clue about how it’ll turn out when it’s dry, but it’s coming together pretty well, I guess.”\n\n\n The thicker, gluier paper dries rock hard, and when we try to peel it from the board it snaps in half. We stare, dumbfounded, at the fragments as they drop, one by one, to the ground.\n\n\n “…That’s a failure, huh.”\n\n\n “Yeah, this one didn’t tear, it… broke? It wasn’t actually paper, at least.”\n\n\n I don’t know if the problem is with the ratio of fiber to binder to water, or if the raw materials themselves aren’t right for the job. At one point, I’d read something about what kinds of vegetation could be made into paper, but in this world that sort of knowledge doesn’t really apply. The failures have been accumulating, to the point where I want to scream, “how did this happen?!”\n\n\n “This is just making me wish we could mass produce tronbay paper.”\n\n\n “There’s no way!”\n\n\n “Couldn’t we make something work as long as we had tronbay seeds?”\n\n\n I think that, as long as we had some of those red fruit, harvesting enough tronbay would be easy enough, but Lutz shakes his head vigorously when I suggest it.\n\n\n “Don’t search for them! Do you want to destroy the forest?!”\n\n\n “If we found a seed, couldn’t we get everyone to quickly cut it all down as soon as it grew?”\n\n\n I’m a not quite sure about this because I don’t know when tronbay actually grows, but when someone finds a seed they could gather a bunch of people to wait for it to sprout, then as soon as it does they could jump in and deal with it. However, Lutz rubs his forehead, insisting that it’s not a good idea.\n\n\n “You have no idea when tronbay will grow! It’s too dangerous!”\n\n\n “Ah, I see.”\n\n\n It seems like I had stumbled across a tronbay seed that was coincidentally right on the verge of sprouting, but it turns out that tronbay don’t usually sprout immediately after you pick them up. Lutz is starting to get a little angry, so I decide to give up on using these mysterious pop-up trees.\n\n\n “…Please learn how things work around here.”\n\n\n “I’m trying, though!”\n\n\n Since Urano’s memories from my previous life are crammed into my head far more firmly than those of Maine, who rarely left her house, no matter what the situation the raw evaluation criteria I wind up using is still always Urano’s. However, because Lutz and I have been discussing some of Maine’s memories, I’ve gradually started thinking of them a little more, and Lutz has been helping to correct my actions, too.\n\n\n “Anyhow, using tronbay is dangerous. When tronbay starts sprouting, it drains all the strength from the soil, so for a while after it sprouts nothing else can grow there. We can’t mass-produce it.”\n\n\n “Whaaat?! It’s that dangerous?! But nothing like that happened last time, right?”\n\n\n “Didn’t I say that was weird? Did you not hear me or something?”\n\n\n “I don’t know anything about normal tronbay, so I had no idea if anything about that was weird or not.”\n\n\n Tronbay has been the best material so far, but since it’s such a dangerous plant, and since it only grows in the autumn, mass producing it would be impossible. Rather than wishing for something that doesn’t exist, it’s much more useful to be thinking about if there’s something we can find that actually exists. So, we had no choice but to keep searching through trial and error.\n\n\n While we were doing that, we had to consider whether any of the wood that we can easily find in the forest is actually something that’s mass-producible. Also, we needed to think about the ratios of materials, try crushing the fibers more or less, using sulamo bugs instead of edil fruit for the binding agent, and so on, in order to try to make gradual improvements in the final product.\n\n\n “Out of these, forin seems to be the best for this.”\n\n\n “Yeah. If we add just a little bit more sulamo glue to the forin, it looks like we get something good enough to sell.”\n\n\n When we tested the three soft woods that the lumberyard recommended to us, we found that forin was able to make the thinnest paper. Forin fibers, compared to those of the other two varieties, are a little stronger. This makes them harder to beat into shape, but the more we beat it, the more stickiness is released from the fibers. Once we discovered that, we were able to make a comparatively good paper by beating the fibers thoroughly. Then, when formulating the pulp, we tested gradual changes to the ratios of the various ingredients that we used until we found the best proportions we could.\n\n\n I write down the proper ratios on my slate, then clap my hands together to shake the dust from them.\n\n\n “I think we’ve got it now, right?” I ask.\n\n\n “Yeah, if we make it like this, it looks like we can mass-produce it.”\n\n\n Lutz’s face is bright now that we’ve found the proper ratios. I happily run a fingertip along the surface of our completed paper.\n\n\n “Mass production is going to have to start in the spring, though. Getting more wood right now is going to be a huge pain, and bark in the winter is going to start getting tougher and tougher.”\n\n\n “Yeah, you’re right.”\n\n\n We’d make much better paper if we waited until spring arrived and the plants came to life again, then went to collect young trees and new branches. Besides, the weather is already such that bleaching the bark in the river is already a very painful process. I want to wait for it to get warm for Lutz’s sake, too.\n\n\n “So, let’s get our finished paper over to Mister Benno as soon as possible. I’m going to have to start helping Mister Otto at the gate for the winter, after all.”\n\n\n “Yeah. In a little bit we’re going to have to start preparing for the winter, so we should get this finished as fast as we can.”\n\n\n “Right. Tomorrow I’ll go to the gate and ask Mister Otto about how to write a thank-you note. We were finally able to make paper! I want to show him my thanks.”\n\n\n Lutz nods his agreement to my suggestion, as he starts gathering up the remains of today’s failed experiment.\n\n\n “I’ll leave the thank you note to you, then. So, you’re going to be bringing today’s failed paper home with you?”\n\n\n “Yeah. We’ll take the successful paper to Mister Benno, but I can use the botched paper, even if it has some holes or is peeling a little bit, to make a book.”\n\n\n I’ve already confirmed with Mark that it’s okay for me to bring home the large quantity of failed experiments. With this, I can finally start working on making a book\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, I return to the gate; my first time in a while. As winter accounting season comes around, all the necessary documents for processing the calculations have been gradually piling up, so Otto’s face is positively radiant when he greets me.\n\n\n “Hey there, Maine! I’ve been waiting.”\n\n\n He pats the accumulated pile of wooden cards sitting next to him, smiling brilliantly as he beckons to me. The cards are covered with totals of goods and quantities, and it looks like Otto is in the middle of writing everything out into the official documents.\n\n\n As I help him out with that, I eventually try asking him about how to write a thank-you note.\n\n\n “Mister Otto, if you could, I’d appreciate it if you could show me how to write a thank-you note.”\n\n\n “A thank-you note? Like what the noblemen exchange?”\n\n\n Well, no, it doesn’t have to be like what a noble does, I almost start to stay, but I stop myself. Perhaps it really is a custom that only noblemen practice.\n\n\n “Umm, I figured that since there are letters of introduction, then maybe there was a letter of thanks from the people who got introduced… was I wrong?”\n\n\n “Well, I know that noblemen exchange those among each other, but it’s not something that merchants explicitly write. It’s a waste of paper to use it on something that’s not a contract.”\n\n\n Of course, paper is such an expensive commodity that they wouldn’t use it so lightly.\n\n\n “Then, how should they send thanks?”\n\n\n “For a trader, you usually give the other party something from what you trade in that they might find useful. It doesn’t really matter if you have an attendant deliver it or if you deliver it yourself, but you don’t send a thank-you note, you send a gift.”\n\n\n I thought that there was going to be a general format for a thank you note, like there’s one for a letter of introduction, and that I could write one on a sheet of our finished paper, but he’s telling me that it’s normal not to send a note, but instead to give a gift.\n\n\n “…Whoa, I didn’t expect that. Hey, Mister Otto. What do you think I should give to Mister Benno? I can’t think of anything that Lutz or I could possibly send to him that he would want.”\n\n\n I really can’t think of anything that I personally have that Benno might possibly be interested. Benno seems to be a man who has everything.\n\n\n Otto shrugs his shoulders, then gives me some advice.\n\n\n “Wouldn’t the paper the two of you’ve made be a good gift? That’s all you two trade in right? If it has value as a commodity, then showing Benno that his initial investment is paying off would be the best. Besides that… maybe information on some kind of new product… or something like that, I think.”\n\n\n “I understand. Thank you very much, Mister Otto.”\n\n\n Something to increase the value of the paper, or information about a new kind of good, huh… I might be able to come up with something like that.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, I immediately rush to Lutz to propose to him my idea for the paper we should make to show Benno our thanks.\n\n\n “It turns out that merchants don’t say thanks by sending thank you notes. They give each other something that they think they’d like. So, I think we should make some special paper out of tronbay for him. We still have some tronbay inner bark, right?”\n\n\n “Yeah. We should give Master Benno the best paper we can, shouldn’t we? …Hey, Maine, what’ve you got there? Leglas?”\n\n\n He looks down at the red leaves I brought with me.\n\n\n “Oh, is that what it’s called? I found it growing next to the well, so I picked some yesterday. I want to try doing something like pressing flowers, I think.”\n\n\n “What are you going to do with those?”\n\n\n “I’m going to use them to make paper, of course!”\n\n\n Leglas is a plant that looks like a red clover. I thought that we might be able to put it in the pulp after we spread it out, substituting it for the maple leaves that would be used for that in washi. I make a message card with leaves arranged along the edges of the page, like a bookmark or a piece of nice stationery. I also cut up some of the leaves into smaller pieces, then scatter them on another page in a heart shape, making something kind of like chiyogami.1\n\n\n On the message card, I write “Because of you, Mister Benno, we were able to make this paper. Thank you very much.” Lutz and I sign our names at the bottom.\n\n\n “This paper is really pretty,” says Lutz, looking at the other sheet.\n\n\n “Since it’s got leglas in it, it’s kinda showy, like it’s got a picture drawn on it, you know?”\n\n\n “What are you going to do with it?”\n\n\n “I’m going to make origami,” I reply.\n\n\n “Oh-ree-gah-mee?”\n\n\n I take the chiyogami-like paper I made and use my knife to cut it into a square, then fold it into a celebration crane.2 In my old memories, shuriken patterns were the most popular with people from overseas, but I don’t know if anyone here has ever seen a throwing star before. I don’t have enough paper to make something large like an origami balloon, either.\n\n\n A celebration crane is a simple, yet flashy design that I can make with a single sheet of paper. Since its tail spreads out wide, like a peacock, it’s far more extravagant than an ordinary crane.\n\n\n “What do you think? Is this showy enough?”\n\n\n “…Wh, whoa,” he says, timidly, lightly poking at the crane. “You can make paper do something like this? Man, I have no idea what you’re capable of, Maine.”\n\n\n I’m a little taken aback by his reaction.\n\n\n How much would a crane like this be worth?\n\n\n “…Now that I think about it, making decorations out of paper would be super extravagant, wouldn’t it?”\n\n\n “A~ah, w…, well, since it’s for Master Benno, it’s alright.”\n\n\n I’d been thinking that origami was lighthearted, cheap, and comparatively unusual, so it would make a nice gift, but now that I’m actually thinking about how expensive paper is here, I’m wondering if I’ve just done something monumentally wasteful.\n\n\n …I wonder if I should make sure to tell Benno that he can unfold it and still use the paper, despite the creases?\n\n\n “I was also told that information about some kind of new product would be good…”\n\n\n “You’ve got better ideas for that than me, right?” asks Lutz offhandedly, shoving the entire burden onto me.\n\n\n It’s not that I have no ideas whatsoever, but I don’t know if any of them are actually at all salable, so I want to ask Lutz for his opinions.\n\n\n “…When we first met Benno, he looked pretty interested in my hairpin, so I was wondering if we should teach him about those, but this,” I say, pointing at my head, “is basically just a wooden stick, isn’t it?”\n\n\n Lutz gives a big nod. “Yeah, you’re right. It’s just a stick.”\n\n\n “You think he could sell them?”\n\n\n “…People can make them themselves, so it’s not the kind of thing you’d really just go out and buy, I think?”\n\n\n I’d thought that, even though it was unusual, it wouldn’t really be salable, and Lutz seems to agree.\n\n\n “If you want hairpins you can sell, how about that other kind? …You know, like the one Tory wore during her baptism, or like that.”\n\n\n “Lutz, you’re a genius! That got an amazing reaction back then, too! And I think making those would be great to do for our winter work, too.”\n\n\n With this, we’ve completed our preparations for what we’re bringing to Benno. Next, we need to figure out the circumstances, then make some time with him to meet.\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz. When you go return the lock today, could you ask Mister Mark what Mister Benno’s schedule looks like?”\n\n\n “Yeah, sure thing.”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n On the day that we arranged with Mark, Lutz and I head to Benno’s shop, bringing with us the completed paper. Our finished product has both tronbay- and forin-based papers, each in three different thicknesses, for a total of six different varieties. With that, we also are bringing the message card and origami celebratory crane, into which leglas has been pressed for color. I also have Tory’s hairpin in my tote bag as well, so that we can consult with him about it.\n\n\n “Good morning, Mister Benno. We’ve finished a prototype of our paper, and have brought it with us. We were able to finish it so quickly thanks to your generous initial investment.”\n\n\n “I heard about it from Otto, but you’re done already?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir. Here it is.”\n\n\n I draw the sheets of paper from my tote bag, then arrange them on Benno’s desk in front of him. When he sees them, he looks at them with slight amazement, then reaches out for the first sheet.\n\n\n “Well now, let’s take a look.”\n\n\n He holds it up to the light and tests it for feel, then takes out a bottle of ink. He tears off the top part of one of the sheets, then draws a line across it with his pen.\n\n\n “…This is good for writing on. The nib doesn’t get caught in this as easily as in parchment, so it’s easy to write… though the ink is spreading just a little bit. Not enough to make a difference though… hmm!”\n\n\n “Did we do it?!” I ask. “Can Lutz be your apprentice?”\n\n\n Benno strokes his chin, grinning broadly as he reaches for the next sheet.\n\n\n “Yeah, I did promise that, after all. How many of these can you make?”\n\n\n “Ummm, since this is just a prototype, if we start making it for real, I want to use larger tools. I think that these sheets are a little too small. What would be the best size of sheet for us to be making?”\n\n\n The letters of introduction I saw at the gate were all different sizes, so I don’t know what the standard would actually be for making paper. If we were to be making paper the same size as actual washi, the paper frame we’d need would be far too large, and it would take a tremendous amount of strength to spread out the pulp evenly over it. If Lutz and I aren’t able to make consistent, quality paper at that scale, there’s no point in trying, so I want to focus on mass-producing paper of the most widely-used size.\n\n\n “…Hm, let me see. For letters of introduction and contracts, we usually use sheets about this size. It’s not a precise standard, though.”\n\n\n The sheet of parchment that Benno pulled out from the shelves behind him is sized somewhere between an A4 or a B4 sheet of paper.3 It’s a size big enough that we can still swing the paper frame by hand.\n\n\n “Okay, I’d like to make another paper frame, of about that size. Although, it’s only going to be practical to make paper again in the springtime. For now, we really can’t keep getting raw materials.”\n\n\n “Just get all your tools in order by springtime, then. Work with Mark on that. This’ll be a great product once you’ve done that.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir!”\n\n\n Benno’s given his approval of our paper. Thrilled that our hard work has finally paid off, I exchange a look with Lutz, smiling broadly.\n\n\n “This is a much higher-quality paper, huh.”\n\n\n The sheet he currently holds in his hands is one of the ones made from tronbay. At a single glance, the difference in quality is obvious. It is both much whiter and much smoother.\n\n\n “This was made using tronbay.”\n\n\n “Did you say tronbay?!”\n\n\n Benno’s head snaps up, startled, and he looks back and forth between me and Lutz. It looks like tronbay really is famous for being such a dangerous plant. I take a step back, letting Lutz give the explanation as to what happened so that I don’t inadvertently say something foolish. Lutz, reading my intentions perfectly, takes a step forward, opening his mouth to speak.\n\n\n “While we were gathering things in the forest, Maine stumbled across tronbay that had just started growing, which is how we got this. It’s very dangerous to get, though, and finding it is unreliable, so I think it will be very rare for us to make.”\n\n\n “Well, I guess that makes sense… Still, tronbay, huh…”\n\n\n Benno seems to be frantically thinking if there’s anything he might be able to do to make mass-production of this happen. Despite the fact that he’s making that calculating merchant’s expression, it seems that this is the rare case where he can’t actually come up with a way to get what he wants.\n\n\n “After several tests, we determined that tronbay was the material that made the best quality material, but we can’t make it into a commodity if we can’t actually acquire the raw ingredients. Also, this paper here is made from forin. Since forin is much easier to find, it’s much better suited towards mass-production, and thus commoditization.”\n\n\n “Ah, I see,” says Benno, nodding vigorously. “Forin is definitely much better for production.”\n\n\n Since it seems that the paper has met his satisfaction, next I take out the thank-you gifts.\n\n\n “Now, this is… a thank-you note, to you, Mister Benno. I heard from Mister Otto that the best way to thank you would be to show you how we could add value to the paper we’ve made, so we tried making a special paper for you.”\n\n\n “A thank-you note? I’ve given these to some high-ranking noblemen, but this is the first time I’ve gotten one myself. How do I say this… I feel like I’m moving up in the world.”\n\n\n Benno smiles broadly as he takes the message card from me. When he opens it to look inside, his eyes go just a little bit wider.\n\n\n “Um,” I say, “while we were making this page, we added leglas to the mixture. …What do you think?”\n\n\n “Ah? When you say ‘leglas’, you’re talking about that weed that sprouts here and there around this time of year? …When you see it like this, it’s rather beautiful. This would be quite popular with the noblewomen and their daughters, I think.”\n\n\n Benno, as a merchant, is very reliable: as soon as he saw that, his thoughts immediately went to trade. He looked at it with his merchants eyes and judged it as something that he could sell to the nobility. I’m sure that we’ve successfully shown to him that we’ve managed to add some additional value to this paper.\n\n\n “Ummm, and I don’t know whether to say that this is a thank-you, or a gift, but… this is a decoration that I made from paper. It’s called a 'celebration crane’.”\n\n\n “Hoh! This is paper, too?”\n\n\n I take the folded crane from my bag, spread its tail back out, and set it on the desk in front of him. He reaches over to pick it up, his eyes gleaming. He turns it over in his hands, looking at it from all angles, but no matter how hard he looks, he won’t find any use for it besides as a decoration.\n\n\n “After I made it, I realized that I’d just done something very extravagant. It doesn’t have any use other than as a decoration. Um, though, since the paper is only folded, you can use it as regular paper again if you unfold it, although there will still be creases.”\n\n\n “No, it’s just fine being a decoration, isn’t it? This seems like a good advertisement for the paper I’ll be selling in my shop.”\n\n\n Benno places the crane on one of the shelves behind him, murmuring that once he starts selling paper he’ll need to move it to those shelves instead. It seems like the little crane will be living on a shelf for a while. Honestly, I had no idea that origami was going to be this well-received. In retrospect, I’m actually a little glad I made it.\n\n\n “To be honest,” says Benno, “I didn’t think you could make paper out of wood. The quality is also far beyond what I was expecting it to be, if you even could. This, however, is more than good enough to sell as a commodity. Well done! I’m looking forward to seeing you start mass-producing this in the spring.”\n\n\n When Benno delivers his high valuation of our efforts, Lutz and I grab each other’s hands joyfully. Thinking back on all the time we spent gradually improving the quality of the product, I’m suddenly moved to tears.\n\n\n “We did it, Maine!”\n\n\n “It’s 'cause you worked so hard, Lutz.”\n\n\n Benno smiles wryly at the two of us, stacking the paper back up on top of his desk.\n\n\n “I’ll buy this paper from you today. I’ll pay you on the way out, so call Mark for me?”\n\n\n “Really?!”\n\n\n Now that I think about it, we had talked about how, before our baptism, we would get to keep the money from selling the paper, minus material and handling fees.\n\n\n Finally, my first real cash!\n\n\n If we turn the rest of our processed white bark into paper now, then we can probably sell that too. As soon as I think that, I suddenly remember something else, and I take Tory’s hairpin, which I wanted to talk about selling, from my bag.\n\n\n “…Also, I had something I wanted to consult with you about; do you think that this is something that we could sell?”\n\n\n I place the hairpin that Tory had used as a hair ornament on top of Benno’s desk. It’s a short wooden pin, decorated with a bouquet of small blue and yellow flowers.\n\n\n For some reason, Benno’s face twitches and goes very stiff as soon as he sees the hairpin.\n\n\n “Young lady, what is this?”\n\n\n “It’s a hair ornament. After someone ties her hair back normally with a string, she can then use this to decorate it. …Like this.”\n\n\n To demonstrate, I swap out Tory’s hairpin for my own and show it to him.\n\n\n “This particular one is something that I made for my older sister’s baptismal ceremony, so I can’t sell it, but if I make more decorations like this while I’m doing my winter handiwork, do you think I could be able to sell them?”\n\n\n As I ask my question, Benno keeps his glittering eyes fixed on the hairpin. In a low voice, he growls out an answer.\n\n\n “…You could.”\n\n\n “Then, I think I will. Then, um. Mister Benno, I’ll let you sell them for me, so would it maybe be possible for you to provide the initial investment for these too, please?”\n\n\n He lets a loud, long sigh, then looks me in the eyes. He suddenly seems very, very tired, but I wonder if I’m just imagining it?\n\n\n “What on earth do you need?”\n\n\n “Just thread. The quality doesn’t need to be particularly high, but I’d like as many different colors as possible, please.”\n\n\n Making every single one of them using the same colors would be very boring. Besides, I’m sure that everyone is going to want to pick ones with colors that match them the best, so it’s a good idea to have as many colors and designs as possible.\n\n\n “Just thread? Nothing else?”\n\n\n “I’d be happy if we could get a little wood, but since we’re already going to be gathering a lot of firewood for the winter, we don’t particularly need it.”\n\n\n “And you’re doing all this yourself, young lady?”\n\n\n Benno glances at me, scowling. Now that I think about it, I’m pretty sure we’re in a “Maine thinks, Lutz makes” kind of situation. Perhaps it would be best for Lutz to help out as well.\n\n\n “…Lutz will handle the woodworking portion, and I plan on handling the rest. Of course, we’ll be making them together. Right, Lutz?”\n\n\n “Right,” he says, gripping my hand tightly as he nods frantically. “I’ll handle the wood parts.”\n\n\n Benno scrutinizes us carefully, looking like he has something he wants to say, but then sits back, covering it up with a forced, happy smile.\n\n\n “Well, sounds good to me. So, you two, do you have some time and energy to move around a bit?”\n\n\n “Yes, we do.”\n\n\n “Alright. So, let’s head to the Merchant’s Guild, shall we?”\n\n\n “The Merchant’s Guild?!”\n\n\n Whoa, once again, some new vocabulary just showed up. I wonder, is this going to be like a medieval European guild, or a fantasy world guild…? What the heck kind of place is this going to be?\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. Chiyogami is brightly-colored, patterned paper used for a variety of decorative purposes. It’s typically made by applying a pattern to the paper using ink applied either through wood block printing or through silkscreening.\n\n\n 2. Celebration cranes are very showy origami cranes with wide tails folded so that both sides of the paper, which are usually different colors, are outwardly visible.\n\n\n 3. For American audiences, A4 paper is slightly skinnier and slightly taller than letter paper (8.3\" x 11.7\") and B4 paper is about as tall as legal paper but somewhat wider (9.8\" x 13.9\")."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Currently, I am being held in Benno’s arms as we make our way to the Merchant’s Guild. Originally, I was making every effort to walk there myself, but Benno started to get fed up with my walking speed. “So slow! This is a waste of my time,” he said, and picked me up. Then, he started ranting on and on about the importance of time, which I had no real way to argue against.\n\n\n “By the way, Mister Benno,” I say. “What is the Merchant’s Guild?”\n\n\n Finding out all of the little details that are different from what I think I know is my top priority.\n\n\n “What, you don’t know?”\n\n\n “I’ve never been to it. Lutz, do you know about it?”\n\n\n “It’s a place where people who do business go, maybe?”\n\n\n I asked Lutz just in case this was something that any child in this town should know about, but all I got out of him was what I was expecting. Benno sighs lightly, then starts to explain.\n\n\n “…Well, that’s about right. Its main job is to do things like grant permits to people who want to open new shops or punish people who are doing bad business. If you don’t have the guild’s approval, you can’t run a shop and you can’t open a stall in the town market. Also, every person involved in a business must be registered; if they aren’t, the guild lays down very harsh penalties.”\n\n\n Based on what I’m hearing from Benno, I guess it might be something like a department of commerce? You can’t open a shop without getting approval, and you have to register new apprentices there, so I don’t think I’m too far off the mark.\n\n\n “They sound like they’re a very powerful organization,” I say.\n\n\n “That’s right. They’ve very powerful, and very greedy. When you register an apprentice, there’s a registration fee. When you start a new business, there’s a very large registration fee. No matter what you do, they take a commission from it.”\n\n\n It looks like things are the same whenever money is involved, no matter what world you live in. This is a terrible world for a poor person to live in.\n\n\n “Either way, once the baptismal ceremony is over, my new apprentices are registered here, since everyone working at my store is involved in trade. In your case, you’ll need a provisional registration until your actual baptism. If you don’t, then you won’t be able to sell your paper or your hair ornaments… or any kind of good.”\n\n\n “So, in order to buy the paper from us today, you need us to be registered first?”\n\n\n “Right.”\n\n\n Ah, I see. His rush to get us registered is so that he can purchase our prototype paper. I chuckle to myself, pleased that I figured that out. Benno, however, gets a stern look on his face, his eyebrows knotting together.\n\n\n “I’d really like to get you through registration quickly, but that old bastard is going to get involved. Every time, that man never fails to find some bone to pick.”\n\n\n “Like what?”\n\n\n Benno’s brought out some less-than-friendly language. I thought that he’d be fairly high up in the guild himself; was I wrong? Or, perhaps, is there some sort of inter-factional dispute happening here?\n\n\n “Right now, I’ve got a lot of momentum going, expanding on a few different ventures so I can grow my shop. It’s only natural that the guild chief would want to tear me down a little, you know? So, you two, don’t say anything unnecessary, got it?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir,” I say, in unison with Lutz. Two highly skilled merchants are about to engage in a battle of wits against each other. I have no plans to stick my nose in where it doesn’t belong.\n\n\n “Ah, that’s right. Maine, about that hairpin you brought…”\n\n\n “This one?” I say, opening my bag slightly to show it to him.\n\n\n He nods, then fixes his sharp, reddish-brown eyes on me. “How long does it take you to make one?”\n\n\n “If I already have all the materials, and Lutz makes the wooden part, then after that, if my physical condition is good… ummm, this flower part, if I work really hard I can do it in a day, probably… I guess…”\n\n\n It depends on the actual quantity of flowers, but at my speed it’s a day’s worth of work. My mother, though, who is good at sewing, could probably do it in about two bells’ worth of time.\n\n\n “How about you, Lutz?” asks Benno.\n\n\n “It’s just carving and polishing some wood, so it’ll take me about one bell, I think?”\n\n\n “Hmm! That’s great,” he says, good-naturedly.\n\n\n Benno’s tone of voice may be light and pleasant, but his eyes glitter with a sharp light.\n\n\n “What’s so great?” I ask.\n\n\n “I’m looking forward to what’s coming up after this,” he replies, smiling the same vicious smile a predator makes when it’s found its next target, his eyes locked on the Merchant’s Guild building as it comes into view.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The Merchant’s Guild is in a tall building on a street corner that overlooks the town’s central plaza. Just that alone shows that it is a very wealthy organization, but on top of that, not a single room in the entire building has been rented out to anyone else. The entire building is the Merchant’s Guild’s alone.\n\n\n “When I think about how much of my hard-earned money gets funneled into this building,” muses Benno, “I can’t help but get a little mad, you know?”\n\n\n “That’s true, but if you didn’t, you’d be in big trouble, wouldn’t you?”\n\n\n “Yep. And that makes me even madder.”\n\n\n Before the door stand two guards, each carrying weapons. As we approach, they look us up and down, then ask us what our business is here.\n\n\n “What are you here for?”\n\n\n “Getting temporary registrations for these two,” replies Benno.\n\n\n “Head on in,” says the guard, opening the door for us.\n\n\n As soon as we step through the doorway, we’re suddenly faced with a flight of stairs, and I’m momentarily bewildered. While the staircase itself is wide, there’s no sign of the first floor at all.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, what happened to the first floor?”\n\n\n “Ahh, the first floor is for the traders to park their wagons and carts. It would be a huge nuisance if they all were lined up on the street outside. If you go around back, you should be able to see them.”\n\n\n We ascend to the second floor, entering a large hall, packed full of people constantly rushing about. I can’t help but be amazed by the overwhelming clamor. I hadn’t thought this town had this kind of people in it, until now. I feel a strange sort of admiration.\n\n\n “We don’t have anything to do here,” says Benno. “We’re heading to the stairs on the other side so we can get up to the third floor.”\n\n\n Since I’m still being carried in Benno’s arms, I’m relatively safe as we make our way through the crowd towards the stairway, but Lutz, following behind us, keeps almost getting crushed in the crowd.\n\n\n “Lutz, are you alright?” I ask.\n\n\n “I’m fine, yeah… This is kinda like a festival, huh.”\n\n\n “That’s because this is the place where both people who want to open stalls in the town market and traders who want to do business in this town have to come to get official permission,” says Benno. “The closer it gets to market, the busier it gets. After the market closes, it’ll be quiet for a while.”\n\n\n “Huh…”\n\n\n The stairs we arrive at are sealed tightly behind a metal fence. In front of it stand yet more guards.\n\n\n “May I see your registration card, please?”\n\n\n Benno pulls out some sort of metallic-looking card and hands it to the guard. “The three of us are going up.”\n\n\n “Understood, sir.”\n\n\n For some reason, the guard holds the card up high. Suddenly, a brilliant white light runs along the bars of the fence, and it disappears into the ground as if it were melting away.\n\n\n “Wha–?! What’s that!!” I ask, my eyes wide.\n\n\n “A magical tool. Lutz, don’t let go of my hand. You’ll be pushed back if you do.”\n\n\n “G… got it.”\n\n\n Benno carries me with one arm, taking Lutz’s hand in the other, and starts to ascend the staircase.\n\n\n “Didn’t you say that magic was something that only the nobility could use?” I ask.\n\n\n “The upper levels of this organization are pretty well-connected with the nobility. There’s quite a lot of noblemen who’d give out magical tools like this if they thought it would give them some kind of advantage.”\n\n\n “It’s my first time seeing anything like this…”\n\n\n I’m struck by the same thought as I had back when I saw the contract magic. Somehow, I’ve found myself in a world that’s even more fantastical than I thought.\n\n\n When we reach the top of the stairs, Benno lets go of Lutz’ hand and sets me down. White walls extend past the stairway for a ways, until they arrive at a place in the back that looks something like a counter. While the second story handled business relating to the town market, the third story deals with the merchants who own shops. Compared to the second story, it is much quieter, and there are far fewer people here.\n\n\n The floor of the second story was made of wood and slightly dirty, with small piles of dust accumulating in the corners. The third story, however, is carpeted, and swept scrupulously clean. The furniture is also well-maintained here, further emphasizing that this place has plenty of money. This is, in a single glance, a stunning example of how stratified this society is.\n\n\n “There are conference rooms on the other side of these walls,” says Benno, pointing at the white walls. “You two won’t have much need to use them.”\n\n\n As he explains things, we start walking towards the counter. Lutz and I hold each other’s hands, feeling slightly nervous in the face of the kind of wealth that we don’t ordinarily see in our daily lives.\n\n\n Passing the conference rooms, I can see that the counters stretch wall-to-wall, behind which children, perhaps apprentices, seem to be processing the income and expenditures of the Merchant’s Guild, reading from wooden notes and performing computations on their manual calculators.\n\n\n “Lutz,” I whisper, “this winter you really need to learn how to read and do math.”\n\n\n “…Yeah, I really do.”\n\n\n Partway down the corridor, on this side of the counter, there’s something that looks like a sofa in what appears to be a waiting area, or perhaps a reception area where one could be invited to relax. I turn around, surveying my surroundings. I notice, against one wall, a set of shelves on which a variety of wooden cards and rolls of parchment have been arranged.\n\n\n “Is that… is that a bookshelf?!”\n\n\n My energy level suddenly skyrockets. Benno looks down at me with curiosity in his eyes, then nods.\n\n\n “Yeah, those are bookshelves. They contain copies of the regulations that apply to shops, simple maps of the surrounding area, almanacs of the nobility, and so on. …Are you interested?”\n\n\n “I am! I am!!”\n\n\n I want to immediately charge towards the bookshelves, but Lutz’s grip on my hand is like a vise, squeezing so tightly that I can’t get away. Watching me struggle, a wry smile tugs at the corners of Benno’s mouth.\n\n\n “You can take a look after we’ve gotten your application filled out. It’ll probably be a long wait, after all.”\n\n\n “Really?! Yaaay!”\n\n\n “Maine,” says Lutz, “calm down. You’re getting too excited.”\n\n\n I’ve finally found book-like things that are okay for me to read, do you think I can possibly contain myself? No, I absolutely cannot. Lutz’s warning technically does register in my ears, but it’s nowhere near enough to stop the wild dancing of my heart.\n\n\n At least, that’s what I thought, until Lutz says something that forces me to stop dead in my tracks.\n\n\n “If you get too excited, you’ll faint before you get a chance to read anything.”\n\n\n …That would be terrible!\n\n\n Benno, who has been watching our exchange with some amusement, notices that this is a good breaking point. “Come,” he says, continuing to walk towards the counter. As we approach, an employee that seems to be familiar with Benno looks up, an ingratiating smile on her face.\n\n\n “Oh, good afternoon, Master Benno. How may I be of service today?”\n\n\n “I’m here for temporary registration for these two. Can you handle both of them for me?”\n\n\n “Temporary registration? …These aren’t your children, are they?”\n\n\n “They’re not. But, I need them registered. Quickly, please.”\n\n\n It seems that a temporary registration is effectively a loophole in the regulations, where the children of merchants can be allowed to help out with the family business even though they’re unbaptized and, by all rights, should not be allowed to be working, let alone be registered. Since it’s impossible to hire a child that hasn’t yet been baptized, children who aren’t directly related to a merchant would thus have no actual reason to be involved in any transactions. As such, it’s impossible that a temporary registration would be granted to a child that isn’t a blood relative of a merchant.\n\n\n Although she squints dubiously at us, she dutifully begins to ask me and Lutz a series of questions, writing something down on the other side of the counter. From what I’d heard so far, I had been thinking this would be a long, bureaucratic process, but this is just simple data entry: our names, our fathers’ names, where we live, our ages.\n\n\n “The son of a carpenter and the daughter of a soldier, is it?”\n\n\n When she finishes her questions, her expression grows all the more dubious as she looks back and forth between the two of us. It seems that she’s searching for some reason why we should be registered, even though we’re not the children of merchants. Her eyes are not exceptionally pleasant.\n\n\n “That’s right,” says Benno. “If you’re done with the questions, let’s move this along. I don’t think either of us have much free time to spare on this.”\n\n\n “Very well, I’ll be back shortly. Please, feel free to sit over there while you wait.”\n\n\n She gestures towards the reception area. I’m nearly crushed by my desire to immediately run off to the bookshelves, but I instead look up at Benno.\n\n\n “While we wait, may I look at the bookshelves?”\n\n\n “Sure. If there’s anything you’d like to know, I can show you. Come and wait over here. Lutz, don’t let her out of your sight.”\n\n\n “Got it.”\n\n\n Lutz and I calmly walk to the bookshelves, his hand clamped firmly around mine. I go through the contents of the shelves, unrolling the parchment scrolls and glancing through the stacks of wooden cards, looking to see what kind of information they contain. It’s all eminently practical information: maps and illustrated references, almanacs of the nobility, rules of business, block-printed news sheets with information from nearby areas, and so on.\n\n\n “Whoa, look at this map!”\n\n\n It’s a particularly rough and sketchy map, but this is the first time I’ve gotten a look at what this world looks like. I have no idea where even we currently are on this, so I tuck the scroll under my arm and head to the sofa where Benno is currently sitting. I sit down on the sofa in the manner in which one usually sits down on a sofa, only to realize that this beautiful clothy surface is, in fact, merely a piece of cloth attached to the hard boards of the wooden bench underneath. It has none of the softness or flexibility I was expecting, so instead my butt slams hard into the unyielding surface.\n\n\n “Owww…”\n\n\n “How excited do you have to be to throw yourself into a chair like that. Are you an idiot?”\n\n\n I whimper softly as Benno stares at me with frank amazement. I was deceived by something that looked like a luxurious sofa in this strange environment, you know! If I had been able to see the wood this is made of, I wouldn’t have thrown myself into it like that. I keep these excuses in my heart, though, as I spread the map wide on the cloth-covered surface of the bench we are sitting on.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, where’s this town on here?”\n\n\n “Right here. Ehrenfest. That’s the family name of the lord of the land, so that’s the name of the town.”\n\n\n This is the first time I’ve heard the name of this town. Come to think of it, this is the first time I’ve heard the name of the lord, too. Since there’s not been any reason for me to go outside the town, there’s never been any need for me to learn its name, and whenever people refer to the lord they just refer to him by his title.\n\n\n Looking at the map, it seems that there is an agricultural village and a forest to the south of Ehrenfest, and if you go beyond that, there’s another small town. To the west, there’s a large river, with another town belonging to the neighboring province relatively close by. Since the lords of those provinces share a good relationship, it seems that it’s popular to come and go between those two cities. To the north is the aristocratic town where the feudal lord resides, so there’s a large blank area. To the east, a major highway stretches, where it appears the largest number of traders operate.\n\n\n “Well, when you two wind up going outside the town to do any purchasing, you’re probably not going to need to go off this map, anyway.”\n\n\n After Benno teaches us the names of a few of the other towns on the map, I return the map to the shelves, and once again start going through every last document on the shelves. On the very bottommost shelf, there are books that seem to be intended for apprentices to learn how to read words and numbers. Lutz and I flip through it to study its contents. In addition to the words I already know, I see quite a few more vocabulary words relating to commerce. I want some time to memorize all of these.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, could we maybe get a slate and a calculator so that Lutz can study…?”\n\n\n “Sure, I’ll take the cost out of your pay today and get those for you. Study hard, kid.”\n\n\n “By the way, could you tell me something, please? When a merchant’s kid becomes an apprentice, how well can they read, write, and do math already?”\n\n\n After we’re baptized, the two of us will be working as apprentices with the children of merchants. Until then, we need to do as much as we can to make sure that we can do all of the things that they can do.\n\n\n “They can read and write simple things and do basic calculations. For reading, they mostly know the names and related words of the goods their family trades in. For math, they know how to do the conversions between copper and silver coins, too.”\n\n\n This is bad. I don’t really know anything about the local currency. I already know that large and small copper coins exist, as well as small silver coins, but I don’t know what the exchange rate between them is, nor their actual market value.\n\n\n After all, at my house, all we really use is copper.\n\n\n I don’t think I’ve ever really seen many coins that weren’t made of copper. Also, when I’m doing my work at the gate, I’m only working with raw numbers. Otto handles all of the actual money, and I haven’t really seen him do it.\n\n\n “I think where the two of you are most lacking is knowing how to treat customers. The other children have watched their parents at work every single day, so it’s basically instinct for them by now.”\n\n\n “That’s…”\n\n\n That’s impossible for the two of us. In Japan, I was only ever on the receiving side of customer service, and never actually stood behind the register myself. Lutz, as well, probably knows nothing that a merchant might actually know.\n\n\n What should we do?\n\n\n Before I can fall too deeply into a labyrinth of thought, the employee behind the counter calls out to us.\n\n\n “Master Benno, the guild leader would like to meet with you.”\n\n\n “…As expected of that old bastard,” he mutters, in a voice so low that only we can hear it.\n\n\n He stands up from his seat, eyes glittering coldly, his hands tightly balled into fists, the very picture of a man preparing to head into battle.\n\n\n “Let’s go, you two.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir.”\n\n\n Benno starts heading towards the counter. With a clink, the closest panel to us on the counter falls to one side, opening a path for us to go through. On the other side is another staircase, at the top of which is a door that opens automatically for us. Through it lies a room that, although it’s not particularly large, seems very comfortable.\n\n\n A fire is already burning brightly in the fireplace, spreading warm light across the carpet. On top of that carpet stands an official-looking desk, with a gentle-looking old man who, despite seeming to be in his fifties, still possesses a somewhat decent physique. Since “guild leader” sounds very much like a purely managerial position, I had been imagining a much more grandfatherly type, but I can see that this man has not yet aged past the prime of his life.\n\n\n “Hey there, welcome,” he says, standing up from behind his desk with a warm, genial smile. “I’m glad I could get a chance to chat with you.\n\n\n \"Now then, Benno, let me get straight to the point. Why on earth are you asking for a temporary registration for these two kids, who aren’t even your blood relatives? This isn’t at all like when someone managing a street stall comes to ask for permission for their kid to watch the shop for them from time to time, am I right?”\n\n\n A crafty smile crosses the guild leader’s face, silently telling us that Benno’s insistence that the two of us be immediately registered without first waiting for our baptismal ceremony is basically exactly the same thing as him saying that the two of us possess some sort of goods that it is worth getting us registered for.\n\n\n “…If I don’t know what you’re trying to do,” he says, “I can’t give permission to get these kids registered, you know. There’s no precedent at all here in Ehrenfest for registering kids that aren’t blood relatives.”\n\n\n The guild leader looks the both of us over, with a contemplative smile that is completely impossible for me to read. His smile and his general demeanor seemed quite friendly at first glance, but this man is truly not friendly at all. After all, he just threatened us with rejection if Benno doesn’t immediately answer his question.\n\n\n Seeing the guild leader waiting expectantly for an answer is making me grow increasingly nervous, so I look up at Benno to see how he’s taking it. However, Benno wears the darkly triumphant look of a man who feels absolutely assured of his victory.\n\n\n “You want to know what these two kids have that I want, yeah?” he says, smiling broadly.\n\n\n “Yeah, I guess I do. Since it’s a thing, after all, any store could probably trade them, after all. Your shop is starting to reach a little too wide, I’m thinking.”\n\n\n If it’s something that could make some real money, he wants a chance to seize it, he’s saying. Mister, shouldn’t you be at least trying to hide your real intentions?\n\n\n “These kids have said they want to sell things through my shop, so they’re going to sell them through my shop. Right, Maine? Am I right, Lutz?”\n\n\n We’re still scared of accidentally saying something unnecessarily, like Benno warned us not to do, so the two of us gulp, then nod emphatically. Benno smiles even more brightly, then looks down at me.\n\n\n “Maine, please show the guild leader the hairpins that you’d like to start selling at my shop.”\n\n\n “…Understood, sir.”\n\n\n It seems that Benno still intends to keep our new paper trade secret for now. I don’t know what thought process he took to arrive at this conclusion, but since I don’t want to say anything I shouldn’t, I keep my mouth firmly shut as I reach into my tote bag. I pull out Tory’s hairpin, and hold it out for the guild leader to see.\n\n\n A moment later, the guild leader’s expression completely changes."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “This…” murmurs the guild leader, transfixed.\n\n\n The only time Tory used this hairpin was during her baptismal ceremony. What happened on that day, I wonder? I’m a little shocked about how suddenly the guild leader’s aloof smile completely disappeared, so I look back at Benno, seeking some kind of assistance.\n\n\n The guild leader’s captivated by this, is he okay?\n\n\n While I may be worried, Benno is clearly not. A terrifying expression flickers across his face, like a carnivore licking his chops, before it settles back into his usual darkly pleasant smile.\n\n\n “Is this not the hairpin you’ve been searching for, Guild Leader?”\n\n\n “You’re selling this?!” asks the guild leader, his eyes wide, looking back and forth between me and Benno. There isn’t a trace of a smile on his face anymore as he looks at us hungrily. Terrified, I can’t stop my breath from catching in my throat.\n\n\n …Lutz, no fair! You’re hiding behind Benno!\n\n\n I turn slightly to try to creep behind Benno as well, but he firmly clasps my shoulder, dragging me back to the forefront.\n\n\n “Umm,” I stammer, “I was planning on making these during my winter work.”\n\n\n “Your winter work… then, could you sell me that one right now?”\n\n\n He reaches out as if to take Tory’s hairpin from me. His blazing eyes tell me that if he gets his hands on it I’ll never get it back, so I frantically shove it back into my bag.\n\n\n “I can’t do that,” I say. “This is something I made for Tory. It’s not for sale.”\n\n\n “I’ll buy it for this much,” he says, his hand coming up in a flash, three fingers standing straight up. That’s probably some sort of sign to indicate a value, but I don’t know what exactly it means.\n\n\n Flustered, I look up at Benno for advice.\n\n\n “Hmm, I see…” he says, grinning broadly. “If we could ask for a little more, we might be able to make one in advance especially for you, sir. What do you think, Maine?”\n\n\n “It’s… it’s just like Mister Benno says, sir.”\n\n\n As if I could possibly refuse. I force a smile onto my face and comply with his implicit order.\n\n\n “If she starts now,” he says, “She should have plenty of time to complete it before your granddaughter’s baptismal ceremony this winter. Isn’t that right, Maine?”\n\n\n “Yes, more than enough time.”\n\n\n …Ah, now I see. During the summer’s baptismal ceremony, the guild leader’s granddaughter must have seen Tory’s hairpin and said that she wanted something just like it.\n\n\n With that one statement, everything finally snaps into place. As the leader of the Merchant’s Guild, this man would be the most informed person in the entire city about the flow of merchandise through the markets, but even so, he couldn’t find a trace of this hairpin. Since it’s something I made entirely in-house, solely for Tory, it was never on the market, and nothing else like it is sold anywhere, he must be growing more and more nervous as the day of the winter’s baptismal ceremonies draws ever closer.\n\n\n “There’s barely a month left, are you sure you can finish it?”\n\n\n Come to think of it, making the flowers requires a surprisingly large amount of both time and thread, so in this extremely hectic season, unlike during the winter season where we’re shut inside by the snow and have nothing else to do, we don’t have time for making random things, or so my mother said. However, if this is a job that I’d be making money on, there might not be any problem with me devoting all of my time to it. Since I’ll need to procure the thread and talk to the granddaughter about her specific request, it’ll take somewhat more time than otherwise, but if I have until the winter baptismal ceremony, I should have more than enough time.\n\n\n “Yes, sir. This hairpin isn’t for sale, but there won’t be any trouble making a new one.”\n\n\n “Yeah,” says Lutz, nodding emphatically, “we can do it.”\n\n\n Next to me, Benno has been grinning broadly as he listens to our conversation.\n\n\n “However,” he interjects, “since I can’t register these two, when they finally finish making the hairpin, they most unfortunately won’t be able to sell it…”\n\n\n “Tsk… Fine then, after we get their temporary registrations complete, let’s work out the details of the order…”\n\n\n With that, Benno’s victory over the guild leader seems to have been clinched. The guild leader was unable to find serious fault with him, he didn’t reveal any information about the paper, and he was able to secure our temporary registrations. In high spirits, he turns to head out of the guild leader’s office.\n\n\n “Well then, shall we go back downstairs?”\n\n\n “Hold up,” says the guild leader. “I can take care of their guild cards in here, so why don’t you let the children wait here? I’d like to work out the details of the order, too.”\n\n\n Benno clucks his tongue quietly, then looks back, smilingly, over his shoulder at the guild leader.\n\n\n “If I left the kids here alone, I don’t even know what kind of troubles they could blunder their way into, so why don’t I stay here and make sure to keep an eye on them for you?”\n\n\n “No, no, these kids seem to be very well-raised! I’m sure they won’t cause any trouble if they’re out of your sight for a minute. Right?”\n\n\n Though the guild leader may be smiling kindly, I’m scared of whatever he could be scheming underneath that. Cautious of the fact that I could be suddenly stolen away, I unthinkingly grab for Benno’s hand.\n\n\n “Th… this is the first time I’ve come here,” I say timidly, “so I want to stay with Benno.”\n\n\n “You see?”\n\n\n Smiling triumphantly, Benno sits down on the hard bench that the guild leader has in his office, picking me up and setting me on his knee. “Good work,” he murmurs in my ear, gently ruffling my hair. He seems to be in a very good mood.\n\n\n Shortly thereafter, I’m relocated to a spot on the bench next to Benno, with Lutz sitting on my other side. The guild leader sits down across from us, and we begin discussing the details of the hairpin.\n\n\n “Well then,” he says, “I want one hairpin, delivered before the baptismal ceremony.”\n\n\n “Umm… what color should I make the flowers? Do you know what colors she likes, or what might fit her hair, or…”\n\n\n “I don’t really know much about that. Just make it like that one,” he says, pointing at the pin inside my totebag.\n\n\n However, that kind of blunt declaration is actually somewhat problematic for me. I am very sure that Benno is massively overcharging the guild leader for this, so I want to make sure that I’ll be producing a product that his granddaughter is going to be absolutely delighted with. I have no doubt that this grandpa, who went to great lengths to find a hairpin for his granddaughter, thinks that her smile is the most priceless thing in the world.\n\n\n “Umm, could I maybe speak to your daughter directly and ask her about what she would like? I believe she’ll be much happier if I could do so.”\n\n\n “I want to surprise her, so I’m trying to keep this under wraps.”\n\n\n There it is! That ever-troublesome surprise gift!\n\n\n In order for someone to be truly delighted by a surprise gift, the giver needs to be very certain of the recipient’s tastes and desires, and present it to them at just the right time, when they’re thinking that they want something like that. Grandpa, though, is saying that he doesn’t even know what his granddaughter’s favorite color is, which makes a surprise gift much more challenging.\n\n\n “…Umm, well, it’s important that the hairpin matches the dress she’ll be wearing, and it should fit with her hair color as well. And if she’s already found something else that she’s going to wear in her hair, then wouldn’t she be troubled by getting a new hairpin?”\n\n\n “Ah, really?”\n\n\n Since it’s the winter ceremony, preparations are probably already underway for the dress she’ll be wearing. If that’s the case, it’s possible that her mother is also working on something for her to wear in her hair.\n\n\n “Since I’ll be making it from scratch, I feel that it’s most important that she receive something that she truly wants, even more than something that merely matches her tastes. Wouldn’t you agree that her look of joy would be more wonderful than a look of surprise?”\n\n\n “Hmm, I see…”\n\n\n The guild leader strokes his mustache, looking up at the ceiling as if in thought.\n\n\n “Maine, was it?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir.”\n\n\n “Would you like to come to my shop?”\n\n\n “She refuses!”\n\n\n Before I even have a chance to react, Benno rejects the proposal.\n\n\n “My shop is much bigger than Benno’s,” continues the guild leader, “and we trade in some very good things. It’s a great offer, isn’t it? You still haven’t actually had your baptismal ceremony and officially become apprentices yet, so it’s still possible for you to come apprentice at my shop. How about it?”\n\n\n How about it, he says, but after all of the support I’ve received from Benno so far, I have no intentions at all to do him the injustice of spontaneously switching to another shop.\n\n\n “I owe a lot to Benno that I can’t pay back,” I say.\n\n\n “Hmm, I’ll pay him back for you.”\n\n\n “What? Ummm…”\n\n\n I have every intention of refusing, but the words won’t leave my mouth. As Benno watches me waver under the guild leader’s relentless pressure, his mood grows worse and worse. His eyebrows crease together as he taps his temple repeatedly, looking at me with a dangerous glint in his eyes.\n\n\n “Maine, kindly give your response to the guild leader. Your rejection, if you would.”\n\n\n “I… I mu, mu… I must refuse!”\n\n\n “Mm, well, that’s a shame, but I guess I’ll give this up for now. You’ve got someone scary standing over you, after all, so you can’t say what you really want.”\n\n\n He’s giving up for now?! But I’m already telling him what I really want!\n\n\n “If you’re going to be meeting with Freida, my granddaughter, how does tomorrow sound? It’s better to get these decisions squared away sooner rather than later, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “Umm, couldn’t Mister Benno come with me?!”\n\n\n Earlier today, Benno had thoroughly engraved the words “don’t meet with the guild leader alone” into my consciousness. Meeting with him without someone present who can actually handle him would be very dangerous. However, the guild leader shakes his head in reply.\n\n\n “Unfortunately, both Benno and I have a meeting tomorrow. If you’re just meeting with another girl your age, you don’t need a stern old man like him watching over you, do you?”\n\n\n “…Alright, if it’s just us kids.”\n\n\n Caught in the middle of Benno’s battle with the guild leader and focused on the plan to ask Freida about her wishes, I’ve started to wear down a little, so without thinking about it too much, I consented to a meeting with only another girl my age. Benno, hearing me agree with the guild leader’s opinion, clucks his tongue disapprovingly.\n\n\n What?! Did I do something wrong?!\n\n\n I glance between Benno, whose eyebrows grow even more creased, and the guild leader, whose smile grows even wider, and suddenly realize the stupidity of my reply. By agreeing for it to only be “us kids”, I’ve made it so that Mark won’t be able to come with me. Frantically, I kick my brain into full power, looking at both sides, trying to figure out what to do.\n\n\n “S… since Lutz is going to be working on making this too, it’s alright if he comes too, right? Si… since it’s just us kids!!”\n\n\n Going entirely by myself is too scary to consider. When I suggest dragging Lutz into it too, though, Benno seems to relax just a little bit.\n\n\n “Well, that’s fine too,” says the guild leader. “Now then, how does meeting in the central plaza at the third bell sound? Freida can come out to meet you there.”\n\n\n “Sounds good, sir.”\n\n\n As if she had been waiting for the conversation to conclude, the staff member from earlier enters the room, carrying temporary membership cards. It appears that our temporary registration has been successful.\n\n\n “These are your temporary membership cards. These are magic tools as well. They’re absolutely necessary when you’re conducting any sort of business discussion. Benno can explain the fine details about that later. Since this card shows that you two are essentially a shop’s apprentices, you’ll be able to use it to access the upper floors of the building.”\n\n\n This mysterious card is made of a strange, pale metal that glimmers with rainbow colors as the light strikes it. Compared to the things I normally interact with, this is almost unnecessarily different. The more of the explanation I listen to, the more I admire this obviously fantastical card. Faced with the wonder of a magic tool, I can only blink in response.\n\n\n “Now then, the last step is for the two of you to push some of your own blood into the card so that it can recognize you. If you do that, other people won’t be able to use it arbitrarily.”\n\n\n “Wha?! B… blood?!”\n\n\n Does all magic require blood? The memory of having to slice open my finger and make a blood seal for the contract magic is still very fresh in my mind.\n\n\n “Give it up, Maine,” says Lutz.\n\n\n “Lu~uutz…”\n\n\n “It’s fine, just give me your hand. …It’s not like you’ll do it yourself, right?”\n\n\n “Oooohh…”\n\n\n Tearfully, I extend my hand. Lutz pricks my fingertip with a needle. A drop of blood immediately wells up from the wound, to which he presses the card, which seems to absorb it.\n\n\n In the next instant, it brightly flashes.\n\n\n “Whoa?!”\n\n\n It flashed with light for just a moment, but afterwards, it looked exactly like it had before. Not a trace of a bloodstain or a fingerprint has been left behind, leaving it as perfectly clean as it was before.\n\n\n Magic tools are really convenient. But scary.\n\n\n Although I had been frightened of drawing blood and startled by the card’s bright flash, Lutz finishes his own task almost disinterestedly.\n\n\n “With that,” says the guild leader, “your registration is complete.”\n\n\n “Thank you very much,” I reply.\n\n\n I run after Benno, who has already started leaving the room now that there’s no longer any reason for him to be there, then leave the Merchant’s Guild building entirely.\n\n\n All we did was get registered, but now I’m very worn out.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Welcome back, sir. It seems you were able to successfully get these two registered?”\n\n\n When we return to Benno’s shop, Mark is there waiting for us. Although from time to time I’ve seen a merchant’s dark smile cross his face, Mark is, fundamentally, a supporter, and his pleasant smile always heals me.\n\n\n “Yes!” replies Benno. “Thanks to Maine, we won a flawless victory today.”\n\n\n “Oh ho! How rare.”\n\n\n “She caught that old bastard’s eye, though.”\n\n\n “…That would seem to be rather dangerous indeed.”\n\n\n Even Mark seems to regard the guild leader as dangerous. I must agree, from the bottom of my heart.\n\n\n “Please, right this way,” he says, opening the door to Benno’s office and showing us in. “I’ve made arrangements so that we can settle the accounts regarding the prototype paper.”\n\n\n “Well then,” says Benno, “let’s wrap this up then, shall we?”\n\n\n As soon as I heard “settle the accounts”, though, my hand rocketed into the air.\n\n\n “Excuse me! I have a question. Could you please teach me about money?”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n Benno frowns, not understanding what I meant, Mark, similarly, has his head tilted to the side in puzzlement.\n\n\n “Ummm, well, until now, I’ve never actually held any money… I can read numbers very well, but I don’t know how the numbers and the money actually match up. …Let’s take 5,640 leon, for instance; I don’t have any idea at all how to use coins to pay that amount, or anything like that.”\n\n\n “What?!”\n\n\n The wild shout of disbelief was not just Benno’s. Mark and Lutz both joined in as well.\n\n\n “You…” says Benno, slowly, “haven’t touched money… Well, you’re not a merchant, and you’re such a young kid, so maybe that’s not strange? Wait, no, that still is strange, right?”\n\n\n “…Oh!” says Lutz. “She never gets sent out on errands, since she faints so easily.”\n\n\n “Ahh…” they all say, breathing a collective sigh of understanding.\n\n\n “I do calculations at the gate, but I’ve never actually watched anyone exchanging money with the merchants. When I went with Mark to go place orders, too, all we really did was hand over order forms, and we really didn’t exchange any money. I’ve been to the town market a few times with my mother, and I’ve seen her use some small coins to buy things, but I don’t know what those are or how much they’re worth.”\n\n\n As I explain, Mark retrieves a small cloth bag, then steps forward in front of Benno. With a jingle, he spreads the contents of the bag over the desk.\n\n\n “Then, perhaps I should first show you the different kinds of coins.”\n\n\n There are coins minted out of a light brown metal, perhaps copper, in three different sizes, and there are both small and large coins made out of silver and gold. Lutz, fixated on the gold coins on the table, gulps audibly.\n\n\n “This small copper coin is worth ten leon. The mid-sized one here with the hole in the middle is one hundred leon, and the largest is one thousand. The small silver one is ten thousand, and the pattern continues through this large silver coin, and these small and large gold coins.”\n\n\n Since it’s very easy to remember that ten of a small coin is exchanged for one of a large coin, I’m much more at ease, nodding my head in comprehension as Mark explains. To my right, however, Lutz moans quietly to himself. It seems that he is completely and utterly confused by higher orders of magnitude.\n\n\n We’re going to study very hard this winter.\n\n\n Once he starts having money of his own, I think he’ll probably learn how to calculate with it, so it’ll probably be all right.\n\n\n Benno takes out the six sheets of prototype paper, then lines them up on the desk.\n\n\n “A full sheet of parchment is worth one small gold coin. A sheet the size we use for contracts is worth one large silver coin. A sheet about this size, then, would be about two small silver coins, I think.\n\n\n A postcard-sized sheet is worth two small silver coins, he says…\n\n\n I knew in theory that paper was expensive, but now that the money is being set out right next to it, I suddenly gain a new appreciation of that fact. Come to think of it, I did hear that a contract-size sheet would have been an entire month’s salary for my father, didn’t I?\n\n\n \"So, this time, let’s use parchment as the basis for figuring out the price of this paper. I’ll pay two small silver for the forin paper, and four small silver for the higher-quality tronbay paper. I’ll take a thirty percent commission from that. Next, you said you’ll be needing a new paper frame, larger than the one you used for this prototype. I’ll go ahead and take the price of that out of the total now. That’ll be another fifty percent.”\n\n\n “Alright,” I reply, nodding. Since we’ve managed to complete our prototype, from now on the cost of any tools and materials will be entirely our responsibility.\n\n\n Benno smiles broadly. “How does a twenty percent share sound, this time? In the future, you’ll be ordering raw materials through the lumberyard, and the market price might go down once more paper starts to circulate, so we might have to revisit this in the future, but…” “This is fine with me,” I say.\n\n\n I nod in agreement, then turn to look at Lutz. He nods as well, with an expression I have no idea how to read.\n\n\n Benno sets a wooden calculator on the desk with a thunk and pushes it towards Lutz.\n\n\n “Lutz,” he says, “that’s three sheets of forin paper and three sheets of tronbay. Alright?”\n\n\n Lutz pushes a few things around on the calculator, inputting the price for three sheets of forin, but after that he pauses, bent finger trembling in the air, and hangs his head in defeat. He can do calculation in one digit, but when the quantities or the varieties increase, he loses all hope.\n\n\n “How about you, Maine?”\n\n\n “Umm, ‘two times three is six and three times four is twelve’, so it’ll be eighteen small silver coins total. Twenty percent of that will be three small silver and six large copper for both Lutz and my share together, so each of us will get one small silver and eight large copper.”\n\n\n I blink a little as Benno stares at me. Behind him, Mark smiles wryly.\n\n\n “That’s correct. That really is amazing, to be able to compute that on the spot without a calculator.”\n\n\n I, however, can’t even use a calculator at all, so this winter I’ll need to be practicing right alongside Lutz. I need to be as familiar with my surroundings as possible.\n\n\n “Next… Lutz, I’ll take the cost of the slate and slate pencils out of your individual portion. That’ll be two large copper coins.”\n\n\n Two coins are pulled from Lutz’s share, and in exchange he receives a slate and a few slate pencils.\n\n\n “Now, you can carry this money with you, but if you’re going to have trouble finding a place to store it, you could instead deposit it at the Merchant’s Guild for safekeeping. Which would you prefer?”\n\n\n It seems that the Merchant’s Guild also functions as some sort of bank. Having a lot of physical cash on hand is somewhat terrifying, and since one day I’d like to be able to buy a book, I’d like to have some sort of savings account.\n\n\n “Please give me the large copper coins. I’ll be giving them to my mother. I’ll leave the silver coin with you, if you could please deposit it for me.”\n\n\n It had been one of my dreams as Urano to show gratitude to my parents by giving them my first real paycheck. It’s okay if I manage to fulfill that dream here instead, right?\n\n\n “Alright. Lutz, what about you?”\n\n\n “I’ll do the same as Maine.”\n\n\n “Alright then.”\n\n\n I receive eight large copper coins, then Benno and I touch our guild cards together. They make a sharp pinging noise, like the plucking of a string, then we take them back. Nothing on the card seems to have changed at all.\n\n\n “Now, you’ll be able to take out your money on the third floor of the merchant’s guild. Eventually, you’re going to need to go there and practice doing that.”\n\n\n “That makes sense,” I reply.\n\n\n Benno smiles wryly at me as I stare at the card in my hands, spinning it around in my fingers. Mark seems to share similar thoughts. Lutz touches his card to Benno’s as well, then collects six coins. The feel of the cold metal in our hands sets our hearts racing.\n\n\n “This… is the first time I’ve ever held money,” I whisper.\n\n\n “We’ve earned this ourselves, you know?”\n\n\n I think back on all of the many failures we faced before we successfully made paper. Seeing this money after all of that is moving me deeply.\n\n\n “When spring comes, let’s make a lot of paper, and let’s sell it all,” I say.\n\n\n “Yeah!” replies Lutz.\n\n\n My mind still fixated on my first ever earnings and feeling completely satisfied with the afternoon’s events, I look up at Benno.\n\n\n “This is everything we needed to do today, right?” I ask.\n\n\n However, my words only cause Benno to grimace, and he flicks me on the forehead.\n\n\n “Hey, don’t be stupid, kid. Your battle is tomorrow. You’re going to be facing off against that old bastard’s granddaughter, alone, with no adults there, you know? With that thoughtless look on your face?!”\n\n\n “What?! But, um, she’s just a child, and we’re both girls, right?”\n\n\n I can’t imagine this being anything you’d call a battle. All I’m going to do is meet Freida so that I can ask her what she wants, and the guild leader isn’t going to be there, so is “facing off” really the right phrase to use?\n\n\n “According to the rumors, it sounds like the granddaughter that old bastard really dotes on is the one kid amongst all his grandkids who’s the most like him.”\n\n\n “Sh… she takes after the guild leader?”\n\n\n I try to imagine what the guild leader’s face would look like on a young girl, but my imagination fails me.\n\n\n “Well, you’re bringing Lutz with you, so that’s a little better. You won’t get overwhelmed. Lutz, you shouldn’t say anything you don’t need to, but if that girl tries to steal Maine like the guild leader did earlier today, you need to immediately refuse. Personally, I have no idea where that old bastard’s hidden his traps. Got that?”\n\n\n “Got it.”\n\n\n Lutz nodes vigorously, an earnestly serious expression on his face. Is it really necessary to make this big of a deal out of this meeting, though? We’re talking about an unbaptized little girl, right?\n\n\n As I lean my head to one side doubtfully, the coins audibly rub together in my hand.\n\n\n “…Come to think of it,” I say, “how much did you agree on for Freida’s hairpin? The guild leader made some sort of sign with his fingers, but I didn’t know how to read it…”\n\n\n “The sign that old man put up meant three small silver coins. When I said we needed to ask for a little more, that made it four coins.”\n\n\n This is extremely startling to hear. Even factoring in the price of the thread, this is massively overcharging for just a single hairpin.\n\n\n “Th… what? What?! That’s a ripoff!”\n\n\n “Make sure you’re done on time. This winter’s baptismal ceremony is going to be a great advertisement, so that’ll affect how well we can sell them afterward.”\n\n\n “Um, so, adjusting the price is…”\n\n\n With a sharp glare, Benno banishes my last glimmer of hope.\n\n\n “You think I’m pulling one over on that geezer?”\n\n\n “No, not at all.”\n\n\n I hang my head dejectedly as I reply. I’m going to have to make a pin that’s worth four small silver coins, so there’s more than just a little bit of pressure on me.\n\n\n “Even after my introduction fee, my commission, and the materials cost, you’re still going to make, what, fifty, sixty percent of that? Put your heart into this, kids. It’ll be fine! Look, that old bastard finally managed to find the hairpin he was looking so hard for, but you wouldn’t sell the one you were holding right in front of him. That makes it seem even harder to get, right? Then, he’s asking that you do something that you’d ordinarily be doing as your winter handiwork right now, in the middle of this amazingly busy time of year when everyone’s trying to prepare for winter, and sell it to him by this winter’s baptismal ceremony, before it’s even gone to market, so his granddaughter can wear something nobody else is? That’s what that price means. Don’t worry about it, kid.”\n\n\n So, if you can come up with a few excuses, it’s okay to blatantly rip someone off, he’s saying? Seriously, give me a break."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The next day, before the third bell has chimed, Lutz and I wait in the central plaza for Freida to arrive. Now that I think about it, though, I actually haven’t heard at all about Freida’s hair color, mannerisms, eye color, or anything else of that nature.\n\n\n “What do we do, Lutz?”\n\n\n “She’s going to wave to us when she gets here, probably?”\n\n\n “…I wonder if she’ll recognize us?”\n\n\n “She will. Your hairpin is super unique, and plus her grandfather is right in there so if she goes to ask him, she’ll be able to pick us out right away, right?”\n\n\n Lutz, shrugging, points to the Merchant’s Guild building that overlooks the central plaza. As he says, Freida could probably identify us immediately.\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz. How did it go at your place yesterday? My folks were…”\n\n\n Yesterday, Lutz and I sold our paper to Benno, then returned home with our first earnings. At my house, my entire family’s eyes all went wide upon seeing the money, and when I told them the story about how Lutz and I had worked to make paper, they praised me, saying things like “amazing!” and “you must have worked hard!”. Then, after I added my first-ever pay to our living budget, we bought a fair amount of a precious luxury item during the winter preparation days: honey.\n\n\n “How about you, Lutz? Are they happier with you becoming a trader now?”\n\n\n Lutz, working with me, successfully finished our-making project, and was accepted by Benno to be an apprentice as his shop. What, though, would his family think, I wonder? Would they approve of his enthusiasm?\n\n\n Lutz shrugs, smiling bitterly. “It went… questionably. They were overjoyed about the money, but they’re still not sold on the idea of me being a merchant. My dad was all, ‘you said you made paper with Maine and sold it, so why not be a craftsman and make paper?’ He’d said he’d happier if I was just a craftsman.”\n\n\n “Your dad really wants you to be a craftsman, huh.”\n\n\n I understand how someone can take great pride in making things for a living, but Lutz’s dreams are very different. It’s hard to find a middle ground.\n\n\n “But I don’t want to be a craftsman. I want to be a merchant like Benno, able to leave the city. Maine, you didn’t just want to make paper, right?”\n\n\n “Right. My next step is to figure out how to mass-produce it. Then, I want hand off the actual production duties to someone else and work towards making books. If there aren’t more books in the world, I can’t own a bookstore, and my dream of being a librarian is always going to be a dream.”\n\n\n If I want books to proliferate, then just mass-producing paper isn’t going to be enough. A printing technique is also absolutely necessary. I can’t let myself be satisfied with books made out of loose stacks of memo paper.\n\n\n …The road ahead is still very long.\n\n\n “If I could run a bookstore with you, Maine, that would be great! Yesterday, when I saw those bookshelves at the Merchant’s Guild, I started thinking, who’s going to want books? People who can read, so rich people, right?”\n\n\n “Yeah, I guess you’re right.”\n\n\n The commoners in this town can’t really read, so of course there’s no way they’re going to want to buy books. 'Books? What’re those? They tasty?’ they’d say.\n\n\n “So, if we’re selling books, then we’re going to want to go and sell them to the nobility of a lot of different towns, right? Like maybe the lord of the next town over, like we saw on the map.”\n\n\n When I consider the types of customers that might be buying books, he’s making a fair amount of sense.\n\n\n As I idly admire Lutz for how he solidified his own goals while silently staring at that map, I hear the patter of small footsteps coming up to me and stopping.\n\n\n “Pardon me, but are you Maine?”\n\n\n “Um?! Uh, yes!! I’m Maine. You must be Freida?”\n\n\n “That’s right!” she says, beaming. “Pleased to meet you.”\n\n\n Her cherry-blossom hair is done up in pigtails, and her light brown eyes show a hint of a gentle smile; a sweet and adorable little girl. I don’t know if it’s because of good breeding or very rigorous home discipline, but her actions and manner of speech are more grown-up than I was expecting, in contrast to how small she is for her age. I can’t say much about the person herself, but she gives off an unbalanced first impression.\n\n\n However, no matter how hard I look, I can’t see a trace of the guild leader in her. Maybe it was just a rumor that she resembles her grandfather the guild master? I’m glad Benno was worried for nothing.\n\n\n She looks over at Lutz. “Are you Maine’s friend? I was looking forward to it just being us girls…” Her cheeks puff out in just a hint of a pout.\n\n\n Certainly, talking with another girl my age does have some appeal, but that’s usually restricted to only when the other girl is a close friend. Today, our destination if the guild leader’s house. I have no desire at all to go there by myself.\n\n\n In response, I immediately grab on to Lutz’s hand, smiling at him.\n\n\n “I’m not really strong, and I faint a lot, so if I don’t have Lutz here with me I can’t really go outside. Even if I go to Mister Benno’s shop, if Lutz doesn’t come with me, they won’t let me in. So, if Lutz can’t come today…”\n\n\n Before I can get the words 'I’ll have to go home’ out of my mouth, Frieda suddenly bursts into a question.\n\n\n “It’s dangerous if nobody’s watching you, and you faint a lot… Maine, do you perhaps have… the devouring?”\n\n\n “Huh? …Devouring?”\n\n\n Unconsciously, I tip my head to the side, hearing this unfamiliar term. Frieda has her head tilted in the opposite direction, her hands held lightly to her cheeks.\n\n\n “Do you not know the word? …How do I say this, is there something hot deep inside you that moves around against your will?”\n\n\n “There is!! That sickness, do you know about it?!”\n\n\n Information about this disease, which nobody so far has known anything about, has suddenly appeared from a completely unexpected source. Both Lutz and I lean forward eagerly, waiting for her reply, but she gives a slightly troubled smile.\n\n\n “…I had it as well. That’s why my body is still so small, you see?”\n\n\n It seems like both my small stature and the fact that I collapse if I lose lose focus even slightly are caused by this “devouring” illness. When I compare myself to Freida, who also looks like she could be two or three years younger than she really is, I’m suddenly taken aback.\n\n\n “Is… is there a cure?!”\n\n\n She just used the past tense. In other words. She’s cured. After I briefly exchanged a glance with Lutz, the question leapt hungrily out of my mouth. Freida lowers her eyebrows apologetically and answers in a low, sighing voice.\n\n\n “…It’s expensive. Really expensive.”\n\n\n “Whoa, it’s hopeless, then…”\n\n\n For the granddaughter of a successful merchant who serves as the leader of a guild to say something is “really expensive”, then there isn’t the slightest hope that my family will be able to purchase it. I hang my head low, dejectedly, and Freida pats me gently on the shoulder.\n\n\n “But you seem so healthy, Maine! As long as you keep your eye set on a goal and work towards it with all your might, you’ll be fine. Be careful, though, because if your will falters or you lose sight of your goal, then you’ll face the backlash.”\n\n\n I see. It’s because I had my mind set first on going to the forest, and then now on making paper, that I’ve been so healthy lately? When I gave up on my last objective I did come close to death, huh.\n\n\n Huh? Isn’t this like those migratory fish that literally die if they stop swimming?\n\n\n I groan quietly to myself as I carefully file this new information away inside my head. My sickness is called the devouring. Today, I finally learned its name. Also, I learned a method to manage it. In order to stay healthy, I need to be constantly moving towards a goal.\n\n\n “If you have no more questions, shall we head to my house?”\n\n\n “Sure,” I reply.\n\n\n The house that Freida leads us to has a shop on its ground floor, much like others in the area. It’s considerably large, and far closer to the castle walls than Benno’s is. In fact, it might not even be accurate to describe the building as “close” to the walls. It is right next to them, and has the best view of the temple that one could possibly get.\n\n\n “I really love watching the parade to the baptismal ceremonies, you know, and I watch them every single time. During this summer’s parade, I saw that hairpin. It stood out so much for me.”\n\n\n If her house is here, then she’d be able to have an excellent view of the entire procession as it enters the temple without even having to leave her front door.\n\n\n “Since it was the first time I’d seen anything like it, I asked my grandfather if he had any information about it, but he wasn’t able to find anything out about it. Then, in the fall ceremony, when I saw that they hadn’t spread around, I thought it was very mysterious…”\n\n\n “These do require some time to make,” I say, “so unfortunately I really can’t make them unless it’s the middle of the winter, when I have a lot of time on my hands.”\n\n\n Or so my mother insists, I add, in my head.\n\n\n “Is that what happened…”\n\n\n “If I can sell them, then you should be able to see many girls wearing ornaments like these come next spring’s ceremonies.”\n\n\n “Well! So, that means that I’ll be the only girl wearing one this winter, right? I’m looking forward to this!”\n\n\n When I see her face light up, I remember how Benno had said “sell it as a special service by the winter’s baptismal ceremony, before it’s even gone to market, so his granddaughter can wear something nobody else is.” I see now that this would be like a special premium product.\n\n\n It may be premium, but still, is it okay to rip them off like this? I’d really prefer not…\n\n\n The building that Freida’s home and her grandfather’s shop is in seems to have been rented out entirely to the store’s employees. Not a single person who doesn’t have any connection to the store lives in this building, it seems.\n\n\n When we reach her home, on the second floor of the building, I suddenly stop dead in my tracks, stunned.\n\n\n There’s so much cloth in this room. I thought the same thing when I had visited Otto’s house before, but that was only when I was in his parlor. However, no matter where I look in Freida’s house, I see tapestries and cushions in a brilliant display of overflowing color. Also, on the shelves, there are stone figures of animals and metal sculptures. It is very obvious that this is the home of an exceptionally rich family, one with the political clout to live so close to the nobility.\n\n\n “Refreshments, young lady?”\n\n\n After being brought to the drawing room, the woman working as a servant here brings something to drink. This red liquid is served not in the wooden cups I’m used to seeing, but in metal ones.\n\n\n “Ah, thank you,” Freida replies. “This,” she says to me, “is a beverage made by adding water to a syrup made by adding water to colde juice. It is very sweet!”\n\n\n Colde berries are very much like raspberries, so I perhaps this is something like raspberry juice. As I ponder, I raise the cup to my lips, and find that it’s much sweeter than I expected. It’s so rare for me to taste sweet things, and I belatedly realize that my careful expression has disintegrated into a genuine smile.\n\n\n “So sweet! Lutz, this is delicious!”\n\n\n “It really is! Sweet and tasty!”\n\n\n “I’m so glad you enjoy it! …Now then, to what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?”\n\n\n Freida tilts her head very slightly to the side as she asks her question, and I wonder just what the guild leader actually told her. Since I have no way to actually tell, perhaps giving her a full explanation myself would be the best idea?\n\n\n “To be frank, yesterday, your grandfather commissioned me to make you a hair ornament that you could wear to your baptismal ceremony.”\n\n\n I take Tory’s hairpin, which I’d brought as an example, from my tote bag. Freida glances at it, then nods slightly.\n\n\n “That much I had heard. However, I’d have expected my grandfather to just arbitrarily decide on something like that without any input, though.”\n\n\n As expected of a grandchild. She is absolutely correct. Her grandfather had been running wild and ordered this hairpin entirely on his own, intending for it to be a total surprise.\n\n\n “Ummm… he did say something to that extent, but I personally thought that you’d be far happier with a hairpin that was not only your favorite color but also matched your clothing as well, so I asked him if I could meet with you to discuss what you would truly want.”\n\n\n Freida’s hair is the color of cherry blossoms. In other words, it’s a light pink. A hair ornament that was made to match Tory’s blue-green hair would absolutely not fit her hair color. An image starts to form in my mind; perhaps reddish flowers, or maybe even white ones, set in contrast to green leaves to pull everything together.\n\n\n “Ah, I thought that was a little too unusually thoughtful for my grandfather, but it seems you were the one who reined him in?”\n\n\n “Anyhow, if it’s alright with you, could you please show me the clothing that you’re going to wear to the ceremony? I’d like to look at the colors that were used in the embroidery.”\n\n\n I had intended to dodge that particular topic and turn the conversation away from the subject of the guild leader, but Freida, perceiving this, chuckles softly to herself.\n\n\n …Are all the children who have had such high-class training so mature?\n\n\n Both her actions and her manner of speaking are maybe even more adult than mine. At the very least, she’s a very different person from the other kids that I go to the forest with.\n\n\n “Wait just a minute,” she says. “I’ll go get my dress for you.”\n\n\n As Freida leaves her seat, Lutz lets out an unnecessarily over-exaggerated sigh. He rolls his shoulders and shakes his head from side to side, limbering up his body as if staring silently had been a tremendously difficult task.\n\n\n “Are you doing okay, Lutz?”\n\n\n “I couldn’t really join in the conversation. I dunno anything about how clothes and colors match up, and I can’t really make myself talk that fancy, you know.”\n\n\n When Freida and I were talking, I’d unintentionally started talking in a much more polite manner. Since I had also been very concerned about accidentally saying something out of place, I nod emphatically in agreement.\n\n\n “Yeah. When you start working, you’re going to need to know how to talk fancy like that, but you can let me do that talking today when we’re asking her what she wants. Staying totally silent like that is probably really hard, but I’d be very worried if I didn’t have you here, so please stay with me!”\n\n\n “Yeah!”\n\n\n Just having a friend nearby is reassuring. Just as I breathe out sigh of relief, Freida returns.\n\n\n “I’m sorry to keep you waiting. This is the dress I’ll be wearing.”\n\n\n “Whoa, amazing!”\n\n\n Freida has brought out the dress that she’s planning on wearing to her baptismal ceremony. Like Tory’s, white serves as the foundation for the garment, but unlike Tory’s, the material is far thicker. To be specific, Freida’s dress has parts of it that are fluffy, like fur, and it looks very warm.\n\n\n Suddenly reminded of the countless, countless layers I have to wear during the winter, puffing me up like a ball, I groan quietly to myself. During the summer ceremonies, everyone wears thin fabrics, so what’s important isn’t just the money you have to spend, but also the skill with which the garment is put together. For the winter ceremonies, though, one’s purchasing power makes a much bigger difference, it seems.\n\n\n “Freida, do you like this color?”\n\n\n “I do. That’s why I had my dress embroidered in it, you know?”\n\n\n Having discovered embroidery done in a reddish thread amongst the white of her dress, I compare it to the color of her hair. If I use this color, I should be able to match both her dress and her hair.\n\n\n “Do you by any chance have any of this embroidery thread left over?” I ask.\n\n\n “I do, I think; what do you need it for?”\n\n\n “I think that, for consistency’s sake, I should make the flowers the same color. May I ask you for a little bit of it? I can try to find a thread that’s the same color.”\n\n\n “Sure, that’s fine with me.”\n\n\n I’ll get a small piece of thread from her, then ask Benno to find me more thread that matches that color. Since Benno has already negotiated a ludicrously high price, I think I can afford to be picky about the thread being used.\n\n\n “Will this be enough, I wonder?”\n\n\n Freida returns with a ball of thread so large that she could probably have her dress fully embroidered a second time.\n\n\n “That’s… certainly enough, but…”\n\n\n “Then, I’ll leave it in your capable hands.”\n\n\n She places the bundle of deep red thread in my arms, leaving me at a loss for words.\n\n\n If she’s giving me all of the raw materials, then we’re really overcharging her! What should I do now?!\n\n\n Although, I can’t really say anything like “since the price Benno quoted included sourcing the raw materials, I’ll give you a discount.” The relationship between Benno and the guild leader he’s overcharging is complicated enough, which is troubling. Plus, in my head, I can hear him admonishing me, saying “whenever and wherever you can take money, just take it, it’s something to be taken.”\n\n\n Groaning softly to myself, I take another look at Freida’s hairstyle.\n\n\n “How were you planning on styling your hair on the day of the ceremony?” I ask.\n\n\n “Just like it is now, I think…?”\n\n\n Since Freida has her hair in pigtails, she’ll need two hairpins. I’m glad I thought to ask. Better yet, I’m glad I stopped the guild leader from being too rash. If I’d done as he’d asked, not only would the hairpin not suit her, but she’d only have a pin for one side of her hair, which would have been problematic indeed.\n\n\n “…If you’ll be wearing it like you are today, you’ll need two hairpins, won’t you?”\n\n\n “…Ah. You’re right.”\n\n\n Freida seems just as taken aback as I am. I’m slightly relieved though; if I have to make two hairpins, then this will be somewhat less of a huge rip-off. Freida thoughtfully taps on her chin, a slightly serious expression on her face.\n\n\n “I’m going to have to pay double for this, I think.”\n\n\n “No, no, since you’ve given me the thread I’ll need for the materials, the existing payment is very much fine with me.”\n\n\n Since the production cost has been driven down to basically nothing, there is literally no way I could possibly accept double the excessive amount that we’re already charging. The thought of it hurts my stomach.\n\n\n “No, but you can’t possibly say that,” she replies. “You agreed to make one hairpin for that amount of money. If you make two, then I’ll pay you for two.”\n\n\n “I couldn’t! You’re providing the raw materials, so for two…”\n\n\n As Freida and I start to endlessly dither back and forth, with her insisting she’ll pay and me insisting she doesn’t have to, Lutz, who has been quiet this whole time, suddenly reaches up to noisily scratch his head.\n\n\n “So,” he proposes, “how about charging half-price for the second one?”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n “Maine, since you got the materials, you want to give a discount. Freida, since you don’t want to cause any trouble between Benno and the guild leader, you want to pay full price for two. How about you meet in the middle, and pay half?”\n\n\n “Lutz, you’re a genius!” I exclaim. “Freida, how does that sound?”\n\n\n I jump on Lutz’s proposed compromise, to which I can’t find any objections. I eagerly turn to look at Freida, but her incomprehensible expression doesn’t seem to tell me that she’s satisfied with that.\n\n\n “I’m… fine with that, I guess, but… whenever and wherever you can earn money, you should take it, right? It’s something that’s there to be taken.”\n\n\n This girl has just spouted words that do not at all match her sweet and adorable appearance. Freida is, without a doubt, a merchant’s daughter, and the grandchild of the guild leader.\n\n\n “…Is that a merchant’s wisdom?” I ask. “Benno said the same thing…”\n\n\n “Hm?” she says, looking slightly doubtful. “Isn’t that just how commerce works?”\n\n\n Although she talks as if she’s saying the most obvious thing in the world, I can’t help but shake my head.\n\n\n “There are limits to that, like, there are fair prices for things, and… ah, well, I’m just happy we found a compromise.”\n\n\n “The two are pretty unusual!” she says, smiling slightly. This, however, is no hidden sneer, but a friendly, genuine smile.\n\n\n We certainly haven’t formed a bond through resolving this disagreement, but I think we’ve worked a little bit to clear the space between us. It feels like there’s a little bit of solidarity, here.\n\n\n This wasn’t exactly a negotiation to be proud of, but all of the details of the hairpins have been worked out. I’d thought that we’d immediately head home after that, but by now refills for our colde juice have arrived, and Lutz’s eyes, which had been full of silent desire to immediately leave, are now firmly glued to his cup. I myself also want to stay a little while long and savor this sweet flavor, so we spend a bit of time chatting idly.\n\n\n “Ah, so you go to the forest to pick fruits and gather firewood. That sounds like you’re going on a picnic every day!”\n\n\n Gathering firewood is pretty essential to maintaining our lifestyles, so it’s actually not as leisurely of an activity as she’s making it out to be. Rather, I’m actually more interested in how Freida lives, since she has no need to go out to the forest in order to forage for firewood.\n\n\n “Freida, what do you usually do during the day? Kids in this part of the town don’t go to the forest, do they?”\n\n\n “Oh, what I like to do is… heh heh…\"\n\n\n In a single beat, Freida starts smiling broadly.\n\n\n \"Counting money, I’d say?”\n\n\n Huh? Did I mishear? Was that my imagination? Did my ears go funny for a second? I can’t imagine that a thought like that would have come out of this sweet, adorable little girl’s mouth.\n\n\n “Ah, that’s not quite right. My apologies.”\n\n\n I’m taken aback by that unexpectedly strange answer, but Freida gently shakes her head and moves to revise her earlier statement. She just misspoke, it seems, I think to myself, putting a relieved hand on my chest. But only for a moment.\n\n\n “It’s not just counting it, I like saving it. Feeling the heavy weight of a sack full of gold is so delightful, and hearing coins clink against each other is the most wonderful thing! Don’t you agree?”\n\n\n “…Ah… yes… that might be right. I also like it when my savings box starts to get heavy.”\n\n\n After squeezing those words out, I quietly close my eyes.\n\n\n …That wasn’t a hallucination. Now who’s making stuff up about her hobbies? Me! I am! I’m an enormous idiot! She’s the kind of girl who looks like she should be into making candy or embroidering things, so for her hobby to be money… I hadn’t even the slightest clue.\n\n\n “Ah! You know what I mean?!”\n\n\n Perhaps because someone agreed with her opinion, or perhaps because she just loves money that much, she starts getting fired up.\n\n\n “So, when I was very young, the thing I loved the most was the glittering of gold coins, so when my grandfather did his monthly accounting, I sat with him, and I really enjoyed helping him count his gold.”\n\n\n Did she just skip entirely over copper and silver, and go straight to gold? This damn rich girl!\n\n\n Even as I grow increasingly envious, Freida keeps passionately rambling on. She gets entranced by gold, she says excitedly, to the point that her eyes grow foggy and her cheeks grow hot, etc., etc., and she things that financial calculations and growing a business looks very fun.\n\n\n “And, lately, I’ve been thinking about what I can do to start making more money, so when I find new products that I might be able to sell my heart starts jumping with joy!”\n\n\n …What do I do? This girl is strange. She’s cute, but far too unfortunate.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine.”\n\n\n “Y-yes, what is it?”\n\n\n By this point, about half of my consciousness has wandered entirely elsewhere, so when she addresses I suddenly sit straight back up, snapping back to attention. Freida’s eyes are glittering brightly, and at the same time she grabs my hands tightly.\n\n\n “I’m really pleased with you, you know.”\n\n\n “Thank you very much?”\n\n\n My voice unconsciously pitches unnaturally up at the end of my statement. I have no clue whatsoever about why she could possibly be pleased with me. As I tilt my head doubtfully to the side, Freida draws unabashedly close, a blush crossing her adorably sweet face as she continues to speak.\n\n\n “Maine, do you want to work with me?”\n\n\n “She can’t!” replies Lutz immediately, before I can even react.\n\n\n “Oh my! Well, my family’s shop is much larger than Benno’s, and we’ve been selling things for a lot longer than he has, so this is a good deal for her, isn’t it? So, since there’s no way you’re officially employed as apprentices since you still haven’t been baptized yet, so she can still come do her apprenticeship at my family’s shop! Also, I’m asking Maine. That question wasn’t directed at you at all.”\n\n\n Huh? Didn’t something like this happen… yesterday…?\n\n\n “I’m thankful for the offer,” I say, “but I owe a lot to Mister Benno…”\n\n\n Before I can finish my sentence with “so I must refuse”, Freida suddenly smiles even more widely, interrupting me.\n\n\n “Aha! If that’s the case, then I’ll pay him back for you.”\n\n\n “Um?! W, well…”\n\n\n I’m trying to refuse, but she’s not letting me. Those weren’t just rumors. Benno wasn’t just overexaggerating his fears.\n\n\n She is exactly like the guild leader! Her manner of speaking might be a little different, but she is saying the exact same things!\n\n\n Her smile not fading in the slightest, she starts rambling off all of the benefits of working at her family’s shop. Lutz is suddenly looking very unhappy.\n\n\n “Maine, answer her clearly, like you did yesterday.”\n\n\n “I, I, I must refuse!!”\n\n\n Ordinarily, I’d think that being rejected so clearly would cause a child to start crying, but Freida’s eyes merely go wide for a brief moment. Then, her fighting spirit reignites, and her eyes gleam brightly again.\n\n\n “Well then, that’s a shame. …But! There’s still some time before your baptismal ceremony, Maine, and since you’re temporarily registered with the Merchant’s Guild already, I’m sure there will be plenty of opportunities for me to run into you until then. Heh heh heh, I’m looking forward to this!”\n\n\n What now? I feel like I’m a rat cornered by a snake, with no place to escape, and a cold sweat breaks out over my forehead.\n\n\n Benno! I don’t care how much you overcharge anymore, just please, save meee!"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Lutz and I leave Freida’s house, commencing our journey home. She just saw us off with a smile, but why do I feel like I’m fleeing for my life? All we did was eat sweets and chat a little, but why am I more exhausted than when I go to the forest?\n\n\n “Ah, have you finished your negotitions?”\n\n\n “Mister Mark?”\n\n\n As we pass Benno’s shop on our way home, Mark calls out to us. We’d previously been told that we should come by the shop tomorrow afternoon to deliver our report, so we were planning on heading home for the day, but Mark waves to us, smilingly beckoning us inside.\n\n\n “I know that we had planned to discuss this tomorrow,” he says, “but since Master Benno is rather nervous at the moment, would you perhaps be willing to discuss the outcome of today’s negotiations right now?”\n\n\n “…Yes, I would.”\n\n\n My stomach churns a little as I think about how much I might get scolded for arbitrarily charging half price for a second pin, but I do really want to finish this as quickly as possible.\n\n\n “Master Benno,” says Mark, opening the door. “May Maine and Lutz enter?”\n\n\n “Yeah, show them in.”\n\n\n Benno sits behind his desk, tapping his finger impatiently on its surface as if to tell us to get in there immediately.\n\n\n “…Maine, what’d you think? Of that old man’s granddaughter.”\n\n\n “Ummm, she seemed like very cute young lady, like the rumors said.”\n\n\n “Alright, so she’s well-groomed. What did you think?”\n\n\n I tried hard to be politely indirect about my description, but Benno waves his hand dismissively, telling me to get to the heart of the matter.\n\n\n “To be honest,” I reply, “her appearance and her personality are so different that I was a little shocked. She’s not just a girl who loves money, though; she’s been close to the guild leader, observing him, since well before her baptism. She’s thinking about how to grow her capital, how to expand her business ventures, and so on. I think she has amazing talent for being a merchant.”\n\n\n “You think she’s amazing, hmm…”\n\n\n Benno roughly scratches his head, then breathes a heavy sigh.\n\n\n “Umm,” I say, “how should I put this… she’s cute, but very… strange. Right, Lutz?”\n\n\n When I cram all those thoughts about my impression of her into that one sentence, Lutz raises his eyebrows, then looks down at me with a face that screams “like you’re one to talk.” Benno, looking very interested, quirks up the edges of his mouth, then asks Lutz the same question.\n\n\n “Lutz, what did you think?”\n\n\n “She tried to recruit Maine just like the guild leader did yesterday, so I think that she’s not someone you can let your guard down around. Also, I think that… she’s kinda like Maine.”\n\n\n “Whaaat?! How?!”\n\n\n That’s way too unthinkable!\n\n\n As I practically lunge forward, demanding an explanation for his shocking words, Lutz merely shrugs his shoulders.\n\n\n “When that girl talked about money,” he says, “she looked like you do when you’re talking about books. Both of you act like you don’t have eyes for anything other than the thing you like, so it’s just like you said earlier: cute face, but weird inside.”\n\n\n Ah, I see. Right now, apparently, I look pretty cute.\n\n\n There are no mirrors in my house, so I had tried to look at my reflection in a bucket of water, but all I could see was a warped, blurry shadow. The only people who have called me cute to my face were either people I’ve only just met or my excessively doting father, so I thought it was just polite flattery.\n\n\n For as long as I can remember, I’ve been used to people calling me not just your average bookworm, but a weirdo. It doesn’t really matter much to me, but I wasn’t particularly cute at all. If you had looked at me, you’d have seen just the kind of nerdy girl who holed herself up in the library all the time. Nobody had ever said that I looked any different than they thought I should.\n\n\n I imagine a girl who resembles her siblings, so one who looks like a younger version of Tory, who also chases after nonexistent books, so an eccentric, strangely-behaving one. As I think about that dramatic clash of images, I hang my head in defeat.\n\n\n “…I’m sorry. I have something to think about now.”\n\n\n “Think long and hard about it.”\n\n\n “Ngh…” I say, depressed.\n\n\n Benno, who has been watching our exchange with a smirk, starts tapping his finger on his desk again.\n\n\n “Then what? Did you finish your negotiations?”\n\n\n “Umm, Miss Freida wears her hair in two braids, so it turns out that I’ll be making two hairpins.”\n\n\n “Hmm! So we’ll make double the profit.”\n\n\n My heart skips a beat when he says that. There’s no way I can’t tell him about this, but if I tell him, he’ll absolutely get mad at me.\n\n\n “Well, umm, you see…”\n\n\n “What?”\n\n\n Benno stares pointedly at me with his reddish-brown eyes. My breath catches in my throat with a squeak, and I stammer, stalling for time, as I try to come up with some kind of explanations. Benno turns his sharp gaze from me to Lutz. The instant Benno opens his mouth, Lutz starts talking.\n\n\n “Miss Freida provided Maine with the thread that she’ll be using for the raw materials, so Maine said that she’d make the second one for no extra charge…”\n\n\n “Lutz?!” I cry, panicked.\n\n\n “What did you say?!” roars Benno, at the exact same instant.\n\n\n “Miss Freida,” continued Lutz, “insisted that the price had already been established, so she’d pay full price for the second one…”\n\n\n “…Oh?”\n\n\n “It didn’t seem like they’d ever agree on anything, so I spoke up, and we came to an agreement that Miss Freida would pay half price for the second hairpin.”\n\n\n After Lutz delivers his precise, succinct report, Benno raises his eyebrows, then turns to look at me.\n\n\n “Maine… are you an idiot? Have you heard a word I’ve said? Or did you just forget everything?”\n\n\n “I… I remembered! So even when I got the materials, I didn’t try to lower the price at all for the first one. But then, after we agreed on half-price for the second, Freida said ‘whenever and wherever you can take money you should take it, because it’s something that’s there to be taken’, like you do.”\n\n\n “The person you were negotiating with told you that?”\n\n\n Benno rubs his forehead, an amazed look on his face, then shakes his head. Even I had thought it was kind of pitiful that my opponent would remind me of that, but the thought of overcharging her that much made my stomach churn.\n\n\n “But I was thinking that maybe there’s a limit to how much I should be profiting, or maybe I was way past asking for a fair price, so my stomach started hurting… please forgive me.”\n\n\n “What kind of merchant gets a stomachache when earning money? Seriously… Well, that’s just money out of your pocket. I’m charging the same handling fee for both of them, so I don’t care either way. If strange rumors start to spread about how you can get a second hairpin for free if you buy one, then you’re definitely going to get pushy customers coming in to demand it. Make sure you pay attention to what customers you can afford to lose.”\n\n\n I hadn’t realized that customers like that could possibly exist. I hang my head even lower, the awareness of my lack of basic knowledge being hammered like nails into my skull.\n\n\n “Ngh, I hadn’t thought that far ahead. I’m sorry. Then, here is the thread that Freida lent me to use as materials. I’m going to want some white thread that matches this one. I’m going to need, ummm…”\n\n\n I pull the measuring tape out of my tote bag, then stretch it from fingertip to fingertip.\n\n\n “About this long… I’ll need a piece that’s about 100 feli long, please.”\n\n\n “Got it. Tomorrow, come back here so that you can go to the thread warehouse with Mark. While you’re at it, you should pick up the thread you’ll need for your winter work.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir,” I reply.\n\n\n After we’re told that it’s okay to leave, Lutz and I head out from Benno’s shop to return home. I suddenly sympathize dearly with all of the worn-out salarymen back home. I want to go home and be comforted.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “I’m home,” I say, as I walk through the door.\n\n\n “Welcome back, Maine,” says Tory. “How was the girl you met today? Did you make friends?”\n\n\n She, on cooking duty for today, looks up from the pot she’s stirring and smiles at me. She has a cute face, she’s very helpful, she’s kind, she’s been getting better at cooking so she’s a (future) excellent cook, and since she’s working as a seamstress she’s a (future) sewing beauty. When I see her, emotion suddenly wells up in my heart.\n\n\n “Toryyy~!” I cry, running up and clinging to her tightly.\n\n\n She looks down at me, frowning a little. “What’s wrong, Maine, did something happen?”\n\n\n “Tory, you’re an angel! You heal me. You’re the best older sister in the world, but I’m not even just sick and useless all the time. Lutz told me today that I’m way weirder than I look, so I only just noticed. I’m so sorry, Tory!”\n\n\n “Hah…” she sighs, stroking my head. “You just noticed?”\n\n\n After a little while, she points over to the bedroom. “Maine, I can’t cook like this. Go put your stuff away, okay?”\n\n\n “Okay!”\n\n\n I put my tote bag away, then come back to help Tory in the kitchen. Even though people keep saying over and over that I’m so small, I have grown a little bit, so now I can actually stir a pot safely, if I’m standing on a chair.\n\n\n While I carefully stir the pot so that nothing burns, I tell Tory all about my day.\n\n\n “Okay, so, the girl I met is called Freida, and she’s really cute, but her hobby is money. She said her favorite thing to do is count gold coins.”\n\n\n “Gold coins?! I haven’t even seen those! She must be super rich to have enough of those to count.”\n\n\n Tory seems to have jumped straight to the quantity of gold coins, missing Freida’s weird interests entirely. Around here, I think it might not be uncommon for someone to spend their entire life without seeing a single gold coin, so I know just how big of an impact that might have.\n\n\n “Her house is amazing too. There’s decorations and cloth everywhere, and it’s very pretty. Oh! And then Freida told me that the sickness I have is called the devouring.”\n\n\n “…Huh, I’ve never heard of that.”\n\n\n Tory tilts her head to the side doubtfully when she hears about that previously-unknown disease. It can’t be helped; it seems like there’s very few people who actually know about it, after all.\n\n\n “It’s a really rare disease. Mister Otto and Mister Benno even said that they didn’t know about it. She knew about it because she used to have it too! But she also said that it took a lot of money to cure her. And if a girl that rich says that it took a lot of money…”\n\n\n “…then there’s no way we can afford it.”\n\n\n Tory immediately comes to the same conclusion that I had. She didn’t even need to think about it. With our economic status, where we can’t even call a doctor when someone collapses with a fever, there’s no way we can make that happen, no matter what we do.\n\n\n “…Yeah. But she told me about what I can do to make sure it doesn’t get any worse!”\n\n\n “Oh?”\n\n\n “If I have a goal or a target in mind, and I’m always working really hard on making it there, then I’ll be fine, she says.”\n\n\n “Ah! That makes sense. You’ve been kinda doing whatever you like lately, so you’ve been much healthier. Before, you always used to cry about how only I could do things that I liked…”\n\n\n “Ooh…”\n\n\n Now that she mentions it, Maine’s memories are full of times when she was feverish, crying a lot, and bothering Tory. Now that she’s made that comparison to the past out loud, though, I think she had to have noticed something strange had happened, right?\n\n\n As I start to brood, Tory hurriedly comes over to stroke my hair comfortingly.\n\n\n “Don’t feel bad. I think it’s great that you’re feeling so much better. So! How about the hairpin?”\n\n\n “I asked her about what her favorite color was, and she gave me some of the thread that her dress is embroidered with. I’m going make the pins out of it. And since she has her hair in two braids, she needs two pins.”\n\n\n “Hmm, I see!”\n\n\n Our mother returns home while we’re still in the middle of our preparations, and after a little while our father, who has recently been stuck only on night shifts and thus I haven’t seen very much, returns from his first day shift in a while. While we eat the first dinner in a while that we’ve had the whole family together for, we talk a lot about the guild leader’s home. It’s not at all common for someone like us to be able to visit the home of someone so rich, so everyone at the table was extremely interested in hearing all about it.\n\n\n My mother seemed most interested in hearing about all of the decorative tapestries and cushions they had, and my father was more interested in the brands of liquor they had lined up on the shelves. Tory was curious about the things that Freida wore and the kinds of things she owned, so her questions were all about Freida’s belongings.\n\n\n After a much more exciting dinner than I thought we’d have, I pull my mother aside and ask her if she could give back my embroidery needles.\n\n\n “What are you going to do?” she asks.\n\n\n “I’m going to make some hairpins. I told you yesterday, right? They’re what Freida wants me to make. Today I went to find out exactly what she wanted to order. I also told her that I wanted to make it out of the same thread that her dress was embroidered with, so she lent me some.”\n\n\n “Could you show me that thread, please?”\n\n\n My mother, the skilled seamstress who works as a dyer, could not, of course, hide her great interest in the thread I’d brought home from Freida. She tells me that she’ll get her sewing kit and take out the embroidery needles, so I should immediately go and fetch the thread.\n\n\n I pull the thread out of my tote bag. The instant I set it on the table, my mother picks it up, staring at it very closely. Tory, who is apprenticing as a seamstress, is also interested in the kind of thread that the daughter of a rich family has embroidered on her dresses, so she excitedly comes in to sneak a peek.\n\n\n “Dying a thread this deeply red takes a lot of work, you know.”\n\n\n “It really is a high quality thread!”\n\n\n While the two of them are entranced by the bundle of thread they hold, I sit down at the table in front of them and get my embroidering needles ready.\n\n\n “Since hairpins like this are super rare, we’re going to sell it at a really high price. So, I’m going to try my hardest on this!”\n\n\n “Is it going to be like mine?” asks Tory.\n\n\n When I was making Tory’s pin, my first priority had been making economical use of the thread we had, so I was only really able to make it out of tiny flowers made out of the colors of thread we had left over. This time, though, I have quite a lot of the red thread that Freida lent me. Also, since we’re charging as much as we are, I’m going to try to make it somewhat more elaborate than Tory’s. For me, I need to put in a good faith effort.\n\n\n “The flowers are going to be bigger,” I say. “since I’ve got so much more thread.”\n\n\n My mental image is a bouquet, with a ring of miniature red roses set against green grasses. If I’m talking about a rich girl, the only thing my terrible imagination can come up with is, regrettably, roses. Roses, however, are very gorgeous flowers, and it’ll be a very showy piece.\n\n\n I knit together a jagged strip of lace, designed so that it’ll form into petals once it’s rolled up. When I decided it was long enough, I roll it up, stitch it shut along the bottom, then spread the petals out a little bit, turning it into a small rose.\n\n\n “Whoa, cute!”\n\n\n Happy because Tory praised me, I immediately get started on the second flower. My dad, drinking some liquor, looks over to see what’s happening, then turns to my mother, who’s been watching me this whole time and acting like she’s itching to jump in.\n\n\n “Say, Eva. If you’re so interested in doing that, would you like me to make you another set of needles?”\n\n\n “Dad,” says Tory, “I want some too, so make two sets please!”\n\n\n Emboldened by my mother’s grateful embrace and Tory’s begging, my father, in high spirits, gets some wood and starts whittling. Since he’s already made a set of these for me, it takes him a relatively short amount of time to craft each slender needle.\n\n\n Tory grabs the first completed set, then starts knitting along with me. Since she’s been going to apprentice as a seamstress, it seems like her skills have been leveling up; after thinking about it for a few moments, she starts knitting fluidly. To be honest, she’s faster than I am.\n\n\n My mother has been hungrily watching me work, so when she receives her freshly-made needles she smiles brilliantly at my father, then tears into the work with a fierceness I never thought was possible.\n\n\n “Maine,” says my father, “do you want your Daddy to make the pin part for you?” says my father eagerly.\n\n\n His hands are idle, now that he’s finished carving the needles. I feel bad for him, because he just wants to help his daughter with her work, but that part is Lutz’s job. If it were to be taken away from him, then since we’d no longer be making it together, there’d no longer be any justification for him having come along with me to Freida’s place and intruding on our meeting. Also, Lutz isn’t the kind of person who would accept money for doing nothing, so if he doesn’t actually help make the pins, despite the fact that he’s always been there with me as I go around, he’ll be the only one who doesn’t make any money from this.\n\n\n “You can be emotional support! Carving is Lutz’s job, please don’t take it from him.”\n\n\n “It’s always Lutz, Lutz, Lutz. Maine, why are being so cold to your Daddy lately?”\n\n\n My father, ever easy to read, sulks. He has way too much love for his family, so he gets strangely jealous about Otto and Lutz, to the point where sometimes it just gets annoying. I breathe a sigh, then shake my head.\n\n\n “If you want to make a hairpin, why don’t you not make pins for the other kids, but make one for my baptism? I’m planning on wearing a hairpin, so I kind of want something like before, with a hole in it…”\n\n\n “Oho, what’s this, Maine? You don’t want me to make them for the other kids, because you’d get jealous?”\n\n\n Wrong. I have no idea where you could have possibly gotten that impression.\n\n\n My father smiles broadly, due to whatever bizarre thoughts are bouncing around in his head, and starts working on making my hairpin. Since his mood is instantly good again, I shift my focus back to my needles. While I was busy talking to him, Tory and my mother have raced way ahead of me.\n\n\n “I think we should be good on the red flowers now. Let’s finish up the ones that we’re doing now.”\n\n\n I needed to make several roses like the first, but with three people working on it, it’s done in a flash. My mother is particularly fast. I, the one who is actually being paid to do this, am the by far the slowest.\n\n\n “Whaaat? Done already?”\n\n\n Tory pouts in dissatisfaction, perhaps because she found the knitting far more enjoyable than expected, but I merely shrug my shoulders as I finish forming the last of the roses into shape. Originally, my plan had been to have the left and right hairpins each have three miniature roses, but by the time I noticed how quickly they were getting made we had enough for four on each side. Given the size of each of them, we really don’t need any more than this.\n\n\n “It wouldn’t be right for us to waste any of the thread that someone else lent to us, right?”\n\n\n “Ah, that’s right. We shouldn’t use such a pretty thread on something useless.”\n\n\n Downhearted, Tory quietly agrees, then starts putting away her needles.\n\n\n “The next step is to make a lot of little flowers out of the white thread that I’ve asked Mister Benno for. I think white thread would match this red very well, so I think it would be a good thread to use. When I bring it back with me tomorrow, Tory, if it’s okay with you, you can help me with the white flowers too.”\n\n\n “Sounds like fun!”\n\n\n Tory smiles happily as she picks up her sewing box.\n\n\n …Hmmm, if Tory’s like this, I wonder if it would be okay for her to skip making baskets for her winter work and help me make hair ornaments instead?\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, Mark, Lutz, and I head out to the thread warehouse so that we can stock up on supplies. It’s the same shop that the craftsman we hired to make the paper mat took us to previously. The shopkeeper immediately stands up when he sees us, perhaps because we’d made such a big impression last time after buying the highest-quality spinne silk from him.\n\n\n “Ah, if it isn’t the folks who bought spinne silk a while ago! Are you here to buy some more?”\n\n\n “Yes,” replies Mark, “we’ll be coming back another day with our craftsman to make another purchase. Today, though, we’re here to inquire about a different kind of thread.”\n\n\n Mark’s words remind me of what Benno said earlier, that he’d have the craftsman make another paper mat for us by springtime. My head has lately been full of thoughts about Freida’s hairpins and my winter handiwork, but I can’t let myself forget about any of the preparations that need to be done in order for us to make paper come spring.\n\n\n …I want a notebook. I don’t want this slate, which gets erased whenever anything gets rubbed against it. I really want a notebook.\n\n\n “What can I help you with today?”\n\n\n “Umm,” I say, “I’m looking for a white thread that would match this one.”\n\n\n I pull Freida’s thread from my tote bag and hand it to the shopkeeper. He stares at it closely, then hums thoughtfully.\n\n\n “This is a very high-quality thread. What I’ve got that wouldn’t strange next to it would be… these ones.”\n\n\n He pulls out two kinds of thread and sets them down in front of me, then places the red thread next to them. After I spend some time looking back and forth between them to compare, I pick up the one that makes the red pop out a little more, then hand it to the shopkeeper.\n\n\n “Could I please get 100 feli of this thread, and 100 feli of that green you have there. Also, I’d like many different colors of the cheapest thread you have. I’d like 200 feli of each of those, please.”\n\n\n I need to separate the thread for Freida’s hairpins and the thread for my winter handiwork into two separate orders. I take out the order form set (the blank wooden order forms, the tape measure, the ink, and a wooden pen) that I always keep in my totebag. When I’ve finished describing the orders to the shopkeeper, I write them out immediately, my wooden pen clacking against the wood of the order forms.\n\n\n A lot of the cheaper threads don’t have particularly good coloring, but for only two large copper coins I can’t really make a huge fuss about it. These hairpins aren’t things that’ll be worn in everyday life, just for formal events. If the price is high enough that people would regret purchasing it for just a single occasion, the few people will buy it. I can’t let myself set my expectations by the six small silver coins the guild leader will pay for his granddaughter’s two pins.\n\n\n “These threads for your winter work will take some time for me to prepare, so how about I deliver these to your shop once I’m done with them?”\n\n\n “Yes, please do.”\n\n\n I put the high-quality white thread that I’ll be immediately using in my tote bag, then head out of the shop. Since the thread warehouse is close to Lutz and my houses, we split off from Mark in front of the thread warehouse and head back home. As we head home, I tell Lutz about how we were already able to finish the red part of the pins last night, and his eyes go wide.\n\n\n “Huh? Then, you’re already ready to finish off the pins? Didn’t you say that we had some time left, so you’d take your time on it?”\n\n\n “Yeah, I think it’ll be ready tomorrow or the day after. Mommy and Tory really want to help, and they’re way better and faster than me, so they did it in no time at all. If it were just me, it would have taken a lot longer.”\n\n\n My initial estimate of seven to ten days was based on me having to go to either the forest or the shop during the day, and working on the hairpins between dinner and bedtime. I hadn’t even considered the possibility that I might somehow finish everything off in just a single day.\n\n\n “Got it. I’ll get started on my pin part immediately.”\n\n\n “Yes, please! My dad really wants to join in and help make it, so…”\n\n\n “Man, seriously…”\n\n\n Lutz, seeing his work being almost stolen from him, hangs his head, sighing.\n\n\n “Although… I’ve been thinking about what we’d do if my family takes all the work from us, but that’s not quite right, is it? Merchants are people who let other people do the work making things so that they can buy and sell them. Mister Benno doesn’t make anything himself, but he’s still earning a commission off of the things we’re making, right?”\n\n\n “Huh. You’re right.”\n\n\n Lutz looks up at me, taken aback. It is not the case that we can’t earn any money if we don’t actually make anything. Merchants are people who can bring forth money by just moving goods from one place to another. We’re still thinking too much like craftsmen.\n\n\n “This time, we already told the guild leader and Mister Benno that we were going to be making these pins together, so even though it’s going to be difficult to change how we think so quickly, the two of us need to study really hard together how to work like a merchant.”\n\n\n “Yeah!”\n\n\n When I bring the thread home, the work that I had originally planned on doing was, just as I thought, snatched away from me by Tory and my mother.\n\n\n In the time it took me to make a single small flower, Tory made two, and my mother made four. In the blink of an eye, we were finished. Next, I was got ready to start making little leaf decorations out of the green thread, but the two of them wound up making the vast majority of them. Once again, I find myself pretty damn useless.\n\n\n …Conclusion: It is impossible for me to become a sewing beauty. Opening my path towards being a merchant’s apprentice was definitely the correct one."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Once I finish attaching the pin parts of the hairpins that Lutz made to the parts that I had made, I can’t help but breathe a little sigh of self-satisfaction at our accomplishment. The hairpins we made for Freida came out absolutely gorgeous, far more than I was expecting. Each one has four miniature red roses arranged on it, surrounded by a spray of tiny flowers, styled in the image of baby’s-breath, with the shape of green leaves poking out here and there from behind.\n\n\n “…Hey, Maine,” says Lutz, his face twitching as he sees the pin. “Isn’t this way different from Tory’s hairpin? This is super pretty.”\n\n\n The reasons are simple. First, we used a thread of much higher quality. Since the flower are made from a thinner, smoother thread, they are much finer and glossier. Secondly, the level of skill that went into them is very different. Unlike Tory’s hairpin, where the vast majority of the flowers were made by my pin, about eighty percent of the flowers on Freida’s hairpins were made by my mother and Tory, so they’re much more detailed and elaborate.\n\n\n “When you think about what her dress is made of and her general atmosphere, don’t you think that this suits her a lot better than Tory’s would?”\n\n\n “I have zero idea what you mean when you keep asking if something suits or doesn’t suit someone,” he says, shaking his head.\n\n\n I cross my arms, deep in thought. “Hmmm,” I say, “that’s something you’re going to need to learn too, since it looks like Mister Benno is starting to carry a lot more things that are marketed to the nobility.”\n\n\n Lutz lets his eyes wander off to the distance, perhaps because he doesn’t really want to look at something he’s bad at.\n\n\n “Heyyy, Maine. Now that we’re done, what do we do?”\n\n\n “I think that we should show it to Mister Benno first, and then deliver it to the guild leader. How about we try heading to Mister Benno’s shop now?”\n\n\n “Sounds good.”\n\n\n The finished hairpins have been placed in a small box, the top of which is covered by the nicest handkerchief in my house so that nobody can see what’s inside.\n\n\n “Maine, you hold the box. I’ll carry that bag for you.”\n\n\n With my slate, slate pencils, and ordering set in my tote bag, it’s gotten reasonably heavy, by my standards. Grateful, I quietly hand it over to Lutz, and receive the small box in exchange.\n\n\n “Ah,” says Mark when he sees us arrive, “what brings the two of you here today?”\n\n\n “We’ve completed the hairpins. I thought that it would be a good idea if, before we delivered it to the guild leader, we showed it to Mister Benno first, maybe…”\n\n\n “Oh? Show me,” says Benno, unexpectedly, from right behind me. Startled, I jump slightly in place.\n\n\n When I turn around, I see that he’s standing behind me, dressed impeccably in magnificent clothes, perhaps having just come back from visiting the nobility.\n\n\n “Welcome back, Master Benno,” says Mark.\n\n\n “Hey,” he replies, nodding. He looks down at me and Lutz. “…Come along, you two.”\n\n\n We follow him as he heads into his room, deeper in the shop.\n\n\n “So, then,” he says as he sits down at the table, “where are these completed hairpins?”\n\n\n I hold out the small box for Benno to see, removing the handkerchief that covers it.\n\n\n “What do you think about pins like this?”\n\n\n “…Maine, you… did not need to charge half price for the second one of these.”\n\n\n “Um? I still think that we’re massively overcharging even after that… since the only real materials cost is the thread, we’re making about three small silver coins worth of profit, right?”\n\n\n “You’re going to have to learn how much things are worth. Every single thing you’ve brought to me has been a luxury good. If you don’t know how to correctly price high-quality luxury items like these, you’ll throw the market into absolute chaos.”\n\n\n “…I’m sorry.”\n\n\n I’m well aware of how my own intuition does not mesh at all with how goods are priced in this world, so I can very much appreciate how Benno has had to become a breakwater against the tide of chaos I might bring to the town’s market. I already knew that clothing and decoration were high-priced goods, but since I don’t have the strength to walk around the town from store to store to do any research, I don’t have a sense for what kinds and qualities of things are being sold for what prices. On top of that, given my age and my bearing, I’d likely be refused entry to any shops that dealt in those kinds of high-priced goods.\n\n\n …Even still, luxury goods, huh? Simple shampoo, paper, and hairpins all used to be obvious stuff I’d find all around me, after all.\n\n\n I know, in my head, that the Middle Ages I read about in my books didn’t have any of these things, but in my heart I still don’t accept it. If something doesn’t exist, I keep searching for ways that I could find some sort of substitute or make it for myself.\n\n\n “Mister Benno,” I say, “I’d like to deliver this to the guild leader; what would be the best way to do so? I think I’d like to make an appointment to meet with him.”\n\n\n “Good idea. Now’s a good time, how about I show you how to do that?”\n\n\n He takes out an ordering set, writes out a request to meet with the guild leader, then fills in our names and the purpose for the meeting.\n\n\n “Now you can deliver this to the third floor of the guild. When they decide on a time for the appointment, a staff member will fill in the details here, then deliver it back to the shop.”\n\n\n “So, should we deliver it on our way home?”\n\n\n “…Ahhh, wait. If it’s just the two of you, you’ll be easy prey in that place. I’ll come along too.”\n\n\n He might be exaggerating the danger of just delivering a meeting request, I think.\n\n\n We go to the merchant’s guild and ascend to the third floor, Lutz and I using our own cards this time. After delivering the request card to the service counter, Lutz and I turn to head home, happy about a job well done, when the receptionist calls out to us.\n\n\n “Please wait one moment.”\n\n\n “Um?!”\n\n\n “I’ve been instructed that, if two people named Maine and Lutz were to arrive, that I show them in immediately.”\n\n\n Sure enough, we’re being let through. As I stumble about in flustered confusion, Benno glances down at me and murmurs, “do you see now?”\n\n\n Whoa, Mister Benno, you were absolutely correct! I’m so glad he came along with us.\n\n\n The guild leader shows us in when we arrive at his office, although his expression is a little less than agreeable when Benno comes in along with us.\n\n\n “What can I do for you today?”\n\n\n “We’ve finished the hairpins, and have brought them here for you.”\n\n\n “Well then, let’s take a look, shall we?”\n\n\n I take out the small box I brought with me, remove the handkerchief, and hold it out, as far as I can, towards the guild leader. Since Benno has already given his OK, I think everything will be fine, but I still can’t stop my heart from pounding.\n\n\n The guild leader peers into the box, then picks out one of the hairpins. He frowns as he inspects it closely, then looks over at me, eyebrows raised.\n\n\n “…This is very different than the one you showed me last time, is it not?”\n\n\n “I took extra care to ensure that the product was worth the price you were paying for it. Was the item you saw previously perhaps more to your liking? I had thought to make hairpins that would fit Miss Freida’s hairstyle and clothing better, after speaking with her, but…”\n\n\n As my face goes pale, wondering if he’s unhappy with it, the guild leader hurriedly shakes his head.\n\n\n “No, no, I’m merely surprised; I hadn’t expected such an excellent product. I think they really will suit Freida quite well.”\n\n\n “Ah, really? That’s good to hear.”\n\n\n As I reassure myself that there’s no way he could possibly reject it, the guild leader’s eyes suddenly gleam.\n\n\n “Maine, wouldn’t you like to work at m…”\n\n\n “Maine, it looks like we’re done here. We’re leaving.”\n\n\n Before the guild leader could even finish his sentence, Benno seizes Lutz’s and my arms and stands up. I contemplate if it’s best for us to leave now, since our business here is done, and quietly follow along behind him. Frantically, the guild leader blocks our path.\n\n\n “No, wait. Now that this is finally ready, I’d like you to deliver it to Freida yourself. I’m so happy that she’s made friends with another girl. When I hear that she made a friend the same age as her, I was overjoyed!”\n\n\n Oh ho, Freida’s made a friend? What a joyous occasion!\n\n\n As I so carefreely contemplate somebody else’s problems, Benno, having heard how moved the guild leader sounds, leans down next to me and whispers quietly in my ear.\n\n\n “You’ve… become her friend?”\n\n\n “Um! Me?! …Ummm, I, I wonder?”\n\n\n I knew that she had been quite pleased with me, although it was rather one-sided, but I wouldn’t really call this a friendship. However, it would be very difficult for me to deny it out loud in front of the guild leader, who is so obviously overjoyed that his granddaughter has made a friend.\n\n\n “I hear that she’ll be having sweets ready so that you can come over to play any time you’d like.”\n\n\n “…Sweets?”\n\n\n Benno flicks my forehead for letting that reaction slip. I know that I shouldn’t be showing any weakness, but I couldn’t stop my self as soon as the topic of sweet things came up.\n\n\n “Good! How about I take you to her right now?”\n\n\n The guild leader picks me up effortlessly, perhaps like he may have picked up Freida before, and brings me out of the room. Benno and Lutz stare, wide-eyed, as I’m abducted literally right from in front of them, then frantically chase after us.\n\n\n “Hey, wait,” says Benno. “I’m coming with you.”\n\n\n “Where Maine goes, I go!” says Lutz.\n\n\n It seems that it’s already been decided that we’re going, but the guild leader’s house is close to the castle walls, even further from my house than Benno’s shop is. To be perfectly honest, if I go, I don’t think I would have enough energy for me to return home.\n\n\n “…Sir,” I say, “I’m not very strong at all, and I don’t think I can walk any farther today.”\n\n\n “There’s no real need to walk. We’ll be taking my carriage.”\n\n\n “Carriage?!”\n\n\n I hadn’t really thought of those as something I could ride on. I’ve seen traders and farmers using wagons and carts, of both the horse- and hand-drawn varieties, along the main streets, but in my sphere of existence, each family is likely to have just one hand-drawn cart, and only adults are able to use them.\n\n\n This goes without saying, but things like rubber tires do not exist here, so when a cart is loaded with baggage, even an adult has to put quite a lot of effort into pulling it. It’s not at all the kind of thing that a child could use. On top of that, a child would most certainly not be allowed to use such an important item of which the family only has one. We must use our own two feet to get around. That’s that.\n\n\n Even more, horses are expensive. Donkeys are comparatively omnivorous, but since the hay that horses eat is expensive, even the maintenance costs are unattainably exorbitant.\n\n\n Tch. Rich people.\n\n\n As I stew in my envy of the guild leader’s wealthy status, he brings me down to the first floor of the Merchant’s Guild building, and puts me up into his carriage. Lutz and Benno, having come to their senses, catch up to us, getting onto the carriage as well, and all four of us get ready to depart, heading towards Freida’s place to make the delivery.\n\n\n This is my first time in a horse-drawn carriage.\n\n\n I’ve been on a hand-drawn cart before, during last year’s winter preparations, but this is my first time riding something that’s pulled by an animal. Lutz and I look around constantly, and the guild leader smiles wryly at us.\n\n\n “Heh. Maine, is this your first time riding a carriage?”\n\n\n “I’ve seen them going through the gates and driving on the roads, but neither Lutz nor I have anyone in our families that own one.”\n\n\n This is a vehicle that was intended to pull two adults, so it’s rather crowded. The two adults fit exactly on the seats, so Lutz and I are stuck, with apologies, on our butts on the shelf in the back, where luggage is supposed to go. Since we’re children, we’re somehow able to fit, but it’s rather dangerous.\n\n\n “…It’s cramped in here. Benno, get out.”\n\n\n “If I do, Maine comes with me.”\n\n\n Benno and the guild leader glare at each other for a little while, but eventually, the carriage starts slowly moving forward.\n\n\n “Whoaaoaooaaa!!”\n\n\n The cart jostles violently as it moves, making it impossible for me to stay still on my seat. Lutz has found safety by clinging desperately to the railing that’s intended to help people get on and off, but I have nothing to grab onto. With every bump of the road, it seems like I’m about to fly entirely out of my seat.\n\n\n “Maine, come here.”\n\n\n Benno sits me on his lap, one arm around my stomach, pinning me tightly so that I won’t fly away. Even still, each shake of the cart sends me almost floating off my butt, and if I’m not careful, the top of my head might slam into Benno’s jaw. I knew that a cart without any suspension would be a bumpy ride, but I had no idea it was going to be this awful.\n\n\n Horse-drawn carriages are not at all elegant vehicles.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Freida,” calls the guild leader, “Maine’s brought your hair ornaments!”\n\n\n “Well, Maine! Welcome.”\n\n\n Her cherry-blossom hair swaying airly behind her, Freida greets us with a gentle smile on her face.\n\n\n “Sorry for the intrusion,” I reply.\n\n\n “Madam Freida, it is nice to meet you. My name is Benno. I’ve heard much about you from Maine.”\n\n\n “Well, I wonder what kind of things she might have said?”\n\n\n They’re so politely greeting each other, yet this sends shivers down my spine.\n\n\n Lutz grabs my hand tightly, trembling as we listen to the two of them introduce themselves. I quickly glance over at him, and see that he’s gone pale. Neither of us are at all ready to join in the invisible battle between fellow merchants that’s happening right now. I wonder if the two of us will actually be able to someday send sparks flying with a smile like that?\n\n\n “Freida,” says the guild leader. Please handle receiving the hairpins from those two and pay them what they’re owed.“\n\n\n \"Yes, grandfather.”\n\n\n As the guild leader leads Benno to his own room, Freida leads Lutz and I to a similar sitting room as last time. Meanwhile, sweet drinks and sweet snacks have been brought out, and an entrancingly sweet smell drifts from the table.\n\n\n “Girls love sweet things, so I have some prepared so that you can come by to play any time! Maine, whenever you’re free, please come to play.”\n\n\n “Yes!” I answer, with a transcendent smile.\n\n\n Lutz pinches my hand under the table.\n\n\n Argh, that’s right. I cannot let myself succumb to sweet temptation. I mustn’t succumb, I mustn’t s… sniff, sniff, ah, bliss~!\n\n\n Honey-soaked nuts have been layered on top of a thin pizza dough, baked, sliced, and set out for me.\n\n\n “Come! Maine, Lutz, please enjoy!”\n\n\n “Thank you!”\n\n\n Nom, nom. The ample honey makes it deliciously sweet. What a luxurious confection. Is this heaven?\n\n\n For a while, I just let myself eat my fill, recalling memories of nut tarts I had in Japan. Sweet things really do bring happiness.\n\n\n “Thank you very much. It was quite delicious.”\n\n\n “I’m very happy you thought so. I’ll be sure to convey that to the chef.”\n\n\n Wow, madam, you have a chef. So, she said she had prepared sweets for us, but her chef prepared them for us, and all she did was bring them out. What a stratified society.\n\n\n “Now then,” she says, “would you perhaps like to show me the hairpins, now?”\n\n\n “Certainly. Ah, before that, let me return the remaining thread.”\n\n\n “…Oh my, you don’t really need to.”\n\n\n No, no, I can’t actually keep an expensive thread like this. When talking to the guild leader or to Freida, I know deep in my heart that there’s nothing more terrifying than getting something for free. I can’t accept things from them so freely. I can’t give into temptation.\n\n\n “Miss Freida, here are―”\n\n\n “Maine, the two of us are friends! Please, just call me Freida.”\n\n\n When such a lovely, cute little girl says something like that with such a dazzling smile, there’s no way I can just say “we aren’t friends, though?”. Flustered, I fumble about for a way out.\n\n\n “Um? But, you’re a customer…”\n\n\n “Oh my. …Well, with this, I’m not anymore!”\n\n\n Smiling broadly, Freida takes the box containing her hairpins from me, and in exchange, places a stack of six small silver coins in front of Lutz and I.\n\n\n “I have received my order and paid the bill. Now there’s nothing in the way of our friendship!”\n\n\n “…Very well.”\n\n\n With all avenues of escape closed, and in a situation where I can’t just say no, I defeatedly nod my head in acceptance. Depending on how you think about it, she’s a friend whose appearance does not match her personality at all, so it won’t be a problem if I’m a little weird myself. Let’s take this as a good thing.\n\n\n If she’s fine with me just calling her “Freida”, I wonder if I can speak a little more casually?\n\n\n “Umm, then, Freida. Would you like to take a look at the hairpins?”\n\n\n “Of course! Don’t mind if I do.”\n\n\n Freida gently pinches the handkerchief between two fingers, then pulls it away. When she takes one of the hairpins out of the box, her eyes grow wide.\n\n\n “Well! How magnificent! Since my baptism is in the winter, snow will have started falling by the time the ceremony comes around, so there won’t be any flowers or berries to use as hair ornaments, you know? I’ve been terribly envious of the children whose ceremonies were in the spring and summer. In a season where all the plants are withered, being able to clad myself in brilliant flowers and green leaves makes me so happy!”\n\n\n “I’m glad to hear that.”\n\n\n Now that I think of it, Tory had initially said that her hair decorations were going to be flowers that she could pick nearby. In that case, these hairpins should sell very well during the winter.\n\n\n “Try putting them on,” I say. “I want to see how they look in your hair.”\n\n\n “I don’t quite know how to do that. Maine, might I trouble you to?”\n\n\n “Sure! If you could give me those…”\n\n\n I take the hairpins from her, then insert each of them into the base of her pigtails, where they’re tied off with string. The small, deep red roses stand out beautifully against her light, cherry-blossom pink hair, further enhancing her general air of maturity.\n\n\n Roses were definitely the right choice.\n\n\n “You’re very cute, Freida! Like a fairy of the flowers.”\n\n\n “You flatter me too much!” she says, daintily covering her mouth as she bashfully giggles. “You’re just like my grandfather.”\n\n\n This isn’t flattery. If I didn’t know anything about her personality, she’d be the kind of little girl I’d want to kidnap and run away with.\n\n\n “It’s not flattery! It’s a really cute look, and it suits you. Lutz, you think so too, right?”\n\n\n “Yeah. When I was just looking at the pins, I didn’t think that they were going to fit you so well. Maine made these to just to match you. You’re super cute.”\n\n\n “……”\n\n\n Freida, whose face is growing red and whose cheeks are growing puffy, is clearly not used to being praised like this. I can instantly see from her reaction that she really doesn’t have any siblings or friends.\n\n\n In this world, it’s common for friends and family to be constantly praising each other. I’ve been extolling Tory’s virtues, and she’s been praising me in return. Lutz praises me whenever I do something, and I’ve started to grow accustomed to praising others as well. It was startling to me at first, to the point where I’d shy away from it, but lately I’ve been able to go along with this kind of constant lip service.\n\n\n “Even so,” she says, “to be able to build such solid shapes out of thread…”\n\n\n Freida has extracted the hairpins from her head and has started studying them in careful detail, like Benno and the guild leader had done before. Her eyes have completely become like those of a merchant.\n\n\n “It’s not all that difficult,” I say. “Even I can do it!”\n\n\n “…The discovery of this construction method is a very big deal, Maine.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n Freida sighs lightly, then looks at me with a far more serious expression than I was expecting.\n\n\n “The wives and daughters of the upper nobility are fond of wearing brightly-colored veils of unblemished embroidery. They also wear decorations made of real flowers that have been frozen in time via magic. However, nobody has any ornaments with shape like this.”\n\n\n The nobility who use ornaments like this use magic to do so, so perhaps decorations like this were never actually developed? As I hum thoughtfully to myself, Freida continues to explain the magnificence of these decorations.\n\n\n “There is so much fabric in this house with so much embroidery, but not a single piece of it has this kind of shape. To be able to make a solid object with nothing but thread is completely groundbreaking!”\n\n\n When she says it like that, I finally get it. This is why Benno said there was no need to sell the second pin at half price. This is, essentially, a new technology. I suddenly feel extremely conspicuous.\n\n\n Have I, perhaps, done something really, really terrible?\n\n\n I can feel my face going pale. Freida reaches out grabs my hands tightly.\n\n\n “Maine, you know a lot of unexpected, unknown things, right? If so, I have a lot of things I can teach you too. So, next time, I want you to just come and chat, not to work! I’ll have plenty of sweets prepared for you, so let’s have a nice long chat, with just us girls!”\n\n\n “Ah, that sounds―”\n\n\n Great, I was about to say, but I feel a sharp tug on my hair. I reflexively turn my head, and see Lutz looking at me with a grim face, shaking his head.\n\n\n Argh, that was close. I almost carelessly agreed to have a nice, long, girls-only chat.\n\n\n If I’d let that slip, then I’d run the risk of having both Lutz and Benno completely excluded. I’m at a loss for words, with no idea how to actually answer the question, so Lutz steps up in my place.\n\n\n “We’re going to be very busy from now on, so unfortunately we don’t have much time to come over and play.”\n\n\n “Oh my,” she says, smiling peacefully, “but I didn’t ask you, did I?”\n\n\n She may say that, but my ability to go out is fundamentally dependent on Lutz.\n\n\n “Maine’s family doesn’t let her go out if I’m not going to be there with her. So, if I’m not here too, Maine won’t be able to come.”\n\n\n “…Ah, that’s right. There’s no helping it, then. Lutz, you are welcome to come as well.”\n\n\n Is it because she had this devouring disease as well? Freida immediately understood my situation, then nodded in agreement. Lutz, however, isn’t nodding. He stands unwavering in his denial.\n\n\n “Like I said earlier, we’re busy.”\n\n\n “Busy with what?”\n\n\n “We’re starting to get serious about winter preparations. The entire family needs to work together to prepare ourselves for the winter, so there really isn’t any free time for us to come and chat. Also, once snow starts falling, we won’t be able to go outside, right?”\n\n\n That’s right, unlike Freida, whose family can just buy all the firewood they need, preparing the huge quantity of firewood and making all of the candles we need is extremely difficult. It seems like even Freida knows how difficult winter preparations are, so she just slumps her shoulders, not pressuring us any more.\n\n\n “…So we can’t see each other until the spring?”\n\n\n “Aren’t you going to be doing your apprenticeship in the springtime? Is that going to be alright?”\n\n\n “That’ll be just fine. It’s not like my apprenticeship will have me working every day of the week. I’ll have plenty of sweets prepared come springtime, so please do come by to play!”\n\n\n When spring comes around, Lutz and I will likely be very busy making paper, but since Benno is still keeping that business hidden from the guild leader, I keep my mouth shut.\n\n\n I give Freida a big nod, then look over at Lutz.\n\n\n “Now that I think about it, Lutz, you didn’t react much to the sweets, did you? You usually leap right onto whatever food’s in front of you, so why?”\n\n\n “Master Benno told me to keep a good eye on you, and also the parucakes and the other things you make are way tastier. I like food I can always eat more than occasional sweets. I’d be in trouble if you got taken away.”\n\n\n It seems that Lutz, who is always hungry, considers maintaining the richness of his current eating habits far more important than eating the occasional sweet. If that’s the case, then I should head to his place with some more new recipes, I think.\n\n\n “Oh my, I haven’t heard of parucakes before. I would be very interested in trying food you’ve made as well, Maine.”\n\n\n “Um? That’s, well…”\n\n\n I couldn’t possibly feed confections made from squeezed-out paru fruit, which would usually be considered bird food, to the pampered daughter of a family like this. Her grandfather would get so angry veins would pop out on his head, and the chef who probably manages their nutritional requirements would go berserk.\n\n\n “You’re saying that Lutz is good enough to eat your food, but I’m not?” she says, teasingly, wearing the saddest frown.\n\n\n I may be increasingly flustered, but there’s still no way I can bring parucakes in front of a rich girl.\n\n\n Lutz chimes in. “The ingredients are… not something we could feed a young lady like yourself.”\n\n\n “Lutz, you’re so mean!”\n\n\n Freida pouts. With lips pursed, she pouts. No matter how cutely she may be pouting, though, what’s impossible is impossible. There’s nothing at my house that’s fit for Freida to eat.\n\n\n Besides, making sweets requires help. There really aren’t many things that I can prepare entirely on my own. At Lutz’s house, I’ve introduced so many new recipes that I always have four boys who will spare no effort to help in order to eat good food. I can’t make anything without ingredients or assistance. Not only am afflicted by the devouring, but I don’t think that Freida, who was not only also afflicted but is also a pampered rich girl, would have much in the way of physical strength nor stamina.\n\n\n “…Umm, so, how about next time, when it’s spring, we make something together with the ingredients you have here? Your chef could help us too. If that’s the case, we don’t need to worry about the ingredients, and there will be people to help us, and your family can have a little more peace of mind? How about it?”\n\n\n “Well, that’s marvelous! That’s settled, then.”\n\n\n As soon as we decide on making sweets together, a knock comes at the door shortly before the guild leader and Benno enter.\n\n\n “Hey,” says Benno. “You almost finished? We’re leaving.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir,” I reply. “Umm, Mister Benno. Could you…”\n\n\n The six small silver coins that Freida gave us in remuneration are quite a lot of money. To be frank, I’m too scared to carry it myself. As I hold it out for him to look after, he glances at the guild leader.\n\n\n “Sorry, but do you mind if I borrow your parlor for a moment? I’d like to settle up with these two before we head home.”\n\n\n “Ahh, you wouldn’t be here if I hadn’t dragged you all out. Please, be my guest.”\n\n\n Benno waits until the guild leader and Freida have left the room, then takes the coins from me and lines them up on the table.\n\n\n “The materials cost and my commission comes out to three small silver coins; the remaining three are yours. If you hadn’t charged half price for the second one, you’d have earned two more.”\n\n\n “…This is enough. If I’d sold these hairpins for any more, I’d feel bad about making the ones we’ll sell more cheaply.”\n\n\n Benno snorts, pulling out his coinpurse.\n\n\n “What do you want to do with the money? Are you going to bring it all home with you?”\n\n\n “I’d like to deposit one silver at the guild, and bring five large copper coins home with me.”\n\n\n “Me too,” says Lutz.\n\n\n As if he already knew what we were going to say, Benno has already pulled out his guild card and a handful of copper coins. With a touch of our cards, our accounts are settled. I wrap my five copper coins in my handkerchief and place them in my tote bag.\n\n\n “The guild leader said he’d bring you back to the guildhall in his carriage. Go with him.”\n\n\n “What about you, Mister Benno?”\n\n\n “I’ll walk. That carriage is pretty small. Come to the store tomorrow afternoon. Your thread should have arrived by then. We have to decide on a price as well.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir.”\n\n\n What could Benno have been discussing with the guild leader, I wonder? He seems far less exceptionally wary than he did before."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Hey, Maine, why is it that you deposit a silver coin at the guild every time? Why aren’t you bringing it all home to your family?”\n\n\n As we leisurely walk home, having gotten off the carriage at the Merchant’s Guild, Lutz spontaneously asks me this question.\n\n\n “Aren’t you doing the same thing?” I reply.\n\n\n “I’m doing it because you’re doing it. I thought there must be some sort of reason for it, so I was copying you. My family thinks that I’m bringing all of my earnings home, though, so I kind of feel a little bad about it…”\n\n\n For commoners, who are used to scraping through their daily lives without any money to spare, there isn’t really any concept of “savings”. At most, when autumn comes around, they start stashing away a little money in their dresser drawers for winter preparations. They don’t do anything like depositing money at the Merchant’s Guild. Of course, since kids learn things by watching their parents, even the children bring all of their earnings home to their families and spend it all on living expenses.\n\n\n “I’m saving for next time’s initial expenses, you know.”\n\n\n “Next time’s initial expenses?” he asks, his head tilted curiously to the side.\n\n\n Drawing on our own experiences, I explain it to him.\n\n\n “Remember how after we decided we were going to make paper, we didn’t have any tools, any money, nor any adults that we could ask for help, so even getting a single nail was really hard and we got in a lot of trouble?”\n\n\n “Yeah.”\n\n\n It wasn’t all that long ago that we had gotten scolded by Benno for begging Otto for help. Lutz, remembering this, smiles wryly.\n\n\n “We got lucky when Mister Benno bought the formula for my ‘simple shampoo’ in exchange for covering all of our initial expenses, but getting all of those tools took a huge amount of money, right, Lutz? Whenever you’re starting something, you need money.”\n\n\n “The pot, the wood, the ash, the thread, the bamboo work… now that I think about it, that was really expensive, wasn’t it?”\n\n\n Lutz, who has recently been visiting various stores for the sake of stocking up on things, understands the quality and cost of things that are sold not at ordinary street stalls, but actual stores. His face goes pale as he realizes just how much the initial investments for our paper-making enterprise really cost.\n\n\n “And that’s why I’m saving money. Since we made a working prototype for Mister Benno, he said that we were done with initial expenses, right? I think that we’ll need even more tools to keep making paper from now on, and I also want to start making something new, and all of that requires money. Once we make a lot of paper, and we start trying to make books, we’ll need new tools for that too.”\n\n\n “So, it’s for the next stuff, huh…”\n\n\n I can’t figure out if Lutz’s expression means he has or has not actually understood this. I stare at him fixedly. He has far more pressing reasons than I to actually need to be saving money, but is he aware of them? I wonder if he hasn’t even noticed.\n\n\n After thinking about it for a moment, I slowly open my mouth.\n\n\n “I don’t really want to say or even really think about this, but… Lutz, if by the time we’re baptized your parents still don’t approve of you becoming a merchant, what are you going to do? …Have you… thought about that?”\n\n\n His face twists painfully as soon as I ask my question. He answers in a low mumble, without any strength behind his voice at all.\n\n\n “…I think I’d have to be a live-in apprentice at Master Benno’s shop.”\n\n\n “Yeah, if you want to become a merchant, you’ll have to do that, right? I’m glad you didn’t say you’d give up.”\n\n\n When Lutz seems me smiling, he sighs, looking just a little bit relieved. He’s talking about leaving his home behind at such an early age, which takes tremendous resolve, and I think he must still have some doubts about it. Lutz, however, is moving entirely along his own path, which means that he really will be needing money.\n\n\n “But, Lutz, think about it. If you leave home to become a live-in apprentice, then until your first pay comes in you’ll still need money for living expenses, the clothing you’ll need for your apprenticeship, and so on. There’ll be a huge difference between the Lutz that leaves home with money saved up for his freedom and the Lutz that doesn’t have anything.”\n\n\n “Ah…”\n\n\n Lutz raises his head to look at me, looking completely taken aback.\n\n\n “I don’t think it’s bad at all for you to take the money that you yourself earned and save it away for your own future, you know. I know we’re supposed to be giving everything we earn to the family, so you might feel guilty about it, but you’re not even old enough to be really working, anyway, and you brought home thirteen large copper coins over five days, you know? That’s more than Ralph brings home from his apprenticeship, you know? So it’s really okay.”\n\n\n “Huh… I make more than Ralph.”\n\n\n Lutz smiles proudly. Ralph, who’s still only recently started his apprenticeship, probably brings home only about eight to ten large copper coins over an entire month. The amount the two of us have earned is huge in comparison.\n\n\n “Maine, thanks. I’m feeling way better about this now.”\n\n\n “I’m glad!”\n\n\n Grinning broadly, Lutz suddenly turns away from me for some reason, then squats down.\n\n\n “What’re you doing, Lutz?”\n\n\n “Get on my back,” he replies.\n\n\n “What?”\n\n\n “We’ve gone to a lot of different places today, so you must be getting tired, right? You’re looking a little pale.”\n\n\n Without thinking about it, I reach up to feel my face. I still don’t feel particularly feverish, so I don’t think I have a fever.\n\n\n “…I’m looking pale?”\n\n\n “It’s not that bad right now, but we need to be meeting with Master Benno tomorrow afternoon, so I think you shouldn’t push too hard. My number one job is looking after your health, after all.”\n\n\n “…Alright. Thanks, then!”\n\n\n It’s very true that, after a day of walking from place to place, I’m getting rather worn out. Since Lutz is telling me not to push too hard, things must be getting really dangerous.\n\n\n Lutz takes me home, with me on his back. I, of course, climb the stairs up under my own power, but since there’s a chance I might get too tired halfway up, Lutz comes up with me, leading me by the hand. He’s seriously a big help.\n\n\n To be perfectly honest, climbing the stairs up to my home is the hardest part.\n\n\n “I’m home, Mommy.”\n\n\n “Oh my, Lutz! It’s rare for you to come all the way up here, isn’t it? Is Maine not doing well today?”\n\n\n “We’d originally planned to just go show the hairpins to Master Benno today, but we wound up meeting the guild leader too, and then he invited us to his house immediately. He said that he wanted us to deliver the hairpins in person. So, I think that she’s probably very tired right now.”\n\n\n “I see. Thanks as always, Lutz. You’re a big help.”\n\n\n As she says that, she slips a bribe, a medium copper coin, into his hand. When I see the coin, I remember something.\n\n\n “Ah, that’s right! Mommy, I want to give you this before I forget.”\n\n\n “Maine… what in the world have you done now?”\n\n\n When my mother sees the five large copper coins I hold out for her, all the color drains from her face. Her eyes go as wide as I’ve ever seen them, as if there’s no way she could have possibly thought that the hairpins were worth anywhere close to that much money.\n\n\n “This is the money from making the hairpins for Freida. I said that she was buying them for a lot of money because they were so rare, right?”\n\n\n “I heard you say that, but… really, this much money…”\n\n\n I’m sorry, Mother. There’s no way that I can tell you that this is after the introduction, handling, and materials fees as well as the small silver coin I set aside for my own personal use. Not with this atmosphere, anyway.\n\n\n “Is this true, Lutz?” she asks him.\n\n\n “She’s not lying, Auntie Eva. Since I worked on it too, I got the same amount too. Maine and I split it halfway.”\n\n\n As he says it, he shows my mother his own share of the money. With that, my mother is finally convinced, and places a hand on her chest to calm herself down.\n\n\n Hey, wait, Mother. I’m your daughter, why don’t you believe me?\n\n\n “Master Benno called us out to his shop tomorrow as well, so we’re going to have to go there again. So, I want to make sure Maine gets as much rest as she can.”\n\n\n “Thanks again, Lutz.”\n\n\n After we see Lutz off, my mother closes the door behind him with a clack. With her eyebrows raised, she throws me straight into bed.\n\n\n “Don’t overdo it, Maine. Even so, you sold that for a lot of money, didn’t you?”\n\n\n “Yeah. Freida’s really rich, and the thread was really high quality, and we made two instead of just one, you know? Plus, since everyone’s so busy this season with winter preparations, she paid a high fee for that, too. So, if we make it for other people, it’s not going to be that expensive.”\n\n\n “I see! She was being considerate, since it’s such a busy season for us.”\n\n\n It seems like my mother’s image of the guild leader and Freida is one of kind, gentlemanly rich people who consider the plight of the poor. Since I don’t think she’s ever going to actually meet these two, I don’t think I need to dispel her illusions. My mother, relieved now that she knows why her child brought home so much money, heads out of the bedroom so that she can work on preparing dinner for the family.\n\n\n I, left behind in the bedroom, really do feel like a heavy weight presses down on me. As soon as I lay down on the bed, I start drifting off and soon, without even eating dinner, fall into a deep sleep.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n When I awaken, it’s already morning. Since I’m going to be going to Benno’s shop in the afternoon, I decide that I should spend the morning resting. It’s only about half my choice. Thanks to the fact that I’ve been going out quite a bit lately, my body is still rather heavy despite the fact that I got quite a bit of sleep. My family, seeing flickers of signs that my fever may be returning, have forcefully thrown me back to bed as they do their winter preparations.\n\n\n “Maine, be good and rest up,” commanded my father as he inspected our wooden front door. “You’ve been working too hard lately! You’re making more money than Daddy, you know?”\n\n\n Tory and my mother, as they spread out the thick blankets and carpets we’ll be using during the winter so they can air out, tell me,\n\n\n “You’re going to Mister Benno’s shop today as well, aren’t you? If you don’t sit quietly this morning, you’re going to collapse again, you know?”\n\n\n “Maine, you’re not really useful for winter preparations, so focus on what you’re actually good for.”\n\n\n And, with that, they prohibit me from leaving my bed. Since there’s nothing else I can do, I squirm my way back under the blankets, watching as my family ceaselessly moves about, working on their preparations.\n\n\n This year, unlike last year, I actually understand what goes into preparing for the winter, so I really thought I could be a little more useful, though…\n\n\n I think my family’s excessive care might be because I came home yesterday, delivered five large copper coins to my mother, then promptly fell fast asleep. I, who can’t even satisfactorily do a single thing around the house to help out, earned thirteen large copper coins over the course of not even five days, and then slept so soundly that I missed dinner. They suspect, in their minds, that I must have been doing some absurdly hard labor.\n\n\n However, over the past few days, I’ve been going around to a lot of different places, which for me really is a kind of hard labor.\n\n\n When the fourth bell rings at noon, I grab my tote bag as usual and head out the front door, dressed to keep out the cold.\n\n\n “I’m off,” I say.\n\n\n When I reach the bottom of the stairs and meet Lutz, he greets me with a little frown.\n\n\n “Maine, you don’t look too good, you know? Isn’t it okay if I go by myself?”\n\n\n “It’s because we’ve been so busy lately. Mister Benno said that we were going to talk about pricing for our winter handiwork today, though, so I’m going today. I’ll leave carrying the thread to you, Lutz, but I want to go so that I can handle deciding on a price.”\n\n\n “…Right, pricing, yeah. I still don’t really understand that.”\n\n\n I can’t, of course, leave deciding prices to Lutz yet, since he still doesn’t understand numbers very well. Today, I just want to go to the shop and discuss things relating to the pricing of the hairpins with Benno.\n\n\n “Well, at least let me carry you there.”\n\n\n “What? No, I can’t ask that. You already carried me home yesterday…”\n\n\n “I’m going to be carrying all the thread back with me today, so I can’t carry you then. So, save your energy for now.”\n\n\n I know full well that it’s impossible to get Lutz to back down when he gets this stubborn in times like this, so I get up on his back. Even though I’ve grown a little bit taller, I feel like Lutz has gotten even bigger. Although I know it’s because of my illness, it’s still a little frustrating that there’s this much of a difference in size despite us being the same age.\n\n\n “Lutz? It seems that you’re carrying Maine, is she all right?”\n\n\n When Mark sees Lutz approach with me on his back, he rushes towards us, with startled eyes wide open. He reacts far too sensitively to my physical condition. It seems like me collapsing to the ground right in front of him caused quite a bit of trauma. I’m really, really sorry about that.\n\n\n “…Lately, we’ve been going out every single day to go to various places, so she’s started to get a little tired. I think she’ll probably be stuck in bed after tonight. So, I’d like to finish up our business as fast as we can.”\n\n\n “I understand,” he says with a nod, then leads us to the room in the back. “Master Benno, Maine and Lutz have arrived.”\n\n\n “Bring 'em in.”\n\n\n The door opens with a creak, and Mark shows us in, following shortly behind us.\n\n\n “Lutz has informed me that Maine’s condition is not very good today. Please consider conducting your business with haste today.”\n\n\n “Got it. Sit down, you two.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir.”\n\n\n As soon as we arrive at the table, we immediately begin discussing our winter handiwork. Benno informs us of the price of the thread, I estimate how many we could make with these quantities of material, and we decide on a price.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, I’d like to avoid making these hairpins too expensive. Since the thread we’re using is cheap as well, could we maybe price it as cheaply as we need to so that many people would be able to purchase them?”\n\n\n “I understand how you feel, Maine, but there’s no way I can sell these at a bargain right from the start. The price is only going to decrease once a lot of these start entering the market. We should be selling these for about three large copper coins at first.”\n\n\n Since these are for special occasions, that’s a price that my family could hypothetically afford, although it would be a bit of a reckless expenditure. It’s a little harsh, I think, but if sisters could share them with each other, somehow… if I consider that prices will slowly go down from this initial price, I think I can say that this is alright.\n\n\n “If that’s the case, that’s fine, then. I understand.”\n\n\n After I nod in agreement, the conversation next moves onto Lutz and my share of the profit.\n\n\n “For each hairpin, your cut is about five medium coins after the materials cost and my commission. I’ve set it higher than usual, since this is a new handicraft and there’s nobody else I can order these from.”\n\n\n “Five medium copper coins is high?! Doesn’t that mean that we really ripped the guild leader off for Freida’s hairpins?!”\n\n\n At the price Benno had negotiated, our share after making two hairpins should have been five small silver coins. That’s a hundredfold increase in price.\n\n\n “That was based on that old bastard’s opening bid, so don’t worry about that.”\n\n\n “…So, ordinarily, how much would we be getting?”\n\n\n Last year, I helped Tory out with her basket-weaving handiwork, but the two of us were never actually given any of that money, so I was never really curious about how much each one was actually worth.\n\n\n “For things like winter handiwork, us merchants take our commission, then the master of the sewing or craftsman’s workshops takes his cut as well, so the amount that the people who actually make the thing would get is about one medium copper coin per item, I think? Since this order is going direct to you, without going through a workshop, your cut is high.”\n\n\n “What?! One medium copper coin… it’s that little?!”\n\n\n After my initial shock wears off, I remember that the things people back in Japan made at home for a little side income were also pretty cheap. Something like a beaded strap would be something like 50 yen each. If I think about it like that, one medium copper coin each isn’t that surprising. Getting five coins is actually extraordinary.\n\n\n “At workshops, the only people who can actually buy and sell things are basically just the masters. The amount any given workshop master takes can vary somewhat, though? Maine, don’t you have any experience with that?”\n\n\n Since I said we could make hairpins for winter handiwork, he’s asking, don’t we already know how this works? I think about what happened last year.\n\n\n “Last year, I helped my older sister Tory with her work. I was working without any actual knowledge of how much they cost or what the commissions were, and I didn’t see any of the money from that. Huh? Now that I think about it, since we were selling something, we needed a guild membership, wouldn’t we? I wonder if my mother’s registered?”\n\n\n The one who delivered Tory’s and my handiwork was my mother, but I’ve never once heard her mention anything about going to the Merchant’s Guild. When I said I’d gone, she’d asked about it as if it were something very rare.\n\n\n “Ah, so your mother runs a street stall, does she?”\n\n\n “No, she usually works as a dyer, I think.”\n\n\n “If that’s the case, then that was probably work given to her for the winter. Since each worker just delivers the products of work she was assigned to do by her job, there’s no need for each of them to be registered with the Merchant’s Guild. It’s fine if the master’s the only one registered, as a representative of the studio.”\n\n\n It seems that the managers at the places where craftsmen work handle the actual buying and selling of things, so individual employees don’t need to be registered as merchants. Instead, it seems like craftsmen register with the various crafting guilds.\n\n\n Whoa, this is the first I’m hearing about that. Then, if I were to get help on making the hairpins, it would have to be after they meet their quotas.\n\n\n “In other words, last year’s handiwork was assigned to my mother at work, and Tory helped her out with that, and then I helped Tory out in turn.”\n\n\n “What did you make?”\n\n\n “I made things like this. This is the first one I made, so it’s very simple, but I made the others I helped with in my spare time a lot more elaborate.”\n\n\n Triumphantly, I hold up my totebag to show it off. Benno, in response, smiles bitterly, rubbing his temples.\n\n\n “What’s the matter?” I ask.\n\n\n “…So it was you, again?”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n Why is he saying “again”? Now that I think about it, I think I’ve seen that particular bitter smile before. Have I, once again, done something bad?\n\n\n “I recall that amongst all of the baskets being sold near the end of spring, there certainly were some number of finely decorated bags like that. For winter handiwork, if you can’t handle the quantity, your income won’t increase. Since it’s quick and dirty work, there’s a lot of roughly woven baskets out there, so those really stood out far too much, I’m afraid.”\n\n\n “Nooooooooooo!”\n\n\n I, in my free time, tried making somewhat elaborate handbags, and then taught Tory how to do it… I never thought that those would stand out so much on the market.\n\n\n “I wanted to know who made them, and I was able to track down the workshop they came from, but since all of the winter handiwork was turned in basically all at once, I wasn’t able to determine the specific craftsman who’d made them.”\n\n\n “Ah, that’s good~… you didn’t find out…”\n\n\n I’m well aware that I’m a little different, so I’ve been trying to keep myself hidden from the world as much as I can, but I have a feeling that doing so might not actually be possible.\n\n\n “Since a bag you made for yourself would be, of course, as durable as you could make it, I didn’t think that the one you carry was particularly unnatural, and there aren’t any decorations on it, so I hadn’t made the connection until now, but… it seems like every single mysterious thing I’ve seen in the last half year or so have all come from you, Maine.”\n\n\n Elaborate bags, hairpins, simple shampoo, paper… now that I’m actually counting them out, I’m growing increasingly perplexed. Now that I’ve heard Benno’s perspective, I can’t actually say that my actions were at all those of someone who wanted to stay hidden. Feeling so amazingly ashamed that I have no idea what else to do, I apologize in a tiny voice.\n\n\n “…I’m sorry, I guess.”\n\n\n “Well, whatever. More importantly, it looks like you have a tendency to make things elaborate in your free time. For the hairpins, just make the same design as the first one you did. Don’t change it arbitrarily. This is final. Got that?”\n\n\n “I understand. The colors on them will be different, but they’ll all have a unified design.”\n\n\n I never would have thought that the bags I made last year would have stood out so much, and I definitely do not want any new hairpins to stand out so terribly as the ones I made for Freida. I can sidestep this problem entirely by making sure that the design of each hairpin matches the rest.\n\n\n “I think that concludes all of the business we need to talk about for now. Ah, that’s right; you said you wanted to study during the winter, didn’t you? I’ll lend this to you for now, look over it when you get home.”\n\n\n “…What’s this?”\n\n\n When I look down at the wooden notes he hands me, he firmly pinches my cheek.\n\n\n “When you get home! Got it?!”\n\n\n “Yeth!!”\n\n\n “Good grief…. You can bring it back when your fever’s gone back down. Head home right away and get some sleep. Lutz, keep an eye on this idiot. She looks like the type to get in some kind of accident walking home because she’s too busy reading.”\n\n\n Suddenly remembering the time during my Urano years where I was heading home from school with my nose in a book and got hit by a car, I shut my mouth tightly and look away in embarrassment.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n As we leave, Mark gives us the basket he’s prepared for us, full of the thread that we had ordered, which Lutz takes. We depart for home, with Mark seeing us off with an extremely concerned look on his face. We take it at a slow, leisurely pace. On the way, I ask Lutz about something that I want to discuss with him before I’m stuck in bed for a while.\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz, about splitting things up on the hairpins…”\n\n\n “What’s up?”\n\n\n “Since the flower part takes way more time to make than the pin part, do you think we can split it three coins to two?”\n\n\n “Sounds good. If we’re thinking about the time it takes, I’d be fine with four to one, I think.”\n\n\n If we’re just thinking about time, then Lutz has the better suggestion, but I’ve got a somewhat different reason behind asking for three to two.\n\n\n “In that case, since your math is so terrible, let’s stick with three to two.”\n\n\n “My math?”\n\n\n “Right! This time, we’ll each take one coin for our commission, and we can pay two medium copper coins for each flower part, and one coin for each pin part. Why don’t we get our families to do those?”\n\n\n “Huh? Our families?”\n\n\n Lutz tilts his head doubtfully, as if he has no idea what I could possibly be saying. I press on.\n\n\n “Yeah! If I think about my own speed for the flower parts, I don’t think I could make any more than about thirty of them a month. Since we’d be in a fix if we had a lot of pin parts left over, how about to start with you get your family to make thirty pins in a month? Then we can charge a commission for them.”\n\n\n “And that’s so we can become merchants?”\n\n\n Lutz, remembering our earlier discussion about the differences between merchants and craftsmen, seems to be understanding the point I’m trying to get at.\n\n\n “Right, don’t you want to start acting like Mister Benno? You need to study really hard in order to be a good merchant’s apprentice, you know? I think it’s impossible to make only the hairpin part. Well, if you make any yourself, then I think you can do whatever you want with the money you make from the stuff you make, though.”\n\n\n This is effectively holding money back from our families, which I also don’t feel very comfortable with, but we’re going to be merchants. If we give our families preferential treatment like that, we won’t be able to make a living in commerce anytime soon.\n\n\n After I explain it to him, Lutz stares down at the ground for a while, but soon he firmly raises his head.\n\n\n “…I’ll give it a try.”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Since I’m the one who’ll be making the flower parts, the thread for doing so should go in my house, so Lutz carries it all the way up to our door. This is only natural, but my entire family is so shocked by the fact that we’ve come home with such a huge quantity of thread that they stop working on their winter preparations.\n\n\n “Lutz, what’s all this thread for?”\n\n\n Hey, you know, why are you asking Lutz that and not your own daughter?\n\n\n Grumbling about our difference in reliability, I offer an explanation anyway.\n\n\n “This is the thread for making hairpins. Since Benno’s going to buy the finished product from us, he bought the thread for us in advance. This is the raw materials for my winter handiwork, so don’t just use it on your own!”\n\n\n “I understand,” says my mother. “Thanks again, Lutz. Here, eat this, it’s tasty!”\n\n\n She hands Lutz a small bottle, filled with the jam she’s just finished. Lutz gladly accepts it, smiling brilliantly, and then leaves for home with a bounce in his step.\n\n\n “I’ll get this into the storeroom,” says my father, “so Maine, get to bed.”\n\n\n He picks up the basket full of thread to bring to the storeroom, shooing me briskly towards the bedroom.\n\n\n “Urgh, at least let me wash off first! I didn’t get to yesterday, and I went out today too so now I feel really gross.”\n\n\n “Perfect timing,” says Tory, “the water’s just starting to get hot. I wanted to get clean too, so I’ll bring it in for you.”\n\n\n “Thanks, Tory.”\n\n\n For the last year, I’ve been regularly wiping ourselves down to get clean, along with Tory. Lately, she’s started feeling bothered whenever she goes more than three days without washing off. She sets things up for bathing in the bedroom in the spot that’s closest to the stove and thus the warmest. As she washes herself off, she starts speaking with an earnest tone.\n\n\n “Maine, last year you didn’t know how to do anything at all, so I was super surprised when you found yourself a job all by yourself, you know.”\n\n\n “Are you making baskets this year, too?” I ask, soaking a towel into the bucket and then wringing it out.\n\n\n Tory moves her pleated hair out of the way, wiping down the area around her scalp, while explaining her plans to me.\n\n\n “Yeah. Mom’s work is worth way more than I can make from the handiwork at my job. I’m going to be cutting up the wood we’ll need for making baskets from now on, and peeling all the bark off.”\n\n\n “Oh, really? You don’t absolutely have to do the handiwork from your own job?”\n\n\n Was she not assigned anything to do by the master of her workshop? I tilt my head curiously to the side, since I’d heard from Benno that they worked on a quota. Tory chuckles quietly.\n\n\n “It’s just pocket money. There’s other people that make a lot, and some people are also busy making clothes for their families, so it’s not mandatory, you know?”\n\n\n “Aaah, so everyone’s got their own deal.”\n\n\n I thought that I could get Tory to help me out after she’d filled her own quota, but if she doesn’t really have to actually meet a quota, then I wonder if there isn’t any problem with having her help me right from the start?\n\n\n I briefly look over at her, smiling broadly.\n\n\n “What I’m making this year is hairpins, like the one I made for you. I can make two medium copper coins for each one I make like that.”\n\n\n “Huh?! Really?! That’s a lot of money, isn’t it? Can I help too?”\n\n\n “Yeah, let’s work together!”\n\n\n When I say that, Tory gets really happy and excited. Her eyes brighten at the thought that if she makes a lot of them, she can get some pocket money.\n\n\n “Hey, hey, Maine. Can I do anything to help prepare?”\n\n\n “Mister Benno already got us all the thread, and Lutz is making the pins, so we don’t need to do any more preparing. As long as we’ve got thin needles, we should be fine.”\n\n\n “This’ll be super nice if we don’t have to do any groundwork first,” she says, laughing gleefully to herself.\n\n\n Her smile suddenly freezes. She blinks her eyes once, then points at something behind me. When I turn my head around to see what’s the matter, I see my mother standing behind me, scowling, tapping one hand against her cheek, thinking about something with a profoundly serious look on her face.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine. Once I’m done with your new dress, I can help too, right?”\n\n\n Lutz, what do we do now?\n\n\n My mother’s getting fired up.\n\n\n We might need more pins."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n While I idly laze about in my bed, my fever returns, just like Lutz predicted. This fever, brought on by exhaustion, is mild, so all that happens is that my whole body feels heavy. Since this isn’t the all-consuming fever of the devouring, I should be able to cure it with plenty of quiet bed rest.\n\n\n That, at least, has been what I’ve been thinking over the past three days. Although I’m getting increasingly irritated about my unbroken fever, I get scolded whenever I try to leave my bed on my own, so even though I’m sluggish from oversleeping I can’t do anything but stay in bed.\n\n\n …Aaaaaargh, so bored.\n\n\n Today is pig-slaughtering day. Unlike last year, I’ve managed to gain enough of my family’s confidence that they’re letting me stay here and watch the house by myself, so the headed out for that early in the morning. They made a sandwich for my lunch and filled everyone’s cups with water and left them in the bedroom for me so that I would neither get too hungry nor get too thirsty without any way to deal with it.\n\n\n In this dead-silent bedroom, I technically could move around if I wanted to, but I know that all that would do for me is make my fever linger even longer, so I don’t have any choice but to stay quietly in bed. However, with nobody to even talk to, there’s no helping it: I am so, so bored.\n\n\n If only I had a book…\n\n\n I have a tremendous quantity of failed prototype paper with me, but I still haven’t used it. All it’s been doing since I’ve brought it home has been sitting in the box at the foot of my bed, neatly stacked to one side, gathering dust. Ever since we successfully finished our prototype, I’ve simultaneously been really busy and really fired up about wanting to make my first book.\n\n\n Above all, though, since these are failed prototypes, both the material quality and sizes are all over the place. While I do have some paper that’s almost successful, I also have pieces that are such total failures that are badly ripped or crumbling to pieces. There’s paper that’s so thin that it’s nearly see-through, to the point where I’m almost scared to touch it, and paper that we reinforced so much that it looks brittle enough to break.\n\n\n Out of the pieces that were almost perfect, the ones that got twisted when we tried to paste them up to dry out are still probably the easiest to use. If I were more skilled with my knife, I might be able to use the sheets that dried successfully but we couldn’t remove without ripping big holes in them, but cutting out only the pieces of the page that are actually usable proved to be surprisingly difficult. I really want a tiny, slender blade with a very sharp cutting edge, like a hobby knife. That would be much easier to cut with.\n\n\n I think that if I wanted to make a book with this paper it would take a considerable amount of time. This winter I’ll have a lot of extremely productive free time, it seems.\n\n\n …Ah! Now that I think about it, even if I don’t have a book, I have the board that Mister Benno gave me.\n\n\n I remember that, before my fever flared up, Benno told me that I should look this over when I returned home. I think that I’ll probably be fine if I read it while lying in bed.\n\n\n I get up unsteadily, open the box that I keep my clothes in, and retrieve the approximately A4-sized board from my tote bag. Flopping back down on the bed, I start to read.\n\n\n “This is… the outline of a training course for new employees.”\n\n\n It contains a listing of the minimum amount of knowledge that it’s been decided that newly-entering apprentices should be taught. To break the contents down into broad categories, apprentices will need to know:\n\n\n *How to look after their appearance and give proper greetings.\n\n\n *How to write all of the fundamental letters and numbers.\n\n\n *How to use a calculator.\n\n\n *How to perform monetary exchanges to a certain degree.\n\n\n *The list of commodities in which the shop trades.\n\n\n *The names of the merchants that associate with the shop.\n\n\n “Hmmm, the things the two of us can study ourselves are… writing, math, and monetary exchanges, I think. Everything below that is probably going to be taught to all of the new employees during training, so I think we can put it off for now…”\n\n\n As I monologue, mumbling, I start making study plans for the winter.\n\n\n First off, I wonder how many of the fundamental letters and numbers Lutz remembers? I taught them to him a while ago, but they’re the kind of things that you tend to forget if you don’t use. I’ll need to verify what he’s forgotten, then teach those to him again. Instead of practice sentences, I wonder how well it would work if I had him write out order forms, formal introductions, and so on? They’re full of vocabulary words that he’ll need for work, so I don’t think there’s much harm there.\n\n\n To be perfectly honest, I actually don’t know how to write many words that aren’t strictly work-related. Here, there’s no dictionary, and the words that have been taught to me were either drilled into me by Otto so that I could help him with the budget or are merchant-related ones taught to me by Benno or Mark. I think I’ve got a solid grasp on my work-related vocabulary. However, I don’t know how to write any common nouns or verbs.\n\n\n “As for using calculators, I know how to add and subtract, but I’ve never asked Mark about how to do multiplication or division on them so I don’t know that yet, hmmm…”\n\n\n I can work out all sorts of calculations by hand on my slate, but it’s essential for me to learn how to be able to use a calculator, too. In order to avoid standing out too much from the other apprentices, I should be able to do things the same way that everyone else does.\n\n\n “I really want to teach Lutz first- through third-grade arithmetic, but I don’t have either textbooks or workbooks, so teaching him is going to be really tough. Since I have to prioritize, I think the counting system and doing large monetary conversions is probably the biggest priority, and then getting him to do addition and subtraction, at least in the ones digit. Then, we can move on to the general concepts of multiplication and division… wait, can we actually do this over the winter?”\n\n\n Drilling in how to work with numbers takes three years, so of course doing all of it over the course of a single winter is impossible.\n\n\n As I let out a heavy sigh, I notice that my fever is wriggling around inside me, a pressure building up like it’s about to burst open. I press my fingertips into my temples, gritting my teeth.\n\n\n I don’t actually scream “don’t come out,” though.\n\n\n Imagining tightly screwing on a lid, I shut it back away, then breathe a sigh of relief. It hadn’t been for very long, but fighting against the devouring has actually made me hungry. I reach over and pick up the sandwich my family had left for me. I take a big bite then, while I chew noisily, start thinking about personal appearance and greetings.\n\n\n “Now this is the biggest problem: looking after our appearance and giving proper greetings. Neither of us really know to what extent a merchant needs to prepare their appearance, or what kind of greetings and phrases are unique to merchants, if any…”\n\n\n I have some idea of what the work clothes, which we will have to buy, are like, having seen the various employees at both Benno’s shop and the Merchant’s Guild. I have no idea how much any of that would actually cost, so I’ll need to verify that with Benno later.\n\n\n As for the greetings, those are on the list of things I want someone to teach me. I already know that people here don’t ever greet each other by bowing, but I don’t know what the correct way to greet someone in the merchant world actually is. All I’ve seen is people smiling at others who they’ve just met while lying through their teeth. Although, I have a hunch that neither Benno nor the guild leader had been doing any sort of typical greeting.\n\n\n At some point, while I was staring at the board I got from Benno and thinking hard, I gradually drifted off to sleep again. When I wake up, I see my family’s already returned home, and are busy bringing their various pork products into the storage room.\n\n\n “Welcome back,” I say.\n\n\n “Oh, hello, Maine! Did we wake you? How are you feeling?”\n\n\n “…Better, I think.”\n\n\n Now that I’m awake, I actually feel very refreshed, so I think my fever’s gone down. Tomorrow, I’ll still be staying at home so we can wait and see, but the day after tomorrow I think I’ll be able to move around again.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, Lutz, with a basket strapped to his back, stops by to pay me a visit on his way to the forest. Although my fever’s gone down, today’s another day in which I shouldn’t be leaving my bed, so I’m extremely happy to have someone to talk to, even if it’s only for a little bit.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine! I heard you’re feeling better? Tory told me a little while ago, when she met me downstairs.”\n\n\n “Yeah, since last night. I’m staying home all day today to make sure, but tomorrow I think I’ll be able to go out.”\n\n\n “Oh, okay! It’s been a long time since you’ve been sick for so long, I was worried.”\n\n\n It seems that both Lutz and my family have been very worried, since I haven’t had a fever that’s lasted this long in quite some time.\n\n\n “You missed helping prepare the pork this year, too.”\n\n\n “Ahhh, it just can’t be helped, this time of year.”\n\n\n I’ve slowly become more-or-less used to going to the butcher’s and seeing chickens get sliced up, but there’s no way I can go along with the rest of the family thinking that I’m going to enjoy this once-per-year experience. I still can’t even make myself want to participate. I actually caught myself thinking that I was so lucky that it came and went while I was still stuck in bed with a fever.\n\n\n “Yesterday,” I say, “I looked over the board that Mister Benno left us and put together an education plan for us. Tomorrow, I’d like to go to Mister Benno’s shop, return this board, and ask him if I could buy a calculator, maybe…”\n\n\n “…Oh, that’s right, what’s on that board, anyway?”\n\n\n Lutz claps his hands together, apparently having only just remembered that the board even existed, and leans forward curiously. He looks like he’s ready to listen to every word.\n\n\n “It’s related to the education apprentices get. Lutz, how much of your letters and numbers do you think you remember?”\n\n\n “All the ones you taught me…?” he says, tilting his head doubtfully at me like the answer was obvious.\n\n\n Startled, I open my eyes wide. I didn’t expect in the slightest that he’d completely remember everything.\n\n\n “What? Really?! You don’t usually use them, but you haven’t forgotten any?!”\n\n\n “…Well, you know, it’s so rare for someone to be able to teach me things, so once I finally learned how to write, I didn’t want to forget, so I kept writing on the ground or the wall with my finger, and then after I bought my slate I’ve been practicing on that ever since.”\n\n\n “Lutz, that’s amazing!”\n\n\n Lutz is an even harder worker than I thought. Wait, no; I’ve still been thinking that it’s only natural that people get educated, and that it’s easy to get any information you want whenever you want it. I wonder if this is too naive? I’ve never actually thought about not wanting to learn knowledge that I’d finally received. After all, if I ever forgot it, I could just get a book and read about it again. If I just remembered what kind of books I can find things in, then I could easily obtain, on demand, any information that I wanted. I’ve never had a need to memorize the entire contents of it before.\n\n\n “Nah, I’m not amazing at all. You’re the amazing one, being able to read really large numbers like you can.”\n\n\n “Then, I can teach you how to read big numbers too! Pick up that slate.”\n\n\n I teach him about the ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, and ever-larger digits. The town marketplace uses three-digit numbers, so he can read those easily, but it seems he doesn’t understand numbers larger than that. Holding the slate in place, I run through the digits until Lutz starts counting along with me. After reading them aloud many times, I write up a series of suitably large numbers on the slate.\n\n\n “Alright, question one. How do you read 78,946,215?”\n\n\n “Ummm, one, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand, million, ten million, so…”\n\n\n Lutz tackles each problem earnestly and, in no time at all, starts to be able to read numbers up to the ten millions. I wonder what’s higher, his memory or his concentration skills? Lutz’s specs are way higher than I thought they’d be. We’ll be able to put a ton of effort into studying this winter.\n\n\n If he’s this smart… there’s not actually a single thing I can actually beat him in, is there?\n\n\n As I start feeling a little sorry for myself, Tory comes back up from downstairs, bringing a bucket of water from the well with her. When she sees Lutz, she shouts in surprise.\n\n\n “What the… Lutz?! Weren’t you supposed to go to the forest? Everyone else left already, you know?!”\n\n\n “Yikes! Sorry, Maine. I gotta go! Thanks for teaching me!”\n\n\n Panicking, Lutz shoots to his feet, then dashes out the door. At that speed, he should be able to catch up to everyone else well before they even reach the gate.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, my family grants me permission to leave the house, so Lutz and I head out to Benno’s shop in the afternoon, when he has the free time to meet with us. However, when we arrive, the entrance is closed, and a single guard stands quietly outside.\n\n\n “Huh?” I say. “I guess it’s still lunchtime…”\n\n\n “Want to go back to the central square and sit down for a bit? Standing around the whole time would be really hard, right?”\n\n\n “Yeah, you’re right. Finding someplace to sit down sounds like a really good idea right now.”\n\n\n As the two of us discuss how we’re going to kill the time, the guard beckons to us, as if he’s completely recognized our faces.\n\n\n “I’ll go ask the master if it’s okay to let you two in. Would please you wait here for a moment?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir, and thank you!”\n\n\n The guard disappears into the shop, then immediately returns, opening the door wide to let us in. Inside, the shop is gloomy with the windows and doors shut. He leads us briskly back to the office in the back and opens the door. Inside, the sunlight streams brightly in through the window, and a brilliant fire burns within the hearth.\n\n\n “Maine, are you feeling better now?”\n\n\n Benno, who seems to have been in the middle of some work, sets aside his pen and ink and stands to greet us.\n\n\n “Yes, sir. I’ve come to return this board to you. I also have some questions I’d like to ask, is that okay?”\n\n\n “Sure, go ahead. I’ve got some things I’d like to talk with you about too, but you two go first.”\n\n\n Benno gestures to the table we usually sit at, and prompts me to begin.\n\n\n “Thank you very much for lending me this,” I say. “Thanks to it, I was able to form some ideas about a plan for studying during the winter.”\n\n\n “Oh?”\n\n\n “Ummm, as I was reading it, a few questions occurred to me. I understand that taking care of our appearance and giving proper greetings is necessary, but to what degree do we need to take care of our appearance? Also, if merchants have any specific greetings or phrases, unfortunately neither of us actually know them.”\n\n\n “Ahh,” he says, studying us carefully.\n\n\n “To start with, although you two are commoners living near the south gate, you aren’t grungy at all, so all you need to worry about is your work clothes. You can get the minimum for about ten small silver coins, so if you start saving now, then by the summer you could probably afford it.”\n\n\n “Ten small silver coins…,” mumbles Lutz, dumbfounded. “I’m so glad I copied Maine and saved some away…”\n\n\n To Lutz, whose mother spins thread and makes all of the clothes for her family, the concept of spending ten small silver coins on clothing and shoes comes as an enormous shock. I’m shocked as well, but clothing here is not something you get off the shelf. It’s all made to order, so I thought that the price was going to be something around those lines. It’s definitely very expensive, but it’s still something that we could buy if we work very hard come springtime to earn money making paper.\n\n\n “Next is your manner of speech. Maine, you’re okay, but Lutz, you need work. You need to learn how to speak politely, otherwise I can’t put you out in front of customers the way you talk now.”\n\n\n Lutz, having been singled out, is at a loss for words. Picking up how to speak politely is really difficult if nobody around him does it either. I try to think about who the best person for him to imitate would be, out of all the people we know.\n\n\n “You could use Mister Mark as a reference for speaking politely.”\n\n\n “…Urrrgh, it makes me really kinda… itchy, though.”\n\n\n I can sympathize with the unstable sort of feeling of being suddenly told to change one’s manner of speech to something that’s entirely unlike yourself. However, if he’s unable to do so, he won’t be able to stand out in the front of the shop. This is doubly true in Benno’s shop, which is rapidly growing its base of noble clientele. If we want to climb to the top, we absolutely need to learn how to manage our appearance, our speech, and our manners.\n\n\n “That’s okay,” I reassure him. “You can do it if you try! You know how Benno usually talks one way, then in front of customers he’s suddenly speaking very politely? It would be great if you could do the same thing when you’re dealing with customers, too.”\n\n\n Even though I’ve never actually seen Benno switch to a more polite manner of speech, even when talking to the guild leader, I’m certain that if he thought he had to, he could do it in a heartbeat. Otherwise, he’d be a terrible fit for a merchant.\n\n\n “There’s no real need for you to talk super politely to me or your family, you know? Also, when I’m talking with the guild leader or Mister Benno, I use different words than I do when I’m talking to you, right? Does that make you itchy. too?”\n\n\n “Now that you say that… nah, I guess not. You talk normally to me, so I guess I never really noticed.”\n\n\n If you can smoothly switch between modes, it’s not something you ever notice. Even if you start out being uncomfortable with it, as you keep using polite speech, you rapidly become used to it.\n\n\n “So, for the words you’re going to be using just at work, why don’t you try practicing how Mister Mark speaks? Start with things like addressing people as ‘sir’ and 'ma'am’ and using 'please’ and 'thank you’ more often… I believe that would best, wouldn’t you agree?”\n\n\n As I switch to more polite phrasing for the last sentence, Lutz nods in comprehension.\n\n\n “Yeah, sounds good, sir!”\n\n\n “Argh, no! I’m a girl, say 'ma'am’!”\n\n\n “Snrk! Gaahahahaha!”\n\n\n Benno, having watched our exchange, erupts in a belly-bursting laugh, slapping the table uproariously, wiping tears from his eyes and clutching his sides.\n\n\n “Ahaha… well, I have no idea how far you two can get over the winter, but keep at it, kids.”\n\n\n He shows no sign of calming down, so I peer at him in mild disapproval, though it doesn’t seem to do much. I clench my fist tightly, resolving that we’re going to make so much progress this winter that he’ll be shocked. This jogs my memory, and I remember the favor I wanted to ask of him.\n\n\n “Ah, that’s right! Mister Benno?”\n\n\n “What’s up?”\n\n\n “I’d like a calculator so that I can work on learning how to use it. If I can’t practice, I won’t be able to really master it.”\n\n\n Mark is capable of using his calculator very quickly, flicking beads around with his fingers while simultaneously thinking of the next steps. I probably won’t be able to get quite as good as him, but for things like abacuses, practice is very important.\n\n\n “A calculator, hmm… If a secondhand one from my shop is alright with you, I can sell it for six large copper coins. How does that sound? Can the two of you share one?”\n\n\n “Yes sir, thank you very much.”\n\n\n Lutz and I tap our guild cards together with Benno’s, agreeing to pay him three coins each. He then gives us our new calculator.\n\n\n “We’ll be able to study math with this, Lutz.”\n\n\n “Yeah,” he replies.\n\n\n “Did you have anything else you wanted to ask?” says Benno.\n\n\n Something immediately flashes to mind.\n\n\n “Ah, I’ll need to order a new contract sheet-sized paper frame before springtime, if that’s not too much trouble…”\n\n\n “Just fill out an order form. Mark already knows what you’re looking for, he can go handle it.”\n\n\n “Huh? But…”\n\n\n When we’d been going around to various places to place our orders, Mark had told us that if we weren’t there ourselves to describe what we wanted, there’s no telling what kind of trouble we might get ourselves into. I don’t think leaving it all to him is the best idea.\n\n\n “I’ve got something else I need you to do for me. Hey, just write it down, okay?”\n\n\n Urged onwards, I draw my ordering set out of my tote bag. By now, I’m down to a single board that I can use for ordering.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, it seems that I’m running out of boards for order forms…”\n\n\n “Yeah, you’ve done a lot of ordering, haven’t you. I’ll get you some more.”\n\n\n “Whoa! I’ve almost run out of ink, too!”\n\n\n Not only have I written a lot of orders, but when we were working on our prototypes, it was necessary for me to use even more ink in order to test how easy it was to write on the paper. I’ve used quite a lot of it by now.\n\n\n When I say that, Benno’s face tightens sharply. “…I want to charge you for this, but… well, whatever. I’ll call this part of my initial investment.”\n\n\n I’m a little shocked by this. Otto had said that ink was very expensive and thus not a child’s plaything. However, I’d never heard how much it actually cost.\n\n\n Timidly, I ask, “If you’ll pardon the digression, might I ask how much a bottle of ink would cost?”\n\n\n “About four small silver coins each.”\n\n\n “Eek?!”\n\n\n Lutz and I couldn’t afford it even if we scraped together everything we’ve saved so far!\n\n\n “Use it carefully,” he warns me.\n\n\n “Y… yes, sir. Of course!”\n\n\n I’d been thinking that I wanted some ink of my own to use for my book-making project, but I think I’ll have to give up on trying to buy it. Using my leftover soot pencils is probably my best bet.\n\n\n My pen scratches at the surface of the board as I write out my order. I’m very used to this by now. The tip of the pen quickly dulls, but Lutz immediately sharpens it again for me. I ask Benno to get an average-sized contract for me, use my tape measure to determine its size, and finish writing out the rest of the order.\n\n\n Benno looks over my completed form, then nods slightly.\n\n\n “No mistakes or spelling errors at all. I’ll get this over to Mark. …Maine, if you don’t get that paper frame and can’t make any paper, I’ll be in just as much trouble as you. Don’t worry about it, I’ll make sure it’s done right.”\n\n\n “Thank you very much, sir.”\n\n\n I’m relieved to hear Benno say that he’ll take responsibility for making sure it’ll be made correctly. Breathing out slowly, I tidy up my ordering set.\n\n\n “…Is that all you wanted to talk about, you two?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir,” I say, nodding emphatically.\n\n\n Benno sits up straight, his expression going serious. Guessing that this is going to be a discussion about some sort of transaction, Lutz and I straighten up as well.\n\n\n “Well then, I’ve got something I’d like to ask as well. Maine, it’s about the hair-washing liquid you taught me how to make.”\n\n\n “What is it?”\n\n\n I’d explained how to make it quite a ways back, when we were still in the middle of prototyping our paper, on one of the days where we were borrowing the key for the warehouse. I should have already told him everything. Since I’ve already relinquished all of my rights to it thanks to the contract magic, I have no idea whatsoever about what he could possibly have to ask after all this time. As I study him curiously, my head tilted to the side, his expression grows increasingly troubled as he opens his mouth to speak.\n\n\n “You told me that melil oil is best oil to use, so I’ve been gathering it until now, but…”\n\n\n “Huh? Shouldn’t melil be almost out of season? Have you not made anything yet?”\n\n\n Lutz and I exchange glances. Melil should be about out of season. The two of us had gathered a lot of it already and made it all into simple shampoo. I would have thought that Benno, who is constantly seeking profit, would have started production a long time ago and would have sold a large quantity of it since then.\n\n\n “Well, I’d acquired a large crop of them, and had a workshop start making it, but the other day they came to me and said that it wasn’t coming out right, even if they made it exactly the way you said. Can you think of any reason that might be?”\n\n\n I frown as I think about what he said. Fundamentally, the entire procedure boils down to just smashing, then pressing, then mixing in scents. I can’t think of any place in the process that could actually go wrong. I tilt my head to the side in confusion, as does Lutz, who has helped me make shampoo countless times.\n\n\n “…Even if they’re saying it’s not turning out right, if you’re making simple shampoo, then… it’s not a very difficult process, is it?”\n\n\n “I know, right?”\n\n\n I have a ton of ideas on how to make it better, if I only had the ingredients, but in its current simple form, I can’t think of a reason why it would ever fail. It always turned out the same no matter if it was me, Tory, or Lutz who was making it.\n\n\n “I really didn’t want to bring you out, but if we don’t manage to complete this, then this will turn into something the contract magic would have to deal with. Sorry, but could you come with me to the workshop?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir!” I reply.\n\n\n If I recall correctly, the penalties for violating a magical contract are very severe. In the worst case, they could even mean death. As soon as I cutely chirp out my immediate response, though, Lutz grabs hold of my arm.\n\n\n “Maine, I think you should probably stop for today. Your fever’s only barely just gone back down, and you’re not all the way back to normal, right?”\n\n\n Lutz is correct, but in this season there’s not going to be a whole lot of time where I’m actually at peak health. This is definitely a season where my fever could flare up at any point, if I’m even just a little bit unprepared. If just not having a fever doesn’t count as being healthy, then I’d never be able to leave my house for anything.\n\n\n “But I don’t know how long it’ll take me to get totally healthy again, and if we let this go for too long then the snow is going to start falling, so we should go now, while my fever’s down, right?”\n\n\n “Well, you’re not wrong, but…”\n\n\n Benno pats Lutz’s worried head reassuringly. “Don’t worry too much, Lutz. I’ll carry her, so we won’t be making her walk. Not like I can stand walking that slowly, anyway.”\n\n\n “…Well, in that case, I guess it’s okay, huh?”\n\n\n With that, Benno picks me up once again, and we head out.\n\n\n He asked me about what could have caused the failure, but I’ve never actually seen this fail before.\n\n\n I wonder if he really understood me?"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The three of us make our way towards the workshop where they’re making simple shampoo, with me being held in Benno’s arms. Along the way, Benno asks me a question that seems to be a just a little difficult for him to verbalize.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine. About that hair-washing liquid…”\n\n\n “Yes? What about the ‘simple all-in-one shampoo and conditioner’?”\n\n\n “That name’s too long and hard to say. Is there something else we can call it?”\n\n\n It certainly is a long name for this world, especially when the people here, like Benno, don’t actually understand the meaning of the underlying Japanese and know it only by sound. So, in other words, he’s asking for a name for this new commodity that would be easier for his noble clientele to pronounce.\n\n\n I blink, surprised, then nod at him with a smile. “Ohhh, I just called it that on a whim when Tory wanted to know what it was, and it stuck, so I don’t particularly care what we call it?”\n\n\n “…Is that so?”\n\n\n At the time, I was so happy that my head was no longer so itchy and that my hair had gone from rustlingly dry to silky smooth that I just called it whatever came to mind. I didn’t really put any thought into it.\n\n\n “Yes, sir. Please feel free to call it whatever you’d like.”\n\n\n “You say that, but that just creates new problems…”\n\n\n Benno frowns, eyebrows drawn together, as he thinks. Naming an entirely new product requires really good instinct, I think. Thinking that he might need a little help, I keep speaking, hoping to give him a little hint.\n\n\n “We should probably think of this like a brand name. I think it would be best if it were something easy to say and easy to understand. Perhaps instead of finding words that describe what it does, like \"hair-washing liquid” or “cleanser”, should we describe the results, like how it makes hair glossy and silky?“\n\n\n \"Hmmm… hmmm…”\n\n\n As I list off ideas, Benno’s expression grows even more and more grim. I wonder if, instead of giving hints, I was stressing him out?\n\n\n Benno’s eyebrows are deeply furrowed, but Lutz just shrugs lightly.\n\n\n “Since I’ve been saying 'sim-pull ah-rin-won sham-pooh und kun-dishner’ all this time, I think it’s probably fine?”\n\n\n “Maine,” says Benno, “Is there… anything… else you’d call it?”\n\n\n Having perhaps completely failed to come up with any suitable words, Benno looks down at me, seeking help. Since I’ve been referring to it as “simple all-in-one shampoo and conditioner” this entire time, I can’t just arbitrarily come up with some other name for it when prompted. There are similar Japanese words I can use, but that’s not going to change the fact that nobody in this world will understand what they mean.\n\n\n “Ummm? I can’t really think of anything, besides something like 'rinse-in shampoo’…?”\n\n\n “…So 'rin’, 'sham’, and 'poo’ are necessary, huh?”\n\n\n “No, um, not really, but I think whatever you come up with would be much…”\n\n\n Benno mumbles to himself for a while, but in the end, maybe because he couldn’t come up with a name that worked, or maybe because “simple all-in-one shampoo and conditioner” is already fixed in his head, or maybe he even just made a decision based on my second suggestion, he decides on just calling it “rinsham”.\n\n\n Uh… is that going to be okay?\n\n\n ***\n\n\n When we pass through the central square, Benno turns to walk towards the west. I blink in surprise; I would have thought that, since this is a workshop for pressing oil, it would be on the streets where the other craftsmen are.\n\n\n “Are there workshops on the west side as well? I thought it would be where the other craftsmen work.”\n\n\n “There’s workshops that handle more foodstuffs over there. They have a lot of things coming and going, so being close to the west gate is ideal for them.”\n\n\n “Ah, right, melil fruit is a foodstuff. I’ve only really been using it to make rinsham, lately…”\n\n\n When I had been at my wits’ end with how constantly my head was itching and desperately wanting to wash it, I hadn’t considered even for a moment that the simple shampoo I was making would have become a commodity. At the start, I was just thinking about what I could actually use, seeing as how I neither had any seaweed nor could use water after washing rice with it. I searched through my memory for everything I knew about shampoo, recalling various magazines about things like natural lifestyles and naturalism, trying to remember everything I could about using natural ingredients in beauty products.\n\n\n From my memories, I remembered that you could make a shampoo by using plant-based oils coupled with salt or powdered orange peel to use as a scrub. I also remembered that you could make a facial by whipping egg whites until they’re firm, a lotion out of dried plums and sake, and a whole lot of other things, but I didn’t really need either of those things for a child’s soft skin. The pressing necessity was finding raw materials for a shampoo.\n\n\n …Although getting the oil was tremendously difficult.\n\n\n I’d wandered around the kitchen, searching for things that might contain oils, and discovered the somewhat avocado-like melil that had been put out on the kitchen table. I thought that it might have oil in it, but I didn’t at the time know what it was actually called, so I couldn’t go and get more of it, and my head was itchy, so everything was terrible. Since curing my itchy scalp was such a pressing necessity, I constantly begged Tory to go get me more of them, not knowing in the slightest how difficult gathering things from the forest actually was. Thanks to that, my scalp was soothed, and, having brought gloss and silkiness back to my hair, I could focus in earnest on building a more hygienic lifestyle for myself.\n\n\n Tory, thank you!\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The workshop that Benno brings me to is something like a large warehouse. Just as I had heard about workshops that did a lot of work with foodstuffs, various smells drifted through the air, mingling together. Various workbenches were lined up throughout the workshop, with different benches seemingly set up for different tasks. Along the walls, shelves are set up for storing tools, with all sorts of different implements visible on them.\n\n\n Benno catches one of the workmen. “Is the master here? Tell him Benno’s come.”\n\n\n The workman, panicking, lets out a strangled “yes!” and runs off. Benno sets me down, and we wait for the master of the workshop to arrive. Shortly, a slightly plump older man, having been called by the workman from earlier, emerges from further back, his belly swaying as he walks.\n\n\n At first glance, he’s very much a man in charge of someplace that makes food. He has the physique of a man who, from the bottom of his heart, loves to eat. If this were Japan, he’d only be thought of as a little fat, but in this city where food is not overly abundant, a belly like that is considered to be quite fat indeed.\n\n\n “Master Benno, thank you so much for walking all the way out here. …May I ask who these children are?”\n\n\n “These are the kids that originally figured out how to make rinsham. I’d appreciate it if you didn’t tell anyone.”\n\n\n Benno’s eyes sharpen dangerously as he speaks. The workshop master rapidly nods many times in agreement.\n\n\n “So,” says Benno, “have you fixed the problem?”\n\n\n “No; we’ve changed the tools we’re using, changed the people making it, and a whole bunch of other things, but I have a feeling that we’re starting to get pretty far off the mark.”\n\n\n Benno can’t conceal his irritation that no progress was being made. When I see how greatly embarrassed the workshop master is, I suddenly feel like I’m somehow being scolded along with him.\n\n\n I tug on his sleeve. “Umm, would it be possible for me to see how you’re making this?”\n\n\n “Sure. …If you notice anything wrong, it’d be a huge help if you could teach me about it. For some reason, the stuff we’re making here doesn’t actually seem to clean anything.”\n\n\n He leads us to the corner where they make rinsham, and he shows me their process. Since he doesn’t want to waste any resources on another failure, he uses a single melil fruit. He places a heavy weight on top of the fruit, and crushes it in a single instant. It’s very different than how Tory and Lutz squeeze out oil by using a hammer. Next, the foreman picks up the cloth underneath it, then tightly wrings it out, causing oil to drip into a bowl.\n\n\n “This is how we make the oil. You with me so far?”\n\n\n There isn’t a single problem I can see with their oil-extracting process. Lutz mumbles that there’s no room for error there, so there doesn’t seem to be any mistakes, at a glance, with this step of the process.\n\n\n “The two of us couldn’t use a weight to press the oil,” I say, “so we had to use a hammer. However, I don’t think a difference like that would be enough to cause this kind of error.”\n\n\n “Ahh, a kid wouldn’t be strong enough for that, so they’d need to use a hammer, huh.”\n\n\n As the warehouse master mumbles about perhaps trying a hammer next, I make a request.\n\n\n “That oil. Would it be alright if I take a look at the oil you extracted just now?”\n\n\n “Sure.”\n\n\n He hands me the oil bowl. Inside, a clear, green oil, devoid of any impurity, sloshes around.\n\n\n “Ah! Got it.”\n\n\n The instant I see the oil, I realize what’s wrong. On one hand, I’m happy that the problem is so simple, but on the other hand, it’s for such a depressing reason that I almost want to cry.\n\n\n “What?! Were we doing something wrong?!” asks the warehouse master, with such ferocity that I think he might bite my head off.\n\n\n My shoulders drooping a little, I answer. “…It’s the cloth you’re using.”\n\n\n When I say this, Benno shoots a glare at the warehouse master, whose eyes go wide in shock. Grabbing the cloth in both hands, he brandishes it frantically, flapping it around.\n\n\n “The cloth?! This is a brand new operation, so we used the best cloth we could get!”\n\n\n “…That’s the problem.”\n\n\n “What?!”\n\n\n Now it’s not just the warehouse master who’s staring at me in shop, but Benno as well. Shrugging, I set the bowl of oil down on the table.\n\n\n “The fabric that the two of us have at our homes is all very coarse. I’m sure you can see from our clothing, but we don’t have a lot of money. Since we don’t have a finely-woven cloth like this, the oil that we make has a lot of plant fibers and tiny fragments of the seeds mixed in with it.”\n\n\n The oil that Tory and Lutz press isn’t a clear green like this, but whitish and cloudy. The reason is simple. The cloth we’re using is so rough that it can’t even compare to the one they’re using at this workshop. Also, in order to avoid any waste, we press every last drop we can get out of the fruit, and we wring every last drop out of the cloth without caring too much about any impurities.\n\n\n “Those fragments work as a 'scrub’… ah, I mean, they are necessary for removing any impurities as you’re washing your hair.”\n\n\n Essentially, you can take a pure oil like they’ve made at this workshop and add ground salt, nuts, and dried citrus peel in order to make a scrub. However, in our case, the oil itself already worked just fine as a scrub. To make things worse, my lifestyle isn’t one where I can talk about adding more things to it. The best I could do was mix the large quantity of herbs I gathered from the forest in to it to make it smell better.\n\n\n The workshop master seems befuddled by my explanation, his mouth hanging open. It seems the source of the problem was vastly outside his expectations. It wasn’t what I was expecting, either. For the final product to deviate so much from the sample just because of the decision to use good-quality oil… I bet he’s sick to his stomach.\n\n\n Benno, having understood the source of the problem, lets out a sigh of relief. He picks up the squeezing cloth with his fingertips, then shrugs.\n\n\n “Never would have thought it was the cloth. For something to fail just because we’re using a high quality thing… I’d thought that there was some sort of trick to mixing the herbs in.”\n\n\n “The herbs are basically just there for the scent.”\n\n\n The warehouse master breathes an enormous sigh of relief. With an expression that’s somewhere between relieved and troubled, he whispers to himself.\n\n\n “If we need a rougher cloth, the stuff we’ve pressed so far is useless, huh…”\n\n\n “Um?” I say. “You can use it, you know? It would be a waste if you didn’t.”\n\n\n “Eh?”\n\n\n If I could, a pure, high-quality oil like this would actually be what I’d want to use. If you added a scrub to this, then you’d wind up with a product of much higher quality than the rinsham that I was making.\n\n\n “All you need to do is add a 'scrub’ to the oil you’ve got so far. If you pick your ingredients carefully, you could make something much higher quality than what I made.”\n\n\n “Oh,” says the warehouse master, impressed. “Young lady, you’re quite knowledgeable, aren’t you?”\n\n\n As the warehouse master looks at me praisingly, I notice that Benno’s eyes are suddenly gleaming with a terrifying light, like he’s just spotted fresh prey.\n\n\n “Um…”\n\n\n Sh*t. I got carried away and said too much. All the blood drains from my face. I glance over at Lutz, who is staring at me with an expression so amazed that he doesn’t even have to say what a huge idiot I am. This is exactly what happened when I accidentally let too much information slip to him, earlier.\n\n\n Aaaaaargh! I’m a colossal idiot! Am I even capable of learning?!\n\n\n The corners of my mouth twitch slowly into place as I try to paste a smile onto my face.\n\n\n Calm down, calm down, I still haven’t leaked anything, everything’s just fine.\n\n\n “If you add anything rough to the mixture, there’s a chance it could injure someone’s scalp when they’re washing, so please be careful about that.”\n\n\n Smiling, I try to make a quick escape, but Benno clamps down hard on my shoulder, a ferocious grin on his face.\n\n\n “It looks like you know about quite a lot of other things, don’t you?”\n\n\n I do know a lot more, but I cannot let myself say anything else lest something slip out. From now on, I want to live a calm, tranquil life here, so Benno having strange suspicions about me would be very problematic. Somehow, I have to escape from Benno’s interrogation.\n\n\n Since Benno didn’t know the previous Maine, he won’t have the same sort of mistrust that Lutz did, so the conditions are different this time. If I try hard enough, I think I should be able to manage. I’ll show him somehow.\n\n\n Although my back grows cold with sweat, I refuse to be dominated by the force of Benno’s gaze. I brace my legs, put on my best smile, and bluff as hard as I ever have.\n\n\n “I’ll have to charge for anything more. I’ll need an information fee. That’s all I’ll say for now.”\n\n\n “How much?”\n\n\n Benno smiles broadly, raising his chin a bit, telling me to name my price, but no matter how much he might offer I have no intent on telling him any more. However, if I say that out loud, then negotiations would be over immediately. Right now, I need to figure out how to get Benno to withdraw.\n\n\n My heart pounding furiously in my ears, I frantically shake my head.\n\n\n “…You have a product you can sell already; if you want more, how much are you willing to spend to purchase that information?”\n\n\n I smile sweetly at him, and we lock eyes for a little while. The sheer ferocity in his reddish-brown eyes makes me instinctively want to back down, but there is no way I can give in. I know that no matter what I say, people look at me funny, but I can’t say anything more right now.\n\n\n Benno breaks eye contact, calling out to the warehouse master.\n\n\n “Can we borrow your negotiation room?”\n\n\n “Y… yeah, go right ahead.”\n\n\n The instant the warehouse master replies, Benno grabs hold of me tightly, picks me up, and literally abducts me towards the negotiation room.\n\n\n “Aaaaaah?!”\n\n\n “Maine?!”\n\n\n “We’re just going to talk! Nobody come in!”\n\n\n Lutz staggers as Benno roars, freezing in place. The workshop master nods rapidly in agreement as well.\n\n\n Benno, having forcefully taken over someone else’s negotiation room, sits me down on a chair, then sits facing me. After staring at me for a little while, he opens his mouth.\n\n\n “Two small gold coins.”\n\n\n “…what?”\n\n\n I misheard. I have to have misheard. I’m pretty sure I just heard him offer a tremendous sum, but I definitely have to have misheard.\n\n\n I notice that my jaw has fallen open in shock, but since I’ve obviously just misheard, I frantically compose myself, snapping it shut. When I do so, Benno repeats himself, enunciating very clearly.\n\n\n “I’ll pay two small gold coins. Tell me about any improvements, changes, alternate plants, absolutely everything that you can think of. All of it.”\n\n\n If he’s willing to pay two small gold coins for improvements and changes, I have to wonder just how much he’s estimating that he’ll be able to sell rinsham for. If it’s a luxury good like Freida’s hairpins, is he planning on massively overpricing that too when he sells it to his noble counterparts?\n\n\n “…Mister Benno, just how much are you planning on selling rinsham for?”\n\n\n As I stare back at him, Benno’s eyes narrow slightly.\n\n\n “That’s none of your business,” he scoffs.\n\n\n “But I’m trying to sell you information about how to manufacture it, so it is literally my business, isn’t it?”\n\n\n Convinced that saying that will end the discussion immediately, I breathe a sigh of relief in my heart, and put my hands on the table as I prepare to stand up.\n\n\n “Three small gold coins. Not a copper more.”\n\n\n Benno firmly grabs my hands as soon as I put them on the table, and with a pained expression, raises his price. The eyeball-popping sum of money makes my heart waver, but if he’s unwilling to raise the price any further then negotiations are obviously over. For the sake of my peaceful future, I need to dodge any further investigation.\n\n\n “I must ref…”\n\n\n “Take it and save it. The only thing that can help with the devouring is money.”\n\n\n Just as I was about to decline, Benno suddenly stares at me intently, clenching his jaw and speaking in almost a whisper. My eyes go wide in astonishment.\n\n\n “…Mister Benno, do you know about… the devouring?”\n\n\n “I thought there was a chance, so the other day I had that old bastard tell me everything he knew.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n When Benno says “that old bastard”, he means the guild leader. I wonder what the guild leader told him? Does this have anything to do with the fact that he was a lot less wary around him after we delivered Freida’s hairpins?\n\n\n With a different sort of impatience than before coiling around my heart, the strength leaves my body. Having been halfway out of my seat, my butt lands hard on the wooden chair.\n\n\n Seeing that I’ve sat back down, Benno leans low over the table, bringing his face close to mine, then starts speaking in a voice so low that only I can hear. Strangely, despite the fact that he’s whispering, his voice strikes my eardrum with perfect clarity.\n\n\n “His granddaughter had the devouring too, same as you, but between his money and his connections to the nobility, she was saved. Sell me the information you have and save the money so that you’ll be ready when the day comes.”\n\n\n “And by that you mean…”\n\n\n “When the fever in your body… can’t be kept in check anymore.”\n\n\n Comprehension floods through my body. I had been kind of thinking that the devouring fever was a little more active lately, but I thought it was just my imagination, or that it was because of my physical condition. So, Benno and the guild leader think that someday the devouring fever is going to spread out so wide that I won’t be able to force it back down, huh?\n\n\n When comparing my own life to the risk of being found to be disturbing after giving up this information, the conclusion comes far too quickly.\n\n\n I still don’t want to die.\n\n\n I finally made some paper. I’ve finally managed to create an environment where I can make a book this winter, though it’ll be made out of failed scraps. I’ve gotten used to this lifestyle, and I’ve started getting along really well with my family. I’ve started to discover ways that I can be even just a little useful, despite being so useless all around.\n\n\n I’ve finally started to enjoy living here.\n\n\n I can’t die now.\n\n\n Simultaneously, I consider what would happen if I gave Benno this information and he decided he found me disturbing.\n\n\n If Benno thinks I’m disturbing, what would happen? Unlike Lutz, who knew the previous Maine, all Benno would think is that I’m a child that knows a disturbing amount of strange information. I don’t think that being disturbing is enough of a reason to have me killed, and since he isn’t tied closely to my family like Lutz is, if he tells them that I’m creepy, it won’t actually be that damaging.\n\n\n In the worst case, he distances himself from me and Lutz, and the two of us can no longer become apprentices at his shop. However, in that case, we could take the guild leader and Freida’s offers instead. It’s not like we’d have nowhere to go if Benno casts us out.\n\n\n If having enough money means I can live, then I want to live.\n\n\n “…Understood,” I say, looking up at him. “Three small gold coins it is.”\n\n\n He nods slightly, releasing my hands. Then, after we touch our guild cards together, he arbitrarily grabs my tote bag and yanks out my ordering set.\n\n\n “Hey, that’s my bag!”\n\n\n “And these are my things.”\n\n\n “I mean, you’re right, but please at least excuse yourself first!”\n\n\n “Ah, excuse me,” he says, in a tone of voice that makes me think he’s not actually the slightest bit sorry.\n\n\n Taking pen and ink in hand, he gets an order form ready to use as a notepad.\n\n\n “Well then, how about you start telling me? Let’s start with how you think we can sell the failing oil from before.”\n\n\n “You need to add some sort of 'scrub’ in order to loosen the dirt. There are a lot of different things you could use as a 'scrub’, but I think the best thing to use would be salt. If you grind salt into a fine enough powder, it will not only clean off any dirt but should also serve as a deodorant.”\n\n\n “Salt, you say?”\n\n\n In my memories of what I’d read, the simplest solution would be to take a vegetable oil, then mix it with finely-powdered salt. Benno’s eyes widen, perhaps because he wasn’t very familiar with salt and was a little surprised.\n\n\n “…Then, if you add dried 'citrus’, I mean, ummm, feriginne peel, ground up very fine, then it’ll clean and smell much better than if you didn’t add anything else.”\n\n\n “Feriginne peel, okay. Anything else?”\n\n\n He glances up at me, pen still clacking on the board as he writes.\n\n\n “Anything else? Mixing in tiny pieces of 'nuts’ …argh, nüst would be good, I think. I haven’t been able to do any of these, though, my family really doesn’t want me to waste anything,” I say, with a small laugh.\n\n\n Benno stares at me pointedly, like he’s just heard a particularly interesting piece of information.\n\n\n “You haven’t done any of these, but you still know them? …Maine, who are you?”\n\n\n “That’s a secret. Small gold coins won’t buy that.”\n\n\n Benno twists his mouth, looking like he swallowed a bug. Sitting in front of him is a person he doesn’t himself understand. Under his suspicious gaze, my heart suddenly starts pounding again. The longer this goes on, the less composed I become. I’m not strong at all.\n\n\n I paste a smile onto my face, then make a gamble that could overturn everything I’ve worked for.\n\n\n “You’d fire a creepy kid like me, wouldn’t you?”\n\n\n “Wh–?!”\n\n\n “I was ready for something like this, giving you that information, you know?”\n\n\n Benno looks down at the table, noisily scratching at his head, then lets out an enormous sigh. He shakes his head back and forth slowly, then looks up at me.\n\n\n “No, if I thought I could make money off of her, I wouldn’t want her getting snatched up by someone else, so I’d keep her locked up as tightly as I could. I’m a merchant, after all.”\n\n\n Having noisily stood up, he reaches out and gently ruffles my hair, like he always does. With that familiar action, he tells me that we’re maintaining the status quo. After I breathe a long sigh of relief, I shove his hand, which was still ruffling my hair, away, and stick my tongue out at him."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n This is the season where it’s absurdly difficult to get out of bed in the morning. While I hide under the sheets, grumbling about how cold it is, my father, who’s already almost done getting ready for work, calls out to me.\n\n\n “Maine, are you feeling alright today?”\n\n\n “Hmm? No worse than usual? What’s up, Daddy?”\n\n\n I wonder if he saw me squirming around under the covers and guessed that I’d come down with something? I abruptly hop out of bed, earning a worried frown from my father.\n\n\n “Otto wants to meet with you to discuss this winter’s work, so he asked me if you’d come to the gate when the weather was clear and you’re feeling all right.”\n\n\n “Oh! I don’t have a fever today, and I don’t have anything arranged with Mister Benno either, so I’ll go to the gate today.”\n\n\n The gates open at the second bell, so when it draws near, I wave goodbye to my father as he heads off to work. Then, quickly, I change my clothes, right there on top of the bed.\n\n\n “Mommy, Tory. I’m gonna go to the gate today.”\n\n\n “Oh yeah,” says Tory. “There’s not that much stuff left in the forest to gather anymore. Mom, it’s better for Maine to stop going to the forest now, right?”\n\n\n “You’re absolutely right,” replies my mother. “If she gets a fever and faints again she’d be in big trouble, so it’s for the best that she doesn’t go to the forest with just the other kids anymore.”\n\n\n Lately, the weather has gotten very chilly, and the season where it’s easiest to catch a cold has come around. Lately, there are more and more days where even I can recognize that my physical condition isn’t particularly good. If I keep pushing hard, I’ll only be a burden to everyone around me, so I should take care of myself and stay out of the forest.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine!” calls Lutz as I head down the stairs carrying only my tote bag. “You going to the gate today?”\n\n\n In order to make sure I don’t catch a cold, I’ve been dressed in a ton of layers of clothing. Unlike me, the other children look comparatively nimble, since being bundled up like I am makes it rather difficult to move. There isn’t very much time left before the snow starts to fall, so today’s the last spurt of activity towards gathering firewood.\n\n\n I walk along with the other children as they head towards the gates. Lately, I’ve been able to walk fast enough that I don’t get separated from the rest of the children anymore. Every time I try to push a little harder, though, Lutz shoots me down with a stern warning.\n\n\n “Right, so we’ll stop by here on our way back, so wait here, okay?”\n\n\n “Okay! Good luck with your gathering, Lutz!”\n\n\n I wave farewell from the gates as the others continue on towards the forest. I don’t see my father anywhere, but I find one of the younger gatekeepers I’ve made acquaintances with and have him let me into the night duty room.\n\n\n “Mister Otto, are you here? It’s Maine!”\n\n\n As I open the door and step inside, I see that the shelves along the walls are packed full of thin wooden boards for the budget estimations.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine! Thanks for coming out.”\n\n\n “Hello, Mister Otto, it’s been a while.”\n\n\n After we exchange crisp salutes, he ushers me to the chair closest to the fire. It’s a little on the tall side, so I have to halfway climb up onto it, but once I’m settled, I pull my slate and slate pencils out of my bag.\n\n\n “How often do you think you’ll be able to make it out here this winter?” he asks.\n\n\n “Ummm, I talked it over with my father, but we decided that I could come on days when I’m feeling well, the snow isn’t too bad to walk in, and my father is working either the morning or day shift.”\n\n\n First of all, there aren’t very many days during the winter where I’m feeling very well. Since I’m at least a little bit stronger this year than last, I really hope that the number of times I catch a cold and wind up stuck in bed are both rare and brief, but I have no way to really predict how often it will actually be.\n\n\n Next is the weather. There aren’t very many days during the winter where there isn’t a snowstorm, either. On sparklingly clear days, there’s nothing to worry about. My father says there’s nothing to worry about on days when the snowfall is light, but once it actually starts drifting from the sky I think he’ll stop me.\n\n\n And, finally, my father will be on the night shift for basically a third of the winter in total.\n\n\n “Most likely,” I continue, “I’ll barely need two hands to count the number of days I’ll be able to come out here, I think.”\n\n\n “…Well, I’d guessed as much, but really, you only helped me out for one day last year and it was still a huge help, so I’ve really got my hopes up for this year, too. I’ll be very glad for your help no matter how often you can come.”\n\n\n “Thanks!”\n\n\n It’s a good thing that I’ll be able to earn a bunch of slate pencils by just doing calculation work. Since this year I’ll be helping with Lutz’s education, we’ll need a lot more slate pencils than I did last year, so I plan on working as hard as I can.\n\n\n “Ah! When I’m working on the estimations, you’ll be providing the slate pencils I’m using, not me, right?”\n\n\n “Heh… hahaha! Well, aren’t you thinking like a merchant now? Of course the slate pencils are part of the cost. Don’t worry about it, just calculate.”\n\n\n After I suddenly remembered the question I needed to ask, Otto’s eyes went round for a moment before he burst into laughter. I may be getting laughed at, but at least now I can do my work without any doubts. I roll up my sleeves a little so that I won’t accidentally rub out any numbers, then pick up my slate pencil.\n\n\n “All set,” I say.\n\n\n “Right, here’s today’s work.”\n\n\n Otto brings over an enormous pile of wooden boards and drops them on the table with a clatter. These are the tallies of the furnishings and equipment used by the higher-ups at their duty station. It seems like Otto is in charge of doing the accounting for this entire post. Hanging his head, he tells me that he’d brought this on himself by pointing out a mistake in one of his superiors’ calculations.\n\n\n I start working on totaling up the sums, triple-checking my work to make sure that I don’t make any mistakes, either.\n\n\n “Otto, you here?! Come out, it’s an emergency!”\n\n\n A soldier bursts into the room, looking frantic. Otto quickly jots a line down on his sheet to mark his place, then dashes out of the room, telling me over his shoulder not to let anyone touch his calculator.\n\n\n It seems that, for some reason, the entire guard contingent at the gate has been called to action. From the corridor on the other side of the door, I can hear the rush of countless footsteps, amplified to a roar by echoes off the stone pavement. In this enormous commotion, there’s nobody outside that I could ask what’s happening right now.\n\n\n I’ve been to the gate countless times to help out, but this is the first time I’ve seen it be this ridiculously noisy. Left all by myself in this room, I feel thick, cold anxiety slowly oozing into my heart.\n\n\n Is it… okay, for me to be here?\n\n\n I take a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves. As I look around the empty room I’ve been left alone in, I suddenly feel the lurch of vertigo. My fever, refusing to overlook even the tiniest lapse in my concentration, suddenly thrashes about within me, as if it’s pointing out the weakness in my heart. Recalling my life’s irritations, I send my will through my body, forcing the fever back into the depths of my heart, imagining screwing a lid shut on it so tightly that it cannot escape.\n\n\n “…Whoof, I’m tired.”\n\n\n After struggling so hard against the devouring, my anxiety about what’s happening outside has dramatically decreased. I sit back down to resume my calculations, but Otto immediately comes back into the room. He quickly finishes up the calculations he’d finished thus far, and starts tidying up his share of the paperwork.\n\n\n “It looks like a bunch of tronbay has appeared in the forest. The kids came running for help, so more than half of the gate guard headed out to deal with it. I’ve got to go stand by the gate, but, Maine, can you stay here and keep working? Also, if any letters of introduction show up, I’ll direct them here, so please take care of them for me.”\n\n\n “Right, understood.”\n\n\n With the cause of the disturbance identified, I feel a little bit better, and I get back to tackling the remaining work. Now that I think about it, Lutz had mentioned that tronbay started coming around in the fall. I wonder, maybe we can get some tronbay for ourselves.\n\n\n Hm? Although, it looks like the soldiers will be participating as well, so maybe it’s grown too much by now, to the point that we won’t be able to use it for paper? I wonder…\n\n\n Last time, it was possible for the children to cut it down by themselves, so I turn back to my calculations, thinking that it’s not something anybody should be quite so worried about. After a while, though, I once again hear the clamor of people talking though the closed door.\n\n\n “Maine,” says Otto, “Lutz has come back. He says he has something he wants to discuss with you and would like for you to return home with him. What do you think?”\n\n\n “If he cut down any tronbay, I think that’s what he’ll want to talk with me about, so I’ll go home. I’ve finished the calculations from here to here.”\n\n\n “Thanks, Maine, you’re a great help.”\n\n\n By the gate, I can see soldiers and children alike milling about, seeming to have just returned from the forest and carrying bundles of raw tronbay. As I scan the crowd, looking for Lutz, my father rushes up to me, a chunk of wood as big as I am hoisted up on his shoulder.\n\n\n “Maine! Look at the size of this tronbay that your daddy cut down!”\n\n\n “Whooa, that’s big! Is that gonna be firewood?”\n\n\n “No, tronbay doesn’t burn very easily, so we won’t do that. I’m going to make furniture out of it instead. When there’s big house fires, things made of tronbay sometimes don’t burn up, so it’s used for making things you put your valuables in.”\n\n\n “…Huh, I didn’t know that. That’s really cool!”\n\n\n As expected of such a mysterious plant. To not burn up, even in a huge fire… that’s not even wood, anymore!\n\n\n As I let out an astonished breath at this new surprise, I notice Lutz standing behind my father, beckoning me closer.\n\n\n “What’s up, Lutz?” I ask.\n\n\n “Heh, Lutz,” says my father, looking down at the basket on Lutz’s back, “were those skinny sticks all you could manage to cut down?”\n\n\n He puffs out his chest pridefully, like he’s just won a competition. I’d really like him to stop competing against children. It’s embarrassing. I let out a long, exasperated sigh, but I can see a lot of the other soldiers and children nearby comparing the size of the trees and branches they cut down, since it’s so difficult to cut down once it matures.\n\n\n “There’s not really any use for thin branches like that,” says one.\n\n\n Since tronbay hard to burn, you can’t use sticks like that as firewood, and such young, soft wood couldn’t hold back the heat of a blaze, so it can’t be used as furniture, either.\n\n\n “These sticks are uuuuseless!” says another child. Out of the corner of my eye, I see him angrily chuck the pile of slender branches he was caring to the ground with a clatter.\n\n\n “Ah, those are perfect for me,” I say.\n\n\n Even if that child doesn’t need them, they’re perfect materials for making high-grade paper. It would be an enormous waste to throw away such slender, soft wood.\n\n\n “You really don’t need them?” I ask.\n\n\n “…N… no!”\n\n\n Suddenly noticing how many people were staring at him, the boy runs off, shouting at me over his shoulder. As I gather up the pile of sticks he discarded, other children come up to me, offering me similarly slender tronbay cuttings out of their own baskets.\n\n\n “Hey, take these too. All I’d get if I brought these home is my dad mad at me.”\n\n\n “I’ll give these to you. I don’t need them.”\n\n\n Shortly, a huge quantity of sticks has been piled up around me.\n\n\n “Lutz, I’ve… got a lot of wood here.”\n\n\n “…Yep.”\n\n\n Lutz and I set to neatly organizing the pile of branches into neat stacks, then cramming Lutz’s basket as full as it can get. My father, dumbfounded by this turn of events, looks back and forth between me, Lutz, and the overstuffed basket, a troubled scowl on his face.\n\n\n “…Hey, Maine. What are you going to do with all that?”\n\n\n “We use young, soft wood to use, so this is good. Lutz, let’s go?”\n\n\n I turn my back on my father and walk away. Lutz follows, scratching his head, looking a little troubled himself.\n\n\n “When I was cutting the tronbay down, I was thinking we could use it as raw materials too, but… we have to actually use it within like five to seven days, right, otherwise it doesn’t work?”\n\n\n “Yeah, that’s right, what’s wrong?”\n\n\n “…What do we do now? I really don’t want to go stand in the river during this season, and we don’t have enough extra firewood to steam this stuff for over a bell… do we give up?”\n\n\n I’m well aware that in this season, even if you were to go to the forest, you wouldn’t find very much in the way of firewood, but I’m also certain that if we let all this tronbay go to waste for such a reason, Benno would be so indignant that his eyes might pop out of his skull.\n\n\n “…I understand what you’re saying, but maybe we should go talk to Mister Benno first?”\n\n\n “Yeah, I guess he’d get real mad if we just threw it away on our own.” He lets out a long sigh. “Man… I reeeally don’t want to go stand in the river when it’s this cold out.”\n\n\n We plod our way towards Benno’s shop, but, as one might expect, the watchman outside tells Lutz that he can’t let him in looking like he just came back from gathering sticks in the forest, so he’ll have to stay outside. At the watchman’s call, Mark comes out from within the store and escorts me inside. A customer is just leaving Benno’s office when I enter the store. As we pass each other, he looks down at me, notes my mismatched appearance, and snorts disdainfully.\n\n\n I really should order those clothes sooner rather than later. I don’t want to lessen the dignity of Benno’s shop just by being here. I need to keep saving as much money as I can.\n\n\n Benno looks mildly surprised when I’m shown into his office.\n\n\n “What is it? We didn’t have a meeting scheduled today, right?”\n\n\n “We didn’t have anything schedule, no, but I needed to talk to you… to be frank, tronbay showed up in the forest today.”\n\n\n As soon as the words leave my mouth, Benno stands up so suddenly that his chair clunks behind him. He leans forward excitedly across his desk.\n\n\n “Did you say tronbay?! Did you cut it down?!”\n\n\n “Yes, sir, we were able to get quite a lot of it. It’s just, well…”\n\n\n “What is it?”\n\n\n “Making it into paper is… hard.”\n\n\n “Why?”\n\n\n He frowns dubiously at me, not seeming to understand. I open my mouth to reply, guessing that he’s absolutely about to get angry.\n\n\n “Ummm, well, we, we need to steam the wood for a bell’s worth of time, which we don’t have enough firewood for, and then we…”\n\n\n “You imbecile!”\n\n\n I was about to say that we couldn’t soak it in the river like we need to, but before I could finish listing all of our reasons, Benno impatiently cut me off, yelling in a voice like the crash of thunder.\n\n\n “You can buy firewood literally any time of the year! You can’t possibly have thought of comparing it to tronbay, which is exceedingly rare! And don’t even try to tell me that you can’t do that cost/benefit math!”\n\n\n “…That’s what I thought you were going to say. Since I’d like to buy firewood, may I ask Mister Mark to take me to the lumberyard?”\n\n\n Since there is no way that anyone could possibly mistake me for a child who has already had her baptism, if I were to walk up to a store and ask for some firewood they’d probably just look at me suspiciously and shoo me away.\n\n\n “…Where’s Lutz?”\n\n\n “Waiting outside, sir. We came here immediately after he returned from the forest, so he’s not really presentable enough to enter the shop…”\n\n\n As I speak, Benno rings the small bell on his desk, summoning Mark.\n\n\n “Mark, please go ask Lutz if Maine is okay to walk to the lumberyard today.”\n\n\n “Certainly, sir.”\n\n\n “Maine, write up your order form here,” he says, tapping on the desk.\n\n\n I shake my head. “Ummm, since all I had planned to do today was go to the gate, I don’t have any of my ordering forms with me.”\n\n\n “…I have some here.”\n\n\n Benno produces a thin wooden board and some ink, and I start writing out my order there on the spot.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, I just want enough firewood to burn for one bell’s worth of time; what should I write?”\n\n\n “Just write it like that. I’ll probably be able to sell off any surplus.” “Yes, sir,” I reply.\n\n\n As I write, Mark returns with Lutz’s answers.\n\n\n “It seems that it would be better for Maine to not do any more walking than she has already. When you’ve finished writing up the order, he and I will head for the lumberyard ourselves.”\n\n\n “Thank you very much,” I reply.\n\n\n After I hand him the finished order form and see him off, Benno hands me a stack of several wooden sheets.\n\n\n “Read these when you have some time.”\n\n\n “Gladly!”\n\n\n On these wooden sheets is more knowledge that could be called common knowledge for merchants: information about how contracts work. I hum happily to myself, overjoyed to be reading, but as I continue to skim, questions start steadily popping up inside my head.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, will this firewood purchase be treated as part of the initial investment?”\n\n\n “……”\n\n\n Benno soundlessly turns to fix his gaze directly on me, giving no answer.\n\n\n “Also, I’ve been thinking that this was kind of strange, but the other day when we delivered the prototype you said that that was the end of what you’d call initial investment, right? But, unless I’m mistaken, didn’t the magical contract state that it would last until our baptismal ceremonies? Are you not planning on covering the cost of the larger paper frame as part of the initial investment?”\n\n\n If I had to think about why Benno would specifically have me read about contracts, the only thing that comes to mind is the subject of our contract magic.\n\n\n “…Tch, you noticed?”\n\n\n “Why would you try to cheat me?!”\n\n\n “I wasn’t really trying to cheat you. That was a test, to see whether or not you two could remember the contents of a contract you’ve signed. I wanted to see how you’d respond if you caught your partner in violation of the contract. Since you hadn’t said anything, I was wondering if you’d forgotten.”\n\n\n He snorts dismissively, drumming his fingers on the top of his desk as he stares fixedly at me. After a brief moment of speechlessness, I lock eyes with him seriously.\n\n\n “When you said that the initial investments were finished after we’d completed our prototypes, I though to myself, ‘oh, I guess that’s what it was’. I never thought that you would try to cheat us, Mister Benno, and since the contract magic burned up the original written copy I had no way to check the terms for myself.”\n\n\n He snorts again, his lips creeping up into a sneer.\n\n\n “If the original contract got burned,” he replies, shrugging, “then you should have either written down a copy elsewhere or completely memorized it. You’re too naive.”\n\n\n “…I’ll keep that in mind, sir.”\n\n\n He’s not at all wrong. If you don’t get a copy of a contract, then it’s your job to either copy it down somewhere yourself or commit it to memory. I was just foolishly leaning on the fact that I was told the penalties for breaking a magical contract were severe.\n\n\n “Now that you’ve pointed that out, then, yeah, I’ll pay for the rest of the initial purchase.”\n\n\n “You say you’ll pay for it now, but don’t we have a contract that says you needed to pay for it anyway? Wouldn’t that have been a breach of contract?”\n\n\n I frown at him, lips pursed tightly together. Benno, however, smiles triumphantly, looking at me with a face full of joy.\n\n\n “If I’d said that I wouldn’t, that would have been a violation. This one was your fault for not doing more research. If you asked me for something, I’d pay for it and, since I paid, there wouldn’t be a violation. If you’re going to be a merchant, you have to remember these things.”\n\n\n “…Urgh…” His smirk grows only smugger when he sees how vexed I am. “If you’d read through all that information on contracts and still hadn’t noticed, I was planning on taking advantage of it even harder,” he laughs.\n\n\n Since Benno so kindly gave me a hint so that I’d realize what was happening, I’m going to be optimistic about this and look at it as him trying to give me valuable training towards being a merchant… but vexing things are still so vexing.\n\n\n Determined not to be fooled again, I go over the sheets again, paying much closer attention this time. When I’m in the middle, though, Benno suddenly stops working and calls out to me.\n\n\n “Ah, that’s right. Maine, can you accelerate the schedule on your winter handiwork?”\n\n\n “My family’s already done with preparing for the winter, more-or-less, so I think that it might be possible, if we needed to?”\n\n\n The amount of time it takes for my family to complete our winter preparations is largely determined by my father’s work schedule. Although every soldier at the gate needs to prepare for the winter, there’s no way that they can all simultaneously take leave of their posts to go do so, so they take turns taking days off in order to spread the workload. Last year, my father’s days off were very late in the season, so we were only just barely able to get things finished in time for the first snowfall, but this year we’ve finished with comparatively plenty of time to spare.\n\n\n “Do you think you could make about, say, ten or twenty hairpins of different colors? The guild master’s granddaughter has been bragging about hers, so I’ve had a lot of enquiries about them. …Including several that I can not turn down.”\n\n\n “I thought Frieda wanted to stand out by having the only one at the winter baptismal ceremony? Wouldn’t doing this make hers less special?”\n\n\n I tilt my head doubtfully to the side. Is it really okay to do this when the entire reason we overcharged her so much was because it was going to be special, I wonder?\n\n\n Benno’s eyes falter, just the tiniest bit. “…Hers are going to be the only ones that match her perfectly. The rest of them are going to be off the shelf, so that’ll make hers just stand out even more. There’s no problem.”\n\n\n “If there’s no problem, then that’s fine with me, but if you need these to be finished in a hurry, are you willing to pay for expedited service?”\n\n\n He seems momentarily dumbfounded that I just demanded extra money from him. I smile sweetly back.\n\n\n “Whenever and wherever you can take money, take it, it’s something to be taken,” I recite. “Right? I’m studying under you, Mister Benno, trying to be a merchant like you are.”\n\n\n I chuckle to myself as Benno makes an unreasonably disgusted expression, his entire face pulling taut.\n\n\n “Ten medium copper coins per hairpin. That’s double what it was before, so there’s no problems there, right?”\n\n\n “That simply won’t do. I must ask for either eleven or thirteen medium copper coins, if you would. I must consider the share of the profit that Lutz and I have previously agreed on with respect to the differences between the flower and the pin portions. If I don’t, it would be very inconvenient for me.”\n\n\n We had previously told our families that the flower portions were worth two coins and the pins were worth one. Since Lutz and I are to split the remaining coin evenly, having an odd number of coins left to split would be, honestly, a bother.\n\n\n “Can’t be helped. Eleven it is. You’re getting good at this,” he says, ruefully.\n\n\n “I am quite humbly delighted to be praised for such a small thing, sir.”\n\n\n “…Really, where did you learn to talk like that?” he murmurs, halfway between amazed and amused, and shrugs his shoulders.\n\n\n “Ah, also,” I say, “I’d like one coin per hairpin I have to make right now. I’d prefer if this was prepayment, but if you need to take it out of my savings, that would be fine, too…”\n\n\n “Alright, I don’t mind paying you in advance, but what’s this for?”\n\n\n “To weave a spell of urgency,” I reply.\n\n\n If I need to make ten of these before the snow starts to fall, then I need to enlist the cooperation of Tory and my mother and, in order to do that, I need to give them some motivation. My mother, in particular, has been doing winter handiwork for many years now, and knows just how large the payment I’m promising for each of these is, compared to other things she’s done. So, she has some doubts, somewhere: either we’re being deceived somehow, or even if we do make these we won’t get paid. If I can actually give them money for each of these they make, money that they can use right now for additional provisions, then not only can I earn their trust, but I can also boost their motivation as well.\n\n\n A knock comes at the door, and Mark reenters the room.\n\n\n “I’ve returned,” he says. “The firewood you ordered will arrive here by the time the gates close. Someone from the shop will deliver it to you tomorrow morning.”\n\n\n “Thank you very much,” I reply.\n\n\n “Now then, it’s very cold outside, so please take care.”\n\n\n After Mark ushers me out of the shop, I see Lutz standing to the side, the basket on his back conspicuously empty. It seems that on the way to the lumberyard they stopped by the warehouse so that he could deposit the tronbay there. Ah, of course, no wonder that he wouldn’t have wanted to bring me along.\n\n\n We walk slowly home, through streets that rapidly darken as the sun grows dim behind the horizon. It really is cold, so I want to hurry home as quickly as possible, but if I run as fast as my instincts tell me, it’s absolutely certain that I’ll get sick again.\n\n\n As we plod onwards, I discuss with Lutz the plan for accelerating the schedule on our winter handiwork, telling him about how I secured an expedited delivery fee and my plans for getting my family to help so we can make it on time. Lutz nods once, then scrunches his eyebrows in concern.\n\n\n “So, I’m not worried so much about what’s going to happen if I can’t get my family to help and I have to do everything by myself. It’s the tronbay I’m worried about.”\n\n\n “The tronbay?”\n\n\n I tilt my head to the side concernedly. Lutz lets out a huge sigh, his shoulders drooping.\n\n\n “…Hey, Maine. You’ve been told you can’t go to the forest anymore, so is there actually any way we can still prepare the tronbay? Am I really going to have to do it all by myself?”\n\n\n “This time I think we can do it all in front of the warehouse, so I can help you there. Although, we’d have to be outside for at least a bell, so I don’t know what my family would say about that…”\n\n\n There’s no way I can actually leave the town’s gates, but if we’re talking about doing something like going to Benno’s shop, the trip itself isn’t particularly difficult. The exposure to the cold, however, is the difficult part. If I’m outside for a long period of time, the chances of me getting sick are strikingly high.\n\n\n “The warehouse… you mean we don’t have to go to the river?!”\n\n\n His eyes have gone very round with shock. However, even if you think about it, asking him to carry the pot, the steamer, and the firewood to the forest all by himself would be completely unreasonable.\n\n\n “Before, we were getting both our raw materials and the firewood out in the forest, so it was more efficient for us to do our work out there too, but this time, we already have the tronbay and the firewood here in the workshop, right? We don’t specifically need to go out to the forest for this, so we’d be overdoing it if we dragged everything all the way out there.”\n\n\n “Ah, really? I was going to have to lug all of that stuff…”\n\n\n It seems like he was so worried about the fact that he was going to have to work alone that he hadn’t even thought about the sheer quantity of stuff he was going to have to carry out to the forest.\n\n\n “We won’t have river water to immediately dunk the wood into after it’s steamed, but the reason we do that is so that we can expose it to cold water in order to make it easier to peel the bark off. The water in the well should be more than cold enough this time of year. We’ll need to draw water from the well several times in order to make sure that the water we’re soaking the wood in doesn’t get lukewarm, but that’s way easier than going to the forest, right?”\n\n\n However, Lutz’s face grows even more gloomy. There’s no way I could have allayed all his concerns in at once.\n\n\n “That’s… easier, but… what about after that? How are we going to preserve the bark?”\n\n\n “If we could get all the way to preserving the white bark, that would be great, but it’s not like it’s impossible to preserve the black bark either. It might make stripping it off a little more difficult later, but in this weather me going to the forest is dangerous, and you even thinking about going into the river is suicidal, so let’s stop there.”\n\n\n “Alright!”\n\n\n With the final cause of his worries dispelled, Lutz looks ahead, face shining. He broadens his gait just a little bit as we walk, constantly repeating things like “oh man, I’m so happy, this is a huge relief”.\n\n\n When we get home, I’m going to need to ask Tory and my mother for help with the handiwork… and then we’re steaming the wood tomorrow, huh…?\n\n\n As I continue to plan out what I need to do after this, my thoughts begin to drift gradually off course, perhaps because I’m really hungry.\n\n\n …And now that we have a steamer, I really want to eat some piping hot steamed sweet potato, ooh, or some fluffy buttery mashed potatoes. We don’t have any sweet potato equivalent, but I’m pretty sure I can get a tuber around here that’s enough like a potato. I’ll get the potatoes, and Lutz can get the butter, so tomorrow we can have mashed potatoes, right? Aaah, that’ll be so good! Mashed potatoes are great for warming up both your body and your soul. Yep, that’s settled.\n\n\n At some point, while I’m lost in my imagination, we arrive at the water well in front of our houses. Lutz stops walking and turns to look at me.\n\n\n “Maine, I’ll go get the warehouse key from the shop, and then when the firewood arrives I’ll come and get you. Wait at home until then, okay?”\n\n\n “Got it. Remember to get the butter, too!”\n\n\n I give him a huge wave, then disappear into my building. As I climb the stairs, I can hear Lutz’s stunned voice echo in through the windows.\n\n\n “Eh? What?! Butter?! What butter?! What do we need butter for?!”\n\n\n Huh? Did I not tell him? Oops."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n As soon as we finish with dinner, my father heads immediately for bed, since he has to work the dawn shift tomorrow. In order to make sure we don’t disturb him while he’s trying to sleep, the rest of us relocate to the kitchen, where we can quietly busy ourselves with whatever work we can do, quietly, to kill time before we need to go to bed as well.\n\n\n Now that my father’s gone into the bedroom and started getting himself ready for bed, I jump right onto the topic of winter handiwork.\n\n\n “So, today, Mister Benno told me that the hairpins we made for Freida were getting really famous, and there’s a lot of people wanting to buy them, so he wanted to know if we could maybe get some of our winter handiwork done early. He says he wants more like Tory’s hairpin.”\n\n\n “…Well, it’s not like we can’t, but…”\n\n\n Tory and my mother exchange a glance, then frown doubtfully at me. The rest of that sentence is clearly written on their faces: it’s not like they can’t, but it would be way too much work to accelerate production enough. Their reaction is exactly what I expected, so I go fetch my tote bag and pull out the proof: two medium-copper coins, which jingle as I set them down on the table.\n\n\n “It’s just a little bit, but I was able to get him to let me hold onto some money in advance, so if you can get one done, I can pay you for it!”\n\n\n In the next instant, the two of them abruptly stand up, their chairs clattering behind them, and move to the part of the table closest to the stove, where it’s just a little bit brighter.\n\n\n “Uh? What?”\n\n\n I’ve suddenly been left behind, sitting dumfounded in my chair like an empty-headed fool. Meanwhile, Tory has dug out enough slender needles for the three of us, and my mother has disappeared into the storeroom to fetch the basket full of thread. I’m a little overwhelmed by how perfectly in sync the two of them are, but I hop down from my chair and pull it over to the table. As it clatters along the floor behind me, my mother calls out to me.\n\n\n “Maine, do you have a sample we can base this off of?”\n\n\n “Um? It’s just like Tory’s, I think?”\n\n\n Reacting instantly to my words, Tory immediately spins around and heads to get her hairpin out of her wooden storage box. Thanks to her rustling about in the bedroom as she searches for her hairpin, I can hear my father groggily speak up.\n\n\n “What’s happening? Is something wrong?”\n\n\n “Nothing’s wrong, Gunther,” replies my mother, calling to him from the kitchen. “Good night!”\n\n\n By the time I’ve gotten my chair over the table and climbed up onto it, the preparations for our handiwork have been completed.\n\n\n “Maine,” asks my mother, “what colors should we use?”\n\n\n She rummages around within the basket of threads, but I haven’t actually told her what colors to use yet. All I’ve said so far is that the design needs to be like Tory’s hairpin.\n\n\n “We don’t know what the customers’ hair color or favorite colors are, so Mister Benno told me that he wants ones with lots of different colors. Let’s do these like Tory’s and pick three colors, and make the same number of flowers.”\n\n\n “Got it. How about white, yellow, and red?”\n\n\n “I think that’ll be cute!”\n\n\n The instant the words leave my mouth, my mother starts knitting ferociously. Since she helped make Tory’s hairpin last winter, she already knows how to do it, and now she’s working so very, very quickly. In the approximately fifteen minutes it takes me to knit one flower, she’s churned out five. Soon, we’ve knitted four of each and turned it into a little bouquet.\n\n\n “He’ll be happy if there’s a bunch of different ones to choose from, right? Maybe I should do white, yellow, and blue…? The same colors as mine. Maine, what are you gonna pick?”\n\n\n Tory giggles happily to herself as she digs through the many different colors, picking out three that she likes. She seems very pleased with the hairpin that I’d made for her last year, which makes me happy as well.\n\n\n “I think I’ll do pink, red, and green. The green flowers are going to look like little leaves, which I think will be really cute.”\n\n\n “Yeah! Really cute. …Hey, hey, Maine, how do you make these?”\n\n\n Tory, probably thinking that she’d better not disturb our mother as she single-mindedly weaves away, scoots her chair next to me, it clattering against the wooden floor. Since the hairpin that we’re using as an example had been made for Tory’s sake, she hadn’t had any part in making it.\n\n\n “Oh, it’s not really that hard. So, you loop it like this, and then you thread it through like this…”\n\n\n I explain to Tory how to weave these tiny flowers, demonstrating as I went. Since these are much simpler than the roses we made for Freida, Tory picked up on it immediately.\n\n\n “Got it! Thanks, Maine.”\n\n\n She clatteringly drags her chair back to its original position, then starts quietly, steadily knitting. After a while, once I’ve finished my third flower, I glance up at the rest of the table, and am overwhelmed by the sheer difference in quantity. My mother has already finished enough little flower to make an entire hairpin, and Tory has six flowers rolling around in front of her.\n\n\n Whoa, now these are some sewing beauties.\n\n\n Both my mother and Tory move their hands so quickly that my own movements can’t even compare. They can do these in practically the blink of an eye. I may be the one who brought this arts-and-crafts stuff here, but now I’m being outstripped in both speed of production and quality of product. I decide that, at the very least, whatever I make is not going to be obviously inferior to what they make when compared, and I start moving my needles again.\n\n\n Ordinarily, winter handiwork is done while we’re trapped inside by the snow and left with far, far too much time on our hands. It’s something that we do because there’s nothing else to do, and we idly chat with each other while doing it. Tonight, however, thanks the gleam of the coins lined up on the table, the two of them are focusing their entire effort on knitting as quickly as they can, with not a single word coming out of their mouths.\n\n\n “Alright, done! Now what, Maine?”\n\n\n I look up, startled by Tory’s sparklingly enthusiastic voice, and see that she has twelve flowers lined up in front of her.\n\n\n “Whoa, Tory, that was fast! You’re really amazing. Ummm, after this, we sew them onto a bit of cloth… wait, argh, cloth! I didn’t account for cloth!”\n\n\n “Usually,” my mother says, “we provide our own materials for winter handiwork, so it’s okay if you use whatever scraps we have lying around here.”\n\n\n My mother has already retrieved a scrap of cloth and sewn her little flowers onto it, turning it into something that looks like a proper hairpin.\n\n\n “…When I go see Mister Benno to collect the money for these, I’ll put in a request for some cloth, too.”\n\n\n “He’s already paying us two whole medium copper coins for each of these, so there’s no need to go that far.”\n\n\n …What? Man, how unfair is ordinary winter handiwork?\n\n\n Even as I was deciding for myself that I’d have added cloth to my calculations by the time winter rolls around and we get started in earnest, Tory has already brought a basket full of scrap cloth out of the storage room.\n\n\n “Look at the one Mommy’s finished as an example. Sew the flowers on, but don’t put too many of the same color close together. If you sew everything together so that you can’t see the cloth beneath, then it’ll really look like a little bouquet of flowers.”\n\n\n “Got it, thanks!” replies Tory.\n\n\n By the time Tory finishes putting together her second hairpin, it’s almost about time to pack everything away for the evening. Ultimately, I was able to complete about half of the flowers for one hairpin, Tory made an entire pin herself, and my mother’s eighty percent along the way towards making her second.\n\n\n “Now then, here is today’s pa~ay!”\n\n\n “Woohoo!”\n\n\n I hand the two of them two coins each, and put the two finished hairpins in my box for later.\n\n\n “Alright now,” says my mother, “you two go to bed.”\n\n\n “What about you, Mom?” asks Tory.\n\n\n “I’ll just finish up this half-complete one here, first.”\n\n\n She points at the eighty-percent completed hairpin in front of her with a grim smile. At her speed, she’ll be done in no time flat. Tory and I quietly head for bed, taking care not to wake our father in the process.\n\n\n I wonder, though; why is it that by the time we wake up there are two finished hairpins sitting on top of the table? …You pulled an all-nighter, mother. Tory didn’t want to go to bed last night, so now she’s gonna be mad.\n\n\n “Moooom, no fair! Why’d you get to stay up late?”\n\n\n “Sorry, Tory. Now, it’s time for you to go to work! Take care, take care.”\n\n\n Tory sulks furiously as my mother apologetically ushers her out the door. With an extremely disagreeable expression, she runs off, yelling “as soon as I get home I’m going to make lots, okay?” Once she’s gone, my mother hands me the two completed bouquets, and I give her four coins in return.\n\n\n “Here’s the money, so that I don’t forget by the time you get home from work. I’m going to be going to Mister Benno’s shop again today. I’ve gotta go get the pin parts for these from Lutz, get them finished up, and get paid, otherwise I can’t get the rest of the money for you and Tory.”\n\n\n “Alright. Take care of yourself today, Maine! And say hello to Mister Benno for me.”\n\n\n My mother tucks the coins into her coin purse, then starts heading out the door. “Let’s work hard tonight, too!” she says with a broad smile as she waves goodbye. She shuts the door behind her firmly, and I hear the clack of the lock as she turns it. I keep smilingly waving goodbye until I hear her footsteps fade away, then let out an exhausted sigh.\n\n\n Crap. The power of money is way too strong. I hadn’t thought I’d get anywhere close to this kind of speedup. The fact that my mother would stay up so late to keep working was far beyond my expectations. If I don’t get these hairpins finished up and sold so that I can replenish my cash reserves, I’m going to be in serious trouble tonight.\n\n\n “Well, first things first, we gotta peel off all the tronbay bark, though.”\n\n\n I have no idea when Lutz will be by to come pick me up, so I start making sure that I’ve got everything ready to head out on a moment’s notice. First off, I collect a couple of the potato-like kalfe roots. Then, I grab my slate, slate pencils, and calculator so that we can study while the bark is steaming. Since we’re going to Benno’s afterwards, I make sure not to forget to bring my ordering set, too. Finally, In order to complete my own half-finished hairpin, I grab my knitting needles and thread, my seven already-done flowers, a scrap of cloth, and a needle and thread for sewing everything together.\n\n\n I pass the time waiting for Lutz to arrive by working on more flowers, my needles making tiny little movements as I knit. After I manage to finish two, I hear a pounding at the door, followed by Lutz calling out, “Maine, you home?”\n\n\n “Good morning, Lutz! Hey, about those pins, did you finish any?”\n\n\n “I got five done so far…?”\n\n\n “Bring all of them with us. I’m bringing my needles and thread too. We can finish these up while we’re steaming. We have to sell these to Mister Benno tonight.”\n\n\n When I mumble that we wound up finishing four of them last night, Lutz’s eyes go wide.\n\n\n “Wh… That’s way too fast, though?! I thought you said those flowers were super hard to make and took a crazy long time…”\n\n\n “Yeah, I had no idea they’d get done so quickly, either, so I’m honestly in a bit of a hurry now.”\n\n\n “…Got it. You just need me to bring the pins, right? Anything else?”\n\n\n There is one more thing that Lutz absolutely cannot forget to bring today.\n\n\n “What about the butter? Did you get any?”\n\n\n “So I didn’t hear you wrong, huh… I’ll go get some. Wait downstairs for me after you lock up, okay?”\n\n\n It seems that, somehow, he hasn’t prepared any. That was a close call, I nearly missed out on being able to eat steamed, buttered potatoes. I wave as Lutz deftly runs down the stairs, gather up the things I’d prepared, and head outside.\n\n\n “Man, it’s cold…”\n\n\n There’s no sign of anyone else around our warehouse, which is piercingly cold, overpowering the warmth of the clear sunlight shining down. Since there’s no hearth inside the warehouse that we can light a fire in, we get set up right in front of the warehouse so that we can steam the tronbay and strip off the bark.\n\n\n After we put our bags inside, Lutz piles up some rocks to make a stove and sets the pot on top of it while I line up pieces of tronbay inside our steamer. In no time flat, though, the steamer fills up completely.\n\n\n “Lutz, looks like we’re going to need another steamer.”\n\n\n “I’ll go get it.”\n\n\n Previously, all we were doing was working on prototypes, so we never really needed to steam that much wood at once. However, this time, we need to steam all of the raw material that we have on hand. Since we’d had another steamer ready from the start so we could steam two layers at once, Lutz kindly goes to retrieve it for me.\n\n\n “These okay to put on the pot yet?”\n\n\n “Yeah, I’m just about finished getting this wood stacked up in it.”\n\n\n While Lutz gets the steamers situated on top of the pot, I stack up the rest of the tronbay. Then, I take the two kalfe roots I brought with me and make a cross-shaped cut on each of them with my knife so that the heat can get into them better, then I line them up in the steamer with the wood. Once these steam for about twenty minutes, I’ll finally be able to eat delicious, buttery, steamed potatoes (although they’re not actually potatoes).\n\n\n Sitting in front of the pot, close to the fire, I get back to work on making tiny flowers. Since it takes me about fifteen minutes to make each flower, by the time I’m finished up, plus the time it’ll take to get everything squared away, the tubers should be just about finished.\n\n\n “Lutz, could you get some of the leftover bamboo in the warehouse and make me a couple long sticks? Pointy ones, pointier than the ones you made last time.”\n\n\n “Huh? Why?”\n\n\n “Why, you ask? I need them to check to see if the ‘buttered potatoes’ are done.”\n\n\n “Um? Hey, Maine, what are you up to?”\n\n\n “Oh, I just wanna eat some food you need a steamer to make… do you not want any, Lutz?”\n\n\n “If it’s food then I want it! You mean 'buttah’d poh-tay-toes’ are food?!”\n\n\n Ah, that’s right, I must not have explained what buttered potatoes are. Although, there’s already cooking here involving sautéing tubers in butter, so they should be something he could be eating regularly.\n\n\n Now that he knows that there’s food in the steamer too, Lutz cheerfully makes me a pair of bamboo skewers.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine. These 'buttah’d poh-tay-toes’, are they tasty?”\n\n\n “I really like them, myself. I think it’s something you’ve probably already tasted before, though?”\n\n\n Since it takes far longer for the pot to actually come to a boil than I originally expected, I wait until I’ve finished two flowers, instead of just one, then check on the status of the tubers.\n\n\n “Alright, Lutz. Get that lid off!”\n\n\n Standing on top of Ralph’s failed something-or-other, I brandish the skewers tightly in my right hand while gripping my cooking chopsticks in my left, waiting for Lutz to take the lid off the steamer.\n\n\n “Maine don’t stick your face too close!”\n\n\n As soon as Lutz removes the lid, a huge burst of steam leaps out of the steamer. As soon as the scalding vapor clears away and I can see inside, I see the two tubers resting on top of the tronbay, tinted a vibrant golden brown. With my right hand, I carefully insert the skewers into each of the tubers. They come back out easily without the potatoes breaking apart, so I think they’re done pretty well. I swap the chopsticks in my left hand with the skewers in my right, and get them ready.\n\n\n “Lutz, I need a plate!”\n\n\n “You think this place has any?!”\n\n\n “That board over there’s fine, bring that over! Then get the butter ready.”\n\n\n “Maybe you should have done this instead of making decorations!”\n\n\n “Ngh, you’re right…” I say, ashamed.\n\n\n As soon as I lift both of the tubers out of the steamer and set them down on the board, I have Lutz immediately put the lid back on the steamer. I hop down from my makeshift step stool, then immediately widen the cross-shaped cuts on each of them and shove butter inside. The butter melts into the soft flesh of the tubers immediately, and the scent it gives off is irresistible.\n\n\n I’ve been getting more and more excited as these get closer and closer to completion. Lutz, on the other hand, merely looked disappointed as soon as he saw what I took out of the steamer.\n\n\n “…Hey, those are just kalfe roots. I had really high hopes, since it’s your cooking…”\n\n\n It seems that he’s disappointed that this is something he’s eaten before. Kalfe roots are a very common crop in the nearby areas, so they’re an ingredient that shows up on everyone’s dining tables very frequently. I wonder if he’s tired of them? I can see how he’d be disappointed; this is extremely simple cooking. I didn’t even peel them first.\n\n\n “Right, right! These are just kalfe roots cooked with butter, and you’ve eaten lots of these before, right? So you don’t need to eat one, do you?”\n\n\n “…I’ll eat it.”\n\n\n I ignore Lutz as he grumbles to himself, quickly peeling the skin off the very top of the tuber. I wrap my hand in my apron so that it doesn’t get scalded, and pick it up. I bring the steaming potato up to my mouth, open wide, and take an enormous bite.\n\n\n The surface of the tuber had cooled down quickly thanks to the frigid air, but the insides are piping hot as they melt within my mouth. Since they were steamed with the tronbay, they taste faintly of wood, like they were smoked. This flavor has intertwined with the savoriness of the butter, making a flavor that’s nothing like anything I could find at home.\n\n\n “Mmm…,” I say, squirming in pleasure at the taste. Lutz, next to me, simply lets out a sigh, breath white in the cold air, then takes a bite of his own tuber. Immediately, his eyes fly wide open, and he stares in shock at the tuber. He looks back and forth between me and his food, looking like I’d tricked him somehow. Tilting his head in confusion, he takes another bite.\n\n\n “…This is good! What is this?! This tastes totally different from the boiled kalfe root we eat at home!”\n\n\n “It’s because they’re steamed. All the nutrients and flavor are locked in there by the steam. Today, since we steamed them with the tronbay too, it picked up the flavor of that too, like if we smoked it, so it has a really luxurious sort of taste.”\n\n\n While we gleefully dig into our kalfe roots, I tell Lutz about what what happened last night while we were working on the hairpins.\n\n\n “…So, yeah, Tory and Mommy were really amazing last night. They’re really fired up about tonight, too. I couldn’t even get one done, though, so I got reminded about how useless I really am, hah.”\n\n\n “Don’t get too proud.”\n\n\n “How about you, Lutz? How’d it go?”\n\n\n Lutz, who’s finished his entire kalfe root already, sadly licks the last remnants from his fingers, then shakes his head grimly.\n\n\n “Nobody seemed to have any interest in anything I was doing, so even when I asked them for help, they all just pretended to ignore me.”\n\n\n “I see. Well, how about I come to your house today and cast my magic spell?”\n\n\n “Magic spell?”\n\n\n “Yup! Once we get our money from Mister Benno, I’ll go home with you, so look forward to it!”\n\n\n Now that we’re done eating, I ask Lutz to draw some water from the well, then wash my hands and rinse out my mouth. Then, I take out the calculator that I’d brought and set it in front of Lutz.\n\n\n “Ummm, so, today, we have four completed hairpins to sell.” Since we’re discussing business, I make sure to speak clearly and politely for Lutz. “Yesterday, Mister Benno paid us for one in advance, so today we will be paid for three. Each hairpin earns us eleven medium copper coins. Now then, how much money will we make today?”\n\n\n As I explain the problem, Lutz listens with a serious expression, moving his fingers across the beads of the calculator.\n\n\n “Thirty-three!”\n\n\n “Correct! Well done, Lutz! Next, we’ve already established that you need to make twenty total pins. Yesterday, you made five. How many do you have left to make?”\n\n\n As I thought, Lutz gets frustrated when doing calculations that involve carrying or borrowing numbers, even when he has a calculator to help him, because they can’t be done immediately. If he can’t learn how to do single-digit calculations automatically in his head, these things will take a while even if he has a calculator, so for now I take away the calculator, write a bunch of numbers on my slate, and have him start working on practicing addition.\n\n\n “Let’s just work on memorizing this,” I say, speaking casually again. “You gotta get fast enough at this that you can answer immediately when asked something.”\n\n\n Lutz grumbles, but gets to work studying. Meanwhile, I sit down next to him and work on finishing up my hairpin. By the time it’s done, it’s nearly noon, and the tronbay has finished steaming.\n\n\n “Lutz, once I get each of these in the water, take them out please.”\n\n\n One by one, I use my chopsticks to place the steamed sticks of tronbay into the tub full of water from the well. They hiss with steam as I push them down into the water, then Lutz takes them out and puts them onto a nearby board. Since this isn’t flowing river water, the water in the tub quickly warms up.\n\n\n “The water’s getting pretty warm,” says Lutz. “One sec.”\n\n\n While I wait for Lutz to draw fresh water from the well to refill the tub, I sit down and start working on stripping bark from each stick. Once the tub is full, I go back to soaking new sticks. This repeats for some time. After all of the wood has been removed from the steamer, I steadily keep working on stripping bark while the wood is still warm, and Lutz cleans up the pot and steamer. Finally, we hang the strips of bark from nails in the warehouse to dry, and our work for the day is complete.\n\n\n “Woohoo, all done!”\n\n\n “Alright, cleanup’s all done too!”\n\n\n Since I’d been stripping hot bark for so long, even after hanging everything out to dry my fingers are still prickling with heat. The cool air feels really nice on them right now. I take in a deep breath, filling my lungs with the cool, crisp air.\n\n\n “…Huh?”\n\n\n I’m not despairing over anything. I’m not anxious about anything. All I feel right now is the relief and sense of freedom you feel after finishing a difficult task.\n\n\n Even still, the devouring fever rages within me. Reflexively, I turn all of my strength inwards, focusing on pinning it down again.\n\n\n “Whoa, Maine?!”\n\n\n Since I’ve suddenly gone rigid in front of him, Lutz shakes me frantically. I want to tell him that I’m trying to concentrate and that I want him to stop, but I’m struggling so hard against the pain that I can’t form any words. I shakily reach out my right hand and catch one of his. He grabs onto it tightly with both hands.\n\n\n “What the…? You’re burning up?! Maine, are you alright? Can you hear me?!”\n\n\n I focus on my tightly-squeezed hand, struggling to shut down the fever as I’ve done so many times before. Even though I’ve been imagining building a strong wall around my inner core to keep it shut in, this time a fragment of it managed to penetrate straight through.\n\n\n Get back in there!\n\n\n I manage to force the last embers of it back down into the depths of my heart, but I think this time is the longest it’s ever taken me.\n\n\n Immediately after my fever goes away, I’m suddenly weighed down by fatigue so heavy that I don’t even want to move my mouth to speak. I don’t really have the strength to stand anymore, so I sit down on the spot. Lutz, still holding tightly to my hand, is pulled along, crouching beside me.\n\n\n “Huh? Your fever… went down? What the hell is this? Hey! Maine! Are you okay?!”\n\n\n “…That was… the devouring. You know, the thing Frieda was talking about?”\n\n\n I let out an enormous sigh as I answer, and Lutz frowns worriedly.\n\n\n “Wait, hang on. You’re saying that there’s no sign at all that you’re suddenly about to get really sick?”\n\n\n “It comes really quickly. Until now, it’s only happened when I’m feeling really strong emotions, but lately even the tiniest flicker of emotion seems to let it out… man, that startled me.”\n\n\n I really was startled, but I picked such an ordinary word to finish that off with to try to lessen the raw shock of it all. Lutz, though, still looks like he’s almost about to cry, still clutching my hand tightly. Trying to give him at least a little peace of mind, I smile broadly up at him.\n\n\n “Is there… anything you can do?”\n\n\n “…Frieda told us already, didn’t she? It takes a huge amount of money. Mister Benno said the same thing.”\n\n\n The blood instantly drains from his face, leaving him white as a sheet.\n\n\n “And, since that’s that, shall we go to Mister Benno’s shop now so that we can earn a little money?”\n\n\n I show him a happy smile, hiding the honest fact that putting in any large amount of physical effort would be intensely difficult. Lutz clenches his teeth tightly, then lets go of my hand and spins around so that his back is facing me.\n\n\n “I’ll carry you to the shop. …It’s all I can do, after all.”\n\n\n “It’s all you can do? Don’t you already do a lot for me, though?”\n\n\n “Argh, just get on!”\n\n\n I hear a quaver in his voice as he’s urging me on. I pretend not to hear it, though, and lean against his back, draping my arms over his shoulders.\n\n\n Man, I’m beat, I think to myself.\n\n\n Back when I was Urano, living life without ever looking up from my books, I’d never had a friend who’d cry for me like this. I don’t know if saying anything now is the right thing to do here. I’ve read about it in books, but I’m still not sure at all.\n\n\n Lutz, you’re too kind. No matter how useless I am, you stay with me. I’m not even the real Maine, and you know that, but you’ve forgiven me.\n\n\n “If I ever pass out from the devouring, Lutz, it’s not your fault at all. It really, really does come without any warning. …And there’s no way I’m gonna lose anytime soon. I haven’t made a single book yet.”\n\n\n I can hear Lutz sniffle, but he doesn’t reply."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “If I ever pass out from the devouring, Lutz, it’s not your fault at all. It really, really does come without any warning. …And there’s no way I’m gonna lose anytime soon. I haven’t made a single book yet.”\n\n\n Maine’s voice is quiet, right next to my ear, as she tries to reassure me.\n\n\n I don’t want her to see my miserable, crying face, so I’m carrying her on my back. However, since I’m doing so, I don’t have a free hand to wipe the tears running down my face. One by one, the teardrops fall onto Maine’s sleeve, leaving little wet spots.\n\n\n I want to help her, but I can’t. I can only grit my teeth at how powerless I am.\n\n\n Maine always keeps saying that she’s completely useless, but I don’t know what I’d do without her.\n\n\n When I said I wanted to become a trader, my family disregarded it completely, telling me not to be ridiculous, but Maine just smiled and told me to follow my dream. When I was first introduced to Benno, I was so terrified that I wanted to flee on the spot, but Maine held my hand and helped me through it. When there wasn’t anything I could do on my own, Maine stuck with me, helping me think and helping me act so that I could become an apprentice. Even now, when I’m wondering if it’s even a good idea for me to become a merchant, Maine’s teaching me how to write, how to read numbers, how to do math, how to think about money… everything.\n\n\n And despite all that, there’s nothing I can do to help her when she’s suffering from the devouring.\n\n\n I don’t have the kind of money to help her. I’ve started to earn a little bit of money, but all that was things that she thought of. If I hadn’t helped her, if she was stronger, if she’d gotten more help from the adults, I wonder if she’d have been able to make paper a lot faster and earn a lot more money? If that’s the case, would she have made enough money to save herself?\n\n\n I can’t think about anything else. I’m so weak that I’m miserable, regretful… shameful.\n\n\n If I wasn’t a kid, if I was an adult, I wonder if I’d be able to help her? If I was a merchant like Master Benno, if I had that kind of money, maybe I…\n\n\n I swallow everything down, grit my teeth, and keep walking forward, Maine on my back. If there’s anyone who can help Maine, anyone who has enough influence and money to help Maine, I’ll find them at Benno’s.\n\n\n Master Benno will surely save Maine. He knows just how much the things Maine can make are worth, so I’m positive he’ll help.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n When we arrive at the store, Mark and Benno are lying in wait for us. Mark has a worried look on his face while Benno is scowling unpleasantly. Since I still haven’t been able to wipe away my tears, I hang my head low, not wanting them to see my soggy, miserable face. As I stare down at the ground, the tips of Benno’s shoes come into view.\n\n\n He sighs heavily. “…this kid.”\n\n\n I thought he’d just walked up to sigh at us, but suddenly all the weight disappeared from my back.\n\n\n “Eeek?!” cries Maine, startled.\n\n\n I snap my head up to see Benno hold Maine up roughly and then toss her over to Mark. My heart nearly jumps out of my chest when I see Maine hurtling through empty air.\n\n\n “Wh…?!”\n\n\n “Whoa?!” exclaims Mark.\n\n\n As soon as I’m sure that Mark’s caught her securely, I allow myself a moment of relief before turning to face Benno angrily. The instant before I start to yell “what are you doing to a sick little girl?!”, he jerks his chin towards the shop.\n\n\n “Lutz, let’s go. You and me.”\n\n\n I open and close my mouth wordlessly, my fervor suddenly evaporating, then follow Benno into the shop. As I try to convince myself that there’s no problem entrusting her to Mark, or at least that it’s far better than letting Benno take care of her, I hear the door close behind me and frantically wipe my face clean with my sleeve.\n\n\n Benno motions to the table we always use. As soon as I sit down, he fixes his glimmering, reddish-brown eyes on me. He studies me from head to toe, then opens his mouth.\n\n\n “…Was it the devouring?”\n\n\n “How did you…”\n\n\n “Despite the fact that you were carrying her, Maine seemed to be doing pretty well. I thought that her fever must have suddenly spiked and then gone down again just as suddenly. You’re together all the time, but is this your first time seeing that?”\n\n\n I nod, gulping. Even though I’ve been by Maine’s side whenever we went to the forest, went to the store, and worked on making paper, this is my first time actually seeing the symptoms of the devouring manifest.\n\n\n There wasn’t a single sign that her condition was worsening, but suddenly she got a fever so hot that I wondered if her body was going to melt. Something wispy and yellow drifted off from her, like steam rising from her whole body. It was astoundingly terrifying.\n\n\n “Master Benno, please, help Maine. I can’t do anything. I’m just a kid, I don’t have any money, I can’t do anything…”\n\n\n “I can’t.”\n\n\n In a quiet voice, Benno immediately shoots down my request.\n\n\n “Why?! You’re a grown-up, you have money, you do a lot of business with the noblemen…”\n\n\n As I desperately make my argument, Benno’s face twists as if in pain, or regret. Grinding his teeth, he shakes his head.\n\n\n “I told you my business was rapidly growing. When it comes to trading with the nobility, I’m a newcomer on the scene, relatively speaking. I don’t have many connections. I’m still at a point where they see me as someone at their feet, ready to be ripped off. …I can’t do anything, either.”\n\n\n “Master Benno… even you can’t…?”\n\n\n I’m left speechless by Benno’s completely unexpected words. Benno, who owns this huge shop, who does business with the nobility, is saying that he’s powerless to help Maine; is curing the devouring completely impossible? As everything in front of me starts to grow dim, I remember the one person I know of who has been cured.\n\n\n “But, I thought Frieda was cured… then maybe the guild leader…!”\n\n\n “I already talked with him.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n Benno takes a shallow breath, then reaches up to scratch at his head. A wry, sarcastic smile floats over his troubled face, and he shrugs.\n\n\n “He said that, if you have money, you can temporarily stave it off. Since he’s willing to spend any amount of money so that his granddaughter could keep living, he’s been working with a disgraced noble family this entire time, constantly paying them to use a broken magical tool. Using it just once costs him two small gold coins.”\n\n\n “G… gold?!”\n\n\n When I got the one small silver coin for selling that paper, I’d been so thrilled at how much money I’d just earned, but it seems like Maine needs gold, not just silver. The thought of such an unattainable amount of money makes my head spin.\n\n\n “However, even that’s only enough to buy about a half year’s worth of time. Even if I spent that much money once to keep her alive, I’d have to spend it again before you know it. Maine, especially, is very young. As she grows up, the symptoms of the devouring are only going to get worse, and more and more frequent. You think I have that much money to spend on a single apprentice? It’s impossible, for me.”\n\n\n If what Benno’s saying is right, then it really is impossible. There’s no way he’d be able to spend that kind of money. However, just saying it’s impossible and giving up is giving up on Maine’s life.\n\n\n “There’s not much I can do,” he says. “I can buy the unusual knowledge that she has from her, giving her some gold to make up for it. When it starts to get too bad to deal with, I’ll probably hand her over to that old bastard. …So, what can you do?”\n\n\n Benno stares at me with sharp, predatory eyes. Without thinking about it, I glare back at him. He’s an adult, with power, brains, money, and everything, and he still can’t do anything to help Maine. What could I possibly do?\n\n\n “…I can’t do anything at all. I’m just a kid. I’m not strong, I’m not smart, I don’t have any money… if there’s something I can do, tell me, please.”\n\n\n “Don’t make her have to look after you. Don’t make her worry.”\n\n\n “Wh…?!”\n\n\n His immediate response makes my breath catch in my through. He’s hit the target so cleanly that I have no way to respond at all. My eyes grow hot with chagrin. Benno’s facial expression softens a just a little bit, but his eyes are still sharp as he opens his mouth to speak.\n\n\n “Listen up, Lutz. That kid out there is not the little girl she seems to be. At the very least, even when she’s suffering, she doesn’t want to make you worry, so she puts on a brave smile for you. Make sure you don’t let her trick you with that.”\n\n\n I remember that after the devouring fever went back down down, when her breathing was still heavy and ragged, she had a bright, happy smile on her face. Seeing her smiling like that really did make me feel relieved, but it looks like maybe that was a mistake.\n\n\n “You’re a man, so don’t give her anything else to worry about. You can’t pretend like you don’t know anything, so cooperate with her so that she can buy herself a little more time to live. If you’re going to say grandiose things like ‘I’m going to make whatever Maine comes up with’, then take every single one of her ideas, make them, and sell them! If you’ve got time to cry, then you’ve got time to think. You’ve got time to work. Make some money!”\n\n\n “…Alright.”\n\n\n I raise my head, full of determination, and Benno’s lips stretch into a broad grin.\n\n\n “Now that’s the right kind of face, hm?”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Oh, Lutz!” says Maine. “You done with your conversation? Look, look! I finished up getting us paid for the hairpins we brought today.”\n\n\n She’s smiling, as usual, as I come out of Benno’s office to meet her. She has a very carefree expression on, but when I remember Benno’s advice and look more closely I can see that despite her smile there’s a hint of worry in her eyes. Feeling like I should be scolding myself for making her worry, I put on a smile, refusing to be defeated.\n\n\n “That’s a lot,” I enthuse.\n\n\n “I think we’ll be good for about two or three more days with this.”\n\n\n “Two or three?!”\n\n\n “Honestly, I have no idea just how far my mother’s going to rampage through this project, and Tory’s just as fired up as my mother is…”\n\n\n As we banter back and forth, I can see Maine start to loosen up, bit by bit. I think I probably managed to give her a little bit of peace of mind. Behind me, Benno comes out of his office with his usual stern expression, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\n “Don’t just chit-chat in my shop. If you’re done with your business here, then go straight home and, Maine, get right to bed. Lutz says you’re not a hundred percent right now.”\n\n\n As Benno waves his hands to shoo us out of his shop, he seems to suddenly think of something and amends his previous statement.\n\n\n “Mark, go with these two. It’s dangerous for kids like these to be walking around with that kind of money.”\n\n\n “Certainly, sir.”\n\n\n In order to make it easy to pay Tory and the others, Maine got all of the money in medium copper coins. Since there’s thirty-three of them, they’ll probably jangle loudly when we walk around. If unbaptized children such as ourselves carry around that kind of money, then, of course, we’d be incredibly conspicuous.\n\n\n Now that the danger of being robbed or attacked has been pointed out to her, Maine forgoes her usual “no thank you, it’s all right” routine and obediently offers the bag of money to Mark. Mark exchanges a brief look with Benno, then reaches down to pick up both the bag and Maine herself.\n\n\n “I–I can walk on my own!!”\n\n\n “Were you not just carried here by Lutz, Maine? You’re such a good girl, so please come along quietly so that the rest of us can rest easily.”\n\n\n “Nnngh…”\n\n\n Maine, having lost any means of resistance, stops struggling and just hangs her head. It seems like she doesn’t have any way to fight against Mark’s gentle words.\n\n\n This is a good discovery. I should work quickly to learn how to talk like Mark.\n\n\n On the way home, Maine and Mark discuss things like how to handle the winter handiwork and how to manage the finished products. I pay close attention, since I’m going to be doing the exact same thing too.\n\n\n I thought that we were going to go our separate ways when we reached the plaza with our water well, but Mark doesn’t put Maine down, saying that he’ll bring the money all the way to her home and explain things to her family. I part ways with the two of them, deeply appreciative of how considerate Mark is.\n\n\n “Lutz, I’ll stop by later,” says Maine.\n\n\n I wave goodbye at them as they head into the building, then I turn towards my own home. My feet suddenly feel like lead weights as I drag myself forwards.\n\n\n “I’m home,” I say, as I close the door behind me.\n\n\n “What, empty handed today?”\n\n\n Zasha, my oldest brother, looks me up and down, raising an eyebrow. For unbaptized kids like me, going to gather things from the forest is effectively a full-time job, but since I’ve lately been going to Benno’s shop a lot, I haven’t been able to do enough gathering. My family, I know, doesn’t actually care about the circumstances why.\n\n\n “Seriously. You didn’t even go earn any money, huh?”\n\n\n If I’d come back with some money, things might have been a little better, but only a little. Ralph really doesn’t like how much money I’ve made in such a short period of time, and lately he’s been really strict with me.\n\n\n I put my things in my room, lie down on my bed, and let out a long sigh. Ever since I started saying that I wanted to be a merchant, everyone in my family has been uncomfortably icy towards me. I know that if I just said I was going to give up on that and be a craftsman instead, things would instantly improve, but I also know that I’d regret that forever.\n\n\n Knock, knock!\n\n\n “Good afternoon, Miss Carla. Is Lutz here?”\n\n\n “Oh, Maine! It’s good to see you. I just heard him come home a little while ago… Lutz, Maine’s here!”\n\n\n At the sound of my mother’s voice, all of my older brothers immediately rush forward, dragged by Maine’s invisible grip on their stomachs. By the time I manage to make it out of my room, she’s already been completely surrounded to the point that I can’t even see her anymore.\n\n\n “What’s up? Do you have a new recipe?”\n\n\n “I’ll help! What do you need?”\n\n\n “Nuh-uh,” she says, “not today. I’m just here to pay Lutz what I owe him.”\n\n\n “You owe him?”\n\n\n “Yep! He helped me with my winter handiwork, so I owe him for that.”\n\n\n Maine squeezes her way out of the crowd and walks up to me, with the kind of self-satisfied smirk she gets when she’s scheming something. “Lutz, your hand, please,” she says, and I stick it out. Then, she exaggeratedly places coins into the palm of my hand, one by one.\n\n\n “You helped with five pins, so I owe you five medium copper coins. One, two, three, four, five. That’s right, right?”\n\n\n “Yeah.”\n\n\n The coins clink against each other as she places them into my hand, and I’m suddenly aware that the gazes of all of my older brothers are firmly fixed to the spot. My palm seems to tingle under the pressure of their stares, and I hear someone gulp nervously.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine. You said Lutz helped you, was that those sticks he was making yesterday?”\n\n\n Maine, waiting for Ralph to say those exact words, puts on a sweet, but very, very forced, smile.\n\n\n “That’s right! I’m making hairpins, so I asked him to help with the pin part. One pin is one medium copper coin.”\n\n\n “That’s worth that much?!”\n\n\n Zasha’s eyes fly wide open, staring again at the coins in my palm. Zeke, his doubts seemingly erased now that he actually sees me holding money, takes a sharp breath and looks over at Maine.\n\n\n “…Does it have to be Lutz that does it? Can I help too?”\n\n\n Zeke is the one to ask the question, but it’s on all of my brothers’ minds. All of them turn to look at her. She looks back at them easily, smiling and nodding.\n\n\n “No, it doesn’t really have to be Lutz. But, they need to be a specific size, and they need to be polished really smooth so that they don’t catch in anyone’s hair, so it’s not really casual work, you know?”\n\n\n As soon as my brothers hear those words, they all scramble to be the first to talk themselves up.\n\n\n “Maine, Maine. I’m way better at woodworking and carpentry than Lutz is. I do it every day at my job, you know.”\n\n\n “Me, I’m definitely better than Lutz.”\n\n\n “If we’re talking about experience, then I’ve got the most of it, right?”\n\n\n Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, guys. Who was it yesterday that told me I should go off and make those boring little sticks all by myself?\n\n\n “Oh man, I can’t believe we were so stupid yesterday!”\n\n\n “Lutz, why didn’t you tell us you were getting paid for these?”\n\n\n “Were you going to hog all the money for yourself?”\n\n\n I’m pretty sure I told them about it, but they probably ignored me, thinking I was making things up. My brothers’ memories have been repainted by the power of cold, hard cash, making me into the bad guy here. All of my brothers are staring at me with a dangerous look in their eyes, and I’m suddenly extremely aware of how terrifying money can be. As my brothers start closing in around me, Maine claps her hands together.\n\n\n “So, would you three make them for me, then? I’d need five from each of you. If you make more than that, I won’t be able to use them. I’ll be back in three days to get them, okay?”\n\n\n “Yeah, leave it to me!”\n\n\n “I don’t even need three days.”\n\n\n “I can do them right away.”\n\n\n Maine holds up a single finger, grinning impishly.\n\n\n “Precision is more important than speed! If you don’t make them exactly, I won’t be able to use them and you’ll have to redo them. …Oh, right! You should ask Lutz about how big they need to be and what kind of wood you should be using. Okay then, I’ll see you guys in three days to pick these up!”\n\n\n My brothers, with big smiles on their faces, wave to Maine as she heads out the door. The instant the door shuts behind her, though, their attitudes immediately change. They grab onto me tightly and drag me to our room.\n\n\n “So, what kind of wood do we need?”\n\n\n “How big are they?”\n\n\n “You’re not getting anything this time, heh.”\n\n\n Their tools are already in their hands as they close in around me, demanding an explanation. I’m left dumbfounded by their complete and utter turnaround from yesterday, where they didn’t even bother paying attention to what I was doing.\n\n\n “Don’t just stand there!”\n\n\n “Tell us, quickly!”\n\n\n “O… okay!”\n\n\n I answer all the questions they have about the kinds of wood and how to make them, and they immediately set to work. In the blink of an eye, I’ve been completely tossed aside. Then, most frustratingly, my brothers start immediately churning out beautiful hairpins, far faster than I could have made them, thanks to their job experience.\n\n\n Ah. Is this how Maine feels when she’s always saying she isn’t good for anything?\n\n\n I, having been forgotten in a corner, get out my slate and calculator. This is something that I should be doing. I can leave the crafting to the craftsmen.\n\n\n On our way home, Maine had told me to do three things.\n\n\n First, on a board, I should make a note of the number of pins that we make. Then, I should make sure that I keep that board hidden securely, so that nobody can arbitrarily add more to it. Lastly, I should use my calculator to work out what my total commission on these is, remembering that my commission for each pin is four medium copper coins.\n\n\n “Aha, done!”\n\n\n “Man, I’m way ahead of you.”\n\n\n “Ralph, that looks kinda sloppy. If you don’t do it right, Maine can’t use it, right?”\n\n\n From the sounds of it, my brothers have started competing to see who can make them the best.\n\n\n “Lutz, how’s this look?”\n\n\n “…Yeah, that looks great! Good job, Zasha.”\n\n\n Zasha has finished one, so I’ve made four coins.\n\n\n “Look, I’m done too!”\n\n\n “That’s perfect, Zeke!”\n\n\n Zeke finished another, so now I’m up to eight.\n\n\n While I’m sitting here practicing my writing, I’m not actually making anything myself, but when see my commission fees steadily ticking up on my calculator I suddenly understand.\n\n\n Now this is being a merchant, huh? Now that I’ve seen the power of money firsthand, my desire to know how to handle it well has only been strengthened."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n It’s been three days since Lutz’s older brothers promised to make hairpin parts for me. Today is the day I go to pick them up.\n\n\n During those three days, I didn’t leave the house at all, spending my hours working on making tiny little flowers. Since the devouring fever has been very active lately, roiling about in my body, I’ve not been feeling particularly good, so I haven’t really wanted to go outside at all. I’ve even been attacked by the fever in the middle of the night, leaving me exhausted and sluggish the next morning. Honestly, since I have no idea when or where the devouring is going to strike next, I’m feeling kind of uneasy about how I could collapse at any time.\n\n\n While secluded at home for the last few days, I managed to complete enough flowers for two hairpins. If you include the one I made before, I was only able to make three out of the whole twenty. All the rest were made by my mother and Tory. The sheer difference in speed is pretty depressing. The two of them, as before, seemed to race against each other while making their flowers. Tory’s speed has improved immensely by now, and between the two of them they made twelve more pins’ worth of flowers over the last three days. Right now, they’ve split up the work to get the last pin finished.\n\n\n “I’m gonna go over to Lutz’s house now. I gotta go pick up the pins and give them their money,” I say.\n\n\n “Have fun,” say the two of them, in monotone unison. Neither of them even look up, they’re so engaged in their work.\n\n\n I put fifteen medium copper coins in a small coin purse and walk out the front door. I head down the stairs, exit the building, walk through the water well plaza, start climbing the stairs of the building that’s basically in the front.\n\n\n Lutz’s home is on the sixth floor, but they’ve rented two floors’ worth of space. There’s lots of stairways, and going up and down them is really difficult, but the interior is spacious. Even though there’s four boys living there, it’s not actually that cramped. Lutz, however, says that it’s full of all sorts of craftsman’s tools and there’s a lot of space set aside for work, so it’s not really as big as it sounds.\n\n\n I knock on the door and announce myself, and after a moment the door swings open with a creak, revealing Auntie Carla.\n\n\n “Good afternoon, Auntie Carla. Are the boys home? I’m here to pick up some handiwork that I asked them to make for me.”\n\n\n “They are!” she says, beaming. “They’ve been waiting restlessly for you all morning.”\n\n\n Once she says that, her face darkens a bit. She furtively glances around a bit, then leans in, speaking in a lower voice.\n\n\n “…Hey, Maine. Lutz is really serious about being a merchant, isn’t he? He’s being very stubborn, so the mood in the house has been pretty bad lately. Even still, he doesn’t look like he’s going to back down. Wanting to be a merchant isn’t something to tear up a family over! Don’t you agree?”\n\n\n I’d already heard from Lutz that things weren’t going particularly well for him at home, but this looks more serious than I’d thought. He may be worried, but Lutz does not back down. After all, he’s already made up his mind that he’s going to be a live-in apprentice if he has to.\n\n\n “I don’t think I can answer that, Auntie Carla. Lutz is the one who’d make that decision, you know?”\n\n\n An outsider like me butting into a parent-child dispute is only going to sow more discord, so I just tilt my head doubtfully to one side. Carla, having not gotten the agreement she was looking for, frowns sourly, her lips pointed.\n\n\n “Well, I guess you’re right. If I’d had a girl, she’d do what her parents said, but boys just don’t listen to anything. They’re so disagreeable.”\n\n\n Well, as for me, I have no real intention of living my life like my parents want me to. I’ll just keep that to myself, though.\n\n\n Auntie Carla’s grumblings show no signs of stopping. Her sons, very much used to how troublesome their mother’s ranting could be, stay out of sight lest they get dragged up into it, and Auntie Carla hasn’t yet invited me inside. I should just politely agree with her and head her off before she gets really going. Unlike the older ladies who are more than willing to have long conversations outside by the water well as snow piles up around them, I have no particular desire to stand here and chat in this freezing entranceway.\n\n\n “It must be rough living with four boys, Auntie Carla.”\n\n\n “It is! And they don’t even appreciate how hard they’re making it on me. You know, the other day…”\n\n\n Ahh… crap. I have a feeling I’m going to be out here forever.\n\n\n At about the time I start to wonder if I should just start over entirely, I hear Lutz call out from within the house.\n\n\n “Hey, Mom. Didn’t Maine come to pick up that handiwork? She needs to get it before the snow starts falling, so I think she’s in a bit of a rush. It’s also really easy for her to get sick, so let her in, please!”\n\n\n “Ah, that’s right. Come in, Maine.”\n\n\n “Thank you,” I say.\n\n\n Lutz and I exchange glances. You seriously saved me, thank you so much, I say silently. Sorry my mom talks so much, he replies.\n\n\n Finally, I’m able to enter Lutz’s house. It really is warm in here compared to outside.\n\n\n “Lutz,” I say, “did your big brothers finish their work? And did you make sure to practice your math?”\n\n\n “Yeah.”\n\n\n “…Maine, are you perhaps the one teaching Lutz how to do math?”\n\n\n Lutz’s mother, seemingly having listened in on our conversation, asks that question in a somewhat pointed voice. There’s an undercurrent of “don’t make my life any more difficult” buried in there, which I completely disregard, instead turning to smile up at her.\n\n\n “Yeah! I’ve been helping with math at the gates.”\n\n\n “Ahh, you’ve been helping your father, then? That’s so wonderful. It would be really nice, though, if Lutz would help his father out with his own apprenticeship.”\n\n\n In this world, a young girl generally helps her parents out with their work until she gets married to a boy that her parents introduce her to. Then, she helps her husband with his work. If she were in a rural farming area, she’d be helping out with farm work, so she’d marry a farmer.\n\n\n In other words, while I, the daughter of a soldier, have been studying various things, others have had the expectation that it’s so that I can eventually become the kind of wife that can support a soldier. It is actually really difficult to be the wife of a soldier, with their irregular work hours and such, and whether or not she’s able to adapt to it depends largely on if there are other soldiers in the family and if she already understands what the job entails.\n\n\n I wonder if Carla had heard that my father is letting me help him out at the gate to help me with my future prospects? Unfortunately, I’m rocketing along the path towards my merchant’s apprenticeship, and have not even the tiniest shred of an intention of becoming the wife of a soldier.\n\n\n As I head deeper into the house, Lutz’s brothers are lying in wait, gripping hairpins in each hand. When I get close, they all simultaneously stand up, shoving their fistfuls of pins in my face.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine! Take a look.”\n\n\n “I got these done in no time at all.”\n\n\n “I think these are perfect!”\n\n\n “W-whoa!” I stammer. “Line up! By year!”\n\n\n Having a whole bunch of sharpened hairpins thrust into my face is actually terrifying. I wave my hands frantically as I dodge out of the way. In a flash, the three of them line up in order of age, just like I asked. One by one, I examine each hairpin and deliver them their pay. Not a single step had been skipped. The smooth finish and expert craftsmanship causes a smile to float across my face.\n\n\n “All three of you did way better than Lutz did! You really are professionals. Tory and Mommy are better than me at what I’m making at home, too. Hey, guys! Do you think I could ask you to help me with my handiwork this winter, too? I’d have to wait to pay you until the spring, but the pay would be the same.”\n\n\n “Yeah, leave it to us!”\n\n\n The three older brothers agreed to the work with big smiles. Thanks to the fact that they’re going to be doing the actual handiwork, Lutz should be free to focus all of his efforts on studying.\n\n\n “Lutz, did you do the calculations? How much is it?”\n\n\n “Six thousand leon, so six large copper coins. …Is that right?”\n\n\n This time, Lutz’s older brothers made fifteen pin parts. Since each one makes him four medium copper coins, that’s six large copper coins in total. He’s making a killing just off of the commission.\n\n\n “Yep, that’s perfect! Let’s keep practicing calculations like that. I’m gonna go bring these home now and finish them up; how does going to Mister Benno’s shop tomorrow sound?” “Sounds good to me.”\n\n\n By the time I gather up the pins and return home, the final decorations have been completed. I work with Tory and my mother to sew everything together and finish off each pin.\n\n\n “I’m gonna go bring these to the shop tomorrow and bring back the rest of the money, okay? You guys were so fast, I couldn’t keep up with the amount of money I already had.”\n\n\n When I’d originally asked Benno to give me some money in advance, I thought that we’d wind up delivering only ten hairpins. I’m actually kind of shocked that we managed to make twenty. Both my mother’s raw determination in the face of money and Tory’s massive speed increase were far beyond anything I could have imagined.\n\n\n “Heh heh, I’m getting pretty fast, aren’t I?”\n\n\n “Yeah, Tory, you’re amazing! We’ll be able to make so many of these this winter.”\n\n\n “Right! Let’s work hard and make a bunch!”\n\n\n I must tip my hat towards Tory, who is walking steadily along the road of becoming a sewing beauty. I simply cannot compare.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, Lutz and I head for Benno’s shop, completed hairpins in hand. As we walk along the cobbled road, Lutz asks me a question.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine. Do you have any other things you can to sell?”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n “Master Benno told me that if you wanted to do anything about the devouring, you need a lot of money. When we start selling paper in the spring, it looks like we’ll sell it for a really high price, though, but if you had anything else, then… If you think of something, I’ll make it, after all.”\n\n\n Seeing the honest worry in his face, I start to think if there’s any new products I could come up with to do something about the devouring.\n\n\n “Hmmm, let me thing. All the things I’ve come up with until now that can earn a lot of money are things aimed at wealthy people, huh.”\n\n\n It’s obvious that everyday necessities are goods that require spending constant amounts of money. Even the hairpins, though, if we increase the quality of the thread and change the designs, the pricing will be way different, and paper made from the very rare tronbay will be more expensive as well. As such, if we want to make a ton of money, what we need are products that the upper class are likely to want.\n\n\n “I don’t really have a clue what wealthy people want, though. Rinsham, hairpins, and paper are all things that used to be all around me.”\n\n\n “Man, your world must have been amazing…”\n\n\n Lutz, who’s fully aware of the fact that I have memories that aren’t just Maine’s, is not only not creeped out by it, but is actually interested. So, when it’s just the two of us talking, that’s the only time I don’t have to keep my memories of Japan purposefully concealed.\n\n\n As I’ve only become more and more nostalgic about it, I haven’t been able to say anything but the most amazing things about it, so I think the image Lutz has of Japan is that of an amazing utopia. To me, it certainly was a utopia compared to here, if only because of the proliferation of bookstores and libraries. Even now, if I could, I’d go back in a heartbeat.\n\n\n “I guess I could try taking hints from ‘dollar stores’ and think of things that could improve people’s daily lives? Maybe improving soap, or making more stylish candles? I made some herb candles last year, but I guess those might be a good idea.”\n\n\n “Herb candles?” asks Lutz, tilting his head to one side and frowning.\n\n\n “During last year’s winter preparations, the candles were extremely smelling, so I added herbs to some of them to try to eliminate the smell. I found some that smelled good, but I also found a bunch that synergized terribly and smelled awful, too. My mom told me not to mess with things I shouldn’t and forbade me from making them this year.”\n\n\n While I was laying in bed, I’d said that I wanted to make herb candles, but my mother immediately refused and strictly forbade me from leaving my bed. That was absolutely not just out of concern for my health, but probably much more that she was worried about the candles I’d make.\n\n\n “Man, you get in trouble a lot.”\n\n\n “Urgh… Trial and error is an indispensable part of making things! For some other ideas, my baskets and lacework were pretty popular, so I wonder if I could make some other kind of 'arts and crafts’… wait, no, 'arts and crafts’ aren’t usually very useful at all.”\n\n\n Even while casually dismissing my own idea, I dig through my memories from my Urano period for any useful sort of arts and crafts.\n\n\n “Hmmm, 'bead accessories’ won’t work since I don’t have any 'beads’, making art out of pressed flowers might technically work but I don’t think we could actually sell those, we can’t do 'tole painting’_1 since we don’t have paints… what do we do?”\n\n\n “I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about. In the end, what _can we do?”\n\n\n No matter what we make, we’ll need to start by making all the tools we’ll need for that, just like we did with the paper. When I think about that, all of my will to actually do any of that instantly vanishes. Honestly, if it’s not going to be something that can immediately improve my own life, I actually can’t summon up very much energy.\n\n\n “Ummm, I think my biggest problem right now for coming up with new products is that I really can’t get fired up for making a bunch of tools for things I won’t actually use in my own life.”\n\n\n “You have to!” yells Lutz. “Do you want to die?!”\n\n\n “It’s not that I’m not worried, it’s just that I’m not very enthusiastic for making things I don’t think are necessities, like, next up is a book…”\n\n\n “Hey, wait! You’re the only one actually saying that if you yourself don’t think something’s essential then nobody else is going to buy it! Think of something we can sell!”\n\n\n Lutz is a little teary-eyed, maybe from getting a bit too agitated. I pat him gently on the shoulder.\n\n\n “Lutz, you should calm down a bit.”\n\n\n “You’re the one making me agitated!”\n\n\n “Yeah, you’re right. Sorry, sorry.”\n\n\n As I soothe Lutz’s nerves, somebody suddenly grabs my head from above.\n\n\n “Aaah!”\n\n\n “Just what are the two of you talking about in the middle of the street? People are laughing; was that supposed to be funny?”\n\n\n When I hear the familiar sound of Benno’s voice, I look around my surroundings. Just as he says, I can hear people chuckling as they watch the two of us with small smiles. My face goes red with embarrassment, and I channel my urge to lash out angrily into a fierce glare up at him.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, why might you be here?”\n\n\n “I’m on my way back from the workshops. What about you two?”\n\n\n “We finished the hairpins and were going to deliver them to you.”\n\n\n “Ah, really? Then, let’s go.”\n\n\n Benno promptly picks me up and starts walking off at an impatiently brisk pace. From over his shoulder, I see Lutz having to jog to keep up.\n\n\n He doesn’t even put me down once we enter the shop, instead carrying me to his office and setting me next to our usual table. I climb up into a chair, then pull the hairpins from my tote bag, lining them up on the table in front of me.\n\n\n “Counting the ones we delivered before, this makes a total of twenty,” I say. “Please look them over.”\n\n\n “…Great, now I can sell hairpins, too. The baptismal ceremony is next Earth Day, so this is pretty urgent.”\n\n\n Since there’s nobody in my house with any connection with this season’s baptismal ceremony, I don’t particularly care about the details, so I nod politely without paying much attention to what he was actually saying. Then, I realize there was a new vocabulary word I hadn’t heard before.\n\n\n “…Hey, Lutz. What’s Earth Day?”\n\n\n “What?! What are you saying… Earth Day is… Earth Day, right?”\n\n\n Since it seems that Lutz can’t actually explain it, he passes the buck on to Benno. Benno sighs, then starts explaining it to me.\n\n\n “They’re the names of the days that constantly cycle around. Water Day, Sprout Day, Fire Day, Leaf Day, Wind Day, Fruit Day, and Earth Day, you know?”\n\n\n Huh? “You know,” he says, but I don’t actually now. This is literally the first time I’m hearing it. Are these the days of the week?\n\n\n “Spring is the season of water, when the snow melts and the sprouts start to grow. Summer is the season of fire, when the sun is the closest and the leaves are growing. Autumn is the season of wind, when the cold air is blowing and the fruits are ripe. Winter is the season of earth, when all life is sleeping. That’s why Earth Day is the day of rest, when we close the shop.\n\n\n Earth Day is basically Sunday then. Got it. Since my mother had days off on fixed intervals, I knew that the concept of days in a week technically existed, but since there’s no calendars in my home, my dad has an irregular schedule, and nobody ever actually mentioned any of the days by name, so I just didn’t know them. So, the days of the week have names? Perfect.\n\n\n \"Huh,” says Lutz, “I didn’t know that. I knew what the names were, but I didn’t know what they meant.”\n\n\n “That kind of discussion happens around baptism time. The baptismal ceremonies for each season happen on the first day of that season, so the winter ceremony is on Earth Day.”\n\n\n “Ah, I see.”\n\n\n Since there’s neither garbage pickup days nor any calendars, the average working person, in their day-to-day lives, doesn’t need to know about any other day besides their weekly day off. If the subject isn’t specifically brought up at all, you can live your life without needing to think about it.\n\n\n Even when making arrangements with people, we haven’t needed to use anything besides saying how many days in the future it’ll be. Perhaps that’s preferred over the days of the week because it’s easier for both parties to understand? From what Benno’s saying, this seems like it’s got primarily religious significance. Learning more about this subject makes me kind of uncomfortable, though, so I think it shouldn’t be a problem if I just leave it at that for now.\n\n\n “That’s enough about the names of days. How about we finish settling this account?”\n\n\n “Sure, it’s not like it’s particularly useful information, ordinarily.”\n\n\n We finalize the transaction. I take the money I owe Tory and my mother in medium copper coins, which I put in my coin purse, which then goes back in my tote bag. As for the rest of the money, I touch my card to Benno’s to add it to my savings.\n\n\n “There’s one more thing I’d like to talk to you about.”\n\n\n As I was packing up to leave, since our business was finished and I didn’t want to get in the way of Benno’s work, he grabs my arm to stop me.\n\n\n “Did you come up with any new product ideas? That’s what you were talking about on the way here, right?”\n\n\n I have no idea for just how long he’d been listening to our conversation, but judging from the fact that his eyes are brimming with expectation, I see that it was him who kindled Lutz’s sudden passion in coming up with new ideas.\n\n\n …Well, I do need the money, so it’s not like it’s that big of a problem.\n\n\n For the last few days, the devouring fever has been steadily growing more restless, and pinning it down has taken longer and been more exhausting each time. To be perfectly honest, I can’t be sure my body will last long enough for me to actually save up enough money. There’s no actual reason for me to openly say something so extremely pessimistic, so I shrug lightly shrug and decide to play along.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, can you think of any sorts of things that would sell for a lot of money? I think that if you want to make a lot of money, you need to sell something unusual or an expensive consumable item to the upper class.”\n\n\n “Sure, that’s a good start,” he says, nodding, with a hint of a wry smile.\n\n\n “If I’m selling something unusual, though,” I continue, “then it loses its meaning once everyone has it and it stops being unusual, but if someone uses a consumable item, that means they have to buy it again, so that’s something you can make money off of forever. …Now that I think about it, about the rinsham, you’re probably making a lot of money off of that, aren’t you?”\n\n\n “Yeah, you could say that.”\n\n\n All of the profits from the rinsham are exclusively Benno’s, so he says that with a broad, self-assured smile. Incidentally, the high-quality rinsham should be done as well, so he should be starting to sell it soon. If I can think of something like rinsham, I think it’ll earn quite a bit of money.\n\n\n “My gut feeling is that I should go with more beauty products after all, maybe? You can’t underestimate the passion of a beauty-conscious woman, you know.”\n\n\n Cosmetics are expensive. Even though they’re expensive, there are many women out there searching for products that suit them and will spend unreservedly on something that might make them a little more beautiful. I think that the nobility and upper class especially will be willing to shell out for effective products. Benno, perhaps having exactly the same idea I am, looks at me with glittering eyes, leaning forward across the table with anticipation.\n\n\n “What are you thinking?”\n\n\n “Ummm… personally, I want a high-quality, good smelling soap. After that, since a lot of these are used during the winter, I think candles that have a variety of different scents pretty popular, maybe? I feel like the herb candles I made last week would make a decent product. After that, this is something that I don’t need right now, but I think there would be solid demand for some kind of facial lotion.”\n\n\n As things come to mind, I count them off on my fingers, and soon I’m able to list off a few things that might be decent products to sell. Lutz’s eyes are shining too, now, as he looks eagerly at me.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine,” he says, “do you know how to make all those things?”\n\n\n “Ummm, I know enough to get started. It’s like the paper, getting the materials and the tools is going to be a big effort, and there’s going to be a lot of trial and error in order to get the fine details down…”\n\n\n “Alright, give it a shot!” says Benno, grinning broadly as he points right at me. This is the face of a merchant running profit calculations in his head.\n\n\n I mumble something to myself about counting chickens before they hatch, reaching up to rub at my temple.\n\n\n “Mister Benno,” I sigh, “it’s really easy to say 'give it a shot’, but that’s going to be all the way in the spring, and I don’t even know if I’ll even be able to leave the house then… wha?!”\n\n\n Honestly, will I be able to hold out until spring? That’s a risk, right? The instant the thoughts form in my head, the tight seal within me blasts wide open and the white-hot fever of the devouring surges out. It burns within me like a blazing pillar of fire. I can’t surround it and push it back away like usual, and in my brief moments of panicked confusion it roars out, consuming my entire body.\n\n\n “Oi, Maine!” yells Lutz, noticing this sudden disaster. He stands up, his expression changing in an instant.\n\n\n I find myself unable to put any real strength into my limbs, and I start to sway dangerously.\n\n\n With my body burning up from a fever that can’t be pushed away, I’m aware that I’m in the process of falling from my chair, but I can’t manage to stop myself.\n\n\n It’s only the fact that my field of view suddenly changes that makes me realize I’ve hit the ground. Even though I hit the ground with a heavy thud, the heat raging within my body far surpasses the pain of the impact, and I don’t feel it at all. My eyes, somehow still open, see two sets of feet rush up to me through the thick carpet.\n\n\n “Maine, are you okay?!”\n\n\n Lutz grabs my arms to shake me. He instantly lets go, surprised by the heat, but grabs on even tighter. Benno turns around to face the door, not wasting a moment before ringing the bell to call Mark.\n\n\n “Sh*t!” he yells. “Mark, get her to the old man’s right now!”\n\n\n “Hey!” yells Lutz. “Didn’t you say you were going to make a book?! Didn’t you say you can’t lose yet?! Maine!! Keep it toget…”\n\n\n “Mark, …urry… …e prepare…”\n\n\n Their shouts gradually fade into the distance until I have no idea what they’re saying anymore. Then, with a snap, I lose consciousness.\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. Tole painting is a kind of folk art that decorates wooden utensils and other objects."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Engulfed by this fever, I remember that this sensation of being slowly eaten away from the outside in is just like it was before. Just like before, I focus my willpower as best as I can, struggling to somehow push back the fever.\n\n\n I haven’t even made any books yet!\n\n\n Remembering how I dealt with it the last time it slipped out, I try to wrestle it back into my inner core, but, unlike the last time, it burns far too hot to do so. Although I push and I push, it refuses to budge a single inch.\n\n\n You’re in my way! Get back! There’s no way I’m going to die like this!\n\n\n As I flail stubbornly at the fever weighing down on me, suddenly, it starts to be pulled away in some direction. Just like a mound of dirt in a vacuum cleaner commercial, the fever surrounding me is sucked away with a roar.\n\n\n Yeah! Get the hell out!\n\n\n I shove more of the fever at the vacuum cleaner as it steadily sucks away. I’m thrilled at how quickly my fever is going down, so I throw glob after glob at it, but then suddenly, from somewhere, I hear something burst open with a loud bang. In that instant, the fever abruptly stops flowing away, and no matter how hard I throw, it just comes back.\n\n\n Huh? Did the vacuum cleaner… break?\n\n\n I suddenly realize that maybe I was the one to break it, having gotten carried away at cramming things into it.\n\n\n …Did I just do something awful? What do I do now?\n\n\n I drift lazily about in the much-reduced clouds of fever for a while, completely confused. Of course, there’s nobody around me at all, let alone anyone I can actually ask for an explanation.\n\n\n It looks like I’ve been saved, so let’s think about the rest of it later.\n\n\n Now that the raw heat of the fever has finally gone down, I immediately work to put it away. There’s only about half of it remaining, so, unlike before, I can gather it up in my core and seal it away without any particular difficulty. I cram it away into the depths of my heart like shoving old cardboard boxes into a closet and shut the door tightly behind it. Basking in the triumph of finally finishing this job, I feel my consciousness gradually start floating to the surface.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n When I open my eyes, I’m once again in a completely unfamiliar world. No, seriously. Although fighting against the devouring has left my body completely and utterly exhausted, my mind is as clear as it’s ever been. This isn’t a dream.\n\n\n Where am I?\n\n\n First off, it’s dark. My first thought is that it’s because the sun’s gone down, but on closer examination it’s more that the area around my head is dark. There’s a little more light down by my feet. So, once I take another look around to confirm what I’m seeing, I now understand that the ceiling, or, rather, the thick green cloth that covers most of my field of view, hangs down around the entire bed. The part of it at my feet has a separation running along it, looking like it could be opened like a curtain.\n\n\n This cloth is not the fluttery lace canopy around a fairy-tale princess’s bed, but a thick, heavy canopy designed to completely block out vision. Only rich people can afford to use cloth like this.\n\n\n Wait, maybe, did I get reincarnated as a noble this time?!\n\n\n The bed itself is completely different from my own. Unlike the straw mattress I usually sleep on, warm woolen sheets have been filled with something soft and cozy, like a thick, warm futon1. The texture is excellent, and it feels like it would be amazing to sleep in.\n\n\n Back in my Urano days, I had a spring mattress with a quilted top and some very high-quality blankets, but this last year has completely reconfigured my views of what a bed feels like. As I’m lying here, the mattress isn’t rustling beneath me, nor is the pillow beneath my head as I’m looking around. There is no straw poking itchily at me through the sheets, either. This feels rather strange.\n\n\n Straw mattresses can be warm, too. Once you get used to them, you can even sleep through being bitten by the ticks and the mites. Yep, once you get used to them. Oooh, it’s been so long since I’ve been on a mattress this good. I just want to sleep a little longer like this.\n\n\n The bed I share with Tory is so small that I have to take great care when I’m turning over in your sleep, but this bed is big enough that I can roll around and around with no problems at all. As I’m rolling around, I notice that there’s a chair and a small nightstand next to the desk, with a candlestick whose light has long since burned out. None of these things are anything that I’ve ever seen before.\n\n\n However, as I’m rolling around, something very familiar enters my field of view: my own hands and my own hair. I stretch my hands in front of me and pull my hair in front of my face, verifying that I have not, in fact, turned into someone who is not Maine.\n\n\n …So I haven’t reincarnated again, then. So, really, where am I?\n\n\n I dig through my memories, trying to remember what happened to me right before I lost consciousness. Now that I’m thinking about it, I do remember Benno saying something about contacting the guild leader, I think.\n\n\n “…Ah, so, maybe this is the guild leader’s house?”\n\n\n I think I remember hearing that the guild leader had a magic tool that could do something about the devouring, so this is almost certainly the guild leader’s house. The level of wealth here supports that theory, too.\n\n\n “Excuse me,” I call out, “is anyone there?”\n\n\n My body is still so heavy that I really don’t want to get up, but I should get a good grasp of the situation. From the edge of the bed, I slowly reach out my hand, pulling slightly on the hanging, curtain-like cloth. Soon, an unfamiliar person slips through the curtain, perhaps having heard my voice.\n\n\n “Uh, ummm…” I stall.\n\n\n “One moment, please, ma'am.”\n\n\n “Huh? S… sure.”\n\n\n Although I have no idea what’s going on, I still can’t move. I wrap myself in the blanket, and as I grow warmer, my eyelids start to droop.\n\n\n Oh, no, I’m getting sleepy again.\n\n\n When I start nodding off, I hear the sound of a door opening and closing, then the approach of soft footsteps. Just like a student hearing the teacher’s footsteps when dozing off in class, I’m instantly wide awake.\n\n\n “Maine, are you awake?”\n\n\n The curtains part, revealing a girl with pink pigtails. She steps inside the canopy, bringing a lit candle with her.\n\n\n “…Oh? Freida?”\n\n\n “Yes, it is I. How much of what happened to you might you remember, I wonder?”\n\n\n She sets the candle on the nightstand and seats herself on the chair next to the bedside. Since it seems we’re about to have a conversation, I start trying to sit up as well, but Freida reaches out to stop me.\n\n\n “The fever this time took quite a toll on your body. I don’t mind if you lie down.”\n\n\n “Thanks, Freida. Although, if I’m lying down like this while we’re talking, I think I might fall asleep, so…”\n\n\n I move my body, pushing myself up into a sitting position. Freida, with a wry smile, reminds me not to overdo it.\n\n\n “Ummm, what happened to me, huh? Well, I only really remember as much as when I was in Mister Benno’s shop, then the devouring came up and swallowed me. …Then I remember that there was way too much of it for me to deal with by myself, but it got sucked away somewhere, so… Freida, did you do something to help?”\n\n\n I’ve never experienced anything like that fever vanishing the way that it did. I think that what probably happened was that someone used a magic tool, like Benno said… and then while that was happening I broke the extremely expensive tool.\n\n\n The blood instantly drains from my face. In contrast, though, Freida gently nods her head.\n\n\n “That’s essentially correct. We crammed as much of it as we could fit inside a magic tool that was just about to break. It broke partway through, but I think your devouring fever must be very much lessened. How do you feel?”\n\n\n “Yeah, much better. Although, I heard magic tools are really expensive…”\n\n\n Although my face is ghastly pale, Freida smiles again, looking amused as she tells me just how much it costs.\n\n\n “That’s right. The one that broke just now was two small gold coins and eight large silver. Mister Benno said that you would pay for it, but, can you really, I wonder?”\n\n\n I can’t help but think that Benno, when buying that additional information about rinsham from me, already knew how much this was going to cost. It would be a little bit too conveniently exact, if that wasn’t the case.\n\n\n …Huh? Didn’t he open up his bid at two small gold coins, not three? If I hadn’t made him go higher, then…\n\n\n Feeling a little weird about that inconsistency, I nod towards Freida.\n\n\n “…I can pay.”\n\n\n “You really do have that much, huh… I underestimated you, Maine!”\n\n\n Freida’s eyes momentarily shine with amazement, but then she starts to sulk a little, her cheeks puffing out.\n\n\n “If you couldn’t pay, he was saying that you’d sign up to work at my shop. Grandfather said that he’d told Mister Benno that the tool would cost one small gold and two large silver coins, so I thought you definitely wouldn’t have enough. It seems that Mister Benno is one step ahead of me!”\n\n\n Good job, me, turning down that two-gold offer! Also, Benno, excellent call on raising your offer at the last minute! Working at the kind of shop that would try to trap people by misrepresenting the price of life-saving magical tools would give me ulcers!\n\n\n As I breathe a sign of relief, Freida looks at me, her lips pointed.\n\n\n “What that magic tool did… to use a metaphor, if you had a cup that was overflowing with water, it siphoned off some of the excess. There’s still water left in the cup, and as you keep growing, it’s only going to keep filling back up. Do you understand, I wonder?”\n\n\n “Yes.”\n\n\n There was more half a year ago than a year ago, more last month than half a year ago, and more just now than last month. The devouring fever steadily became harder and harder to handle, and it’s only become manageable now thanks to the magic tool absorbing some of it. There’s a lot less of it now, but it’s only going to start building back up again. I’m more than well aware of this fact.\n\n\n “The troubling part is that the rate at which the cup fills is faster than the rate at which it grows bigger. So, you probably don’t have any more than a year before it fills up again, I think.”\n\n\n Since Freida has the same devouring I do, I know that she’s telling the truth, and I nod my understanding. Freida makes a visible effort to put all the emotion from her face, and speaks with forced indifference.\n\n\n “So, Maine. You need to choose. Will you enslave yourself to a nobleman, or live with your family until you rot away?”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n I blink in disbelief, and a troubled smile flickers across Freida’s face.\n\n\n “Magic tools are, fundamentally, the possessions of noble families. My grandfather knew about my devouring and spent a lot of money to buy nearly-broken magical tools that the nobility consider worthless, so my family now has a few, but I think that even if you were to look very hard, there wouldn’t be any more out there.”\n\n\n “Whaaaaaat?! A broken, worthless thing is two small gold and two large silver?!”\n\n\n My eyes go completely wide with shock. Freida stares at me for a moment, blinking a few times, then slowly tilts her head to the side.\n\n\n “That’s a small price to pay for your own life, is it not? A properly-functioning magic tool is something you buy with large gold coins. If a commoner with the devouring wants to live, they need to make a contract with a nobleman to work solely for their sake, buy the tool, and then work for the rest of their lives to pay off that debt.”\n\n\n Freida looks at me like this is the most obvious thing in the world as she explains it to me, and I realize that this must be an explanation that she herself has been told many, many times.\n\n\n “…Freida, does that mean that you…”\n\n\n When I ask her if she’s also going to enter in a contract with a nobleman to buy a magic tool, she suddenly smiles brightly, like a flower blooming.\n\n\n “That’s right,” she says, nodding. “I’ve already made a contract with a nobleman. He’ll let me continue living here until I’m 15, when I’m an adult. Then, when my coming-of-age ceremony is complete, we’ve agreed that I’ll become his concubine.”\n\n\n “What?! H, h-hi-his, concubine?! Do you know what that word you’re saying means?!”\n\n\n I cannot possibly believe that a word like that could have come out of the mouth of a sweet, adorable little girl like Freida. My mouth flaps open and closed, speechless, but Freida, strangely, looks at me in astonishment.\n\n\n “…From that reaction, Maine, you know what a concubine is?” “I mean, a concubine… a concubine…”\n\n\n This is not a word that a six- or seven-year old child should know. On top of that, not only does she know what it means, she is perfectly okay with knowing that she’ll become one. This can’t be happening.\n\n\n “There was talk about being his second or third wife, but they said that if I were to be his official wife then things like the line of succession and the order of precedence amongst his other wives would become quite complicated. In particular, since our family has more money than many lower-ranked noble families, the chances are quite high that me marrying a nobleman might cause quite a lot of unnecessary strife. That’s what my grandfather told me.”\n\n\n “Eeeeeeek?! Guild leader!” I unintentionally shout out loud. “What are you saying around kids?!”\n\n\n Freida’s facial expression hardens, and she looks at me sternly.\n\n\n “Maine, don’t think that this is not your problem too. If you choose to live, then you will have to live in the world of the nobility. Unless you’re skilled at social maneuvering, even if you gain a magic tool there are still many other reasons you could be killed. Information is key if you want to protect yourself. If he’d hidden that from me, I would have been in danger, you know?”\n\n\n “I’m sorry. I wasn’t thinking.”\n\n\n As usual, I’d let my stupidly peaceful Japanese thought process slip, and it seems like she didn’t miss it at all. This is not the lukewarm world I had so peacefully lived in.\n\n\n Freida smiles wryly at me as I apologize.\n\n\n “Don’t worry about it. My particular case is rather unusual. My grandfather is the guild leader, and very many members of the nobility do business with him, you know? There are those who wish to develop closer ties to my family, and there are those who seek our help, so we were able to select conditions that were the most favorable to both myself and my family.”\n\n\n “When you say conditions, you mean…?”\n\n\n Somehow swept along, I tilt my head curiously to the side and ask my question. Freida gives me a look that seems to praise me for actually following along, then opens her mouth to reply.\n\n\n “I’ll be able to get a shop in the nobles’ quarter. This won’t just be me being given the first floor of my patron’s residence or a detached room on the property, I’d get my very own shop. The startup fees and living expenses would be provided by my family, but this will be the same thing as establishing a branch of our store in the nobles’ quarter directly. We’ll be able to start up the kind of trade we had to abandon due to the devouring. I’m really looking forward to it!”\n\n\n Freida smiles brightly, her eyes glittering. Her entire posture conveys just how much she’s looking forward to her gleaming future. I, however, am confused.\n\n\n “I… see. Have you thought at all about marrying someone you love, instead?”\n\n\n “Now, Maine, what are you talking about? No matter what kind of life you live, marriage is decided by your father, is it not? There are cases where you might pick between a few suiters, but it’s always the case that the man you marry will be decided for you.”\n\n\n “Ah… you’re right.”\n\n\n Argh, my common sense is really a lack of common sense in this world. Now that she mentions it, one’s spouse really is decided by one’s father. It’s a relationship between two families.\n\n\n “So, my family will be able to establish a permanent location in the nobles’ quarter, and even though my patron will take thirty percent of my sales I’ll be owning my own shop, and since I’ll have some physical distance between myself and my patron I’ll be able to escape the more troubling things, so I think these are quite favorable conditions for me.”\n\n\n Watching Freida talk about becoming a concubine while wearing such a dazzlingly cute smile, I am once again reminded of just how much my own intuition differs from that of this world. My feelings right now are complex.\n\n\n “Although, Maine,” she continues, “you don’t seem to have anything to offer a nobleman, do you? I thought you’d be quite envious of my situation when I told you about me becoming a concubine. Think about it, Maine, and try to live a life that you won’t come to regret.”\n\n\n Ahh, I see. Since I have the devouring as well, if I want to live, I’ll need to find the patronage of a nobleman, too. So, what she’s telling me is that before the next time I’m overwhelmed by the devouring I should think about what I plan to do with myself in the future.\n\n\n Do I plan on forever indebting myself to a nobleman, or do I die surrounded by my family?\n\n\n “Thanks, Freida. I’ll think about what I should do. I’m glad you told me all of this.”\n\n\n “Certainly; you don’t have anyone else in your life that could tell you of these things, correct? If you’re ever worried about the devouring, please come talk to me. We’re the only ones who can really understand each other about what’s happening to us.”\n\n\n Since the devouring is such a rare disease, it’s similarly rare to find someone who knows about it. It’s extremely reassuring to know that there’s someone I can talk to about it.\n\n\n “I’m grateful for the offer, thank you,” I reply. “I should probably go home now.”\n\n\n I’ve realized that the room is gradually growing darker and darker. The sun will probably be setting soon, I think. I need to return home as soon as I can, or my family will be worried about me. Since our conversation is finished, I move to get down from the bed, but Freida pushes me back down.\n\n\n “It’s okay, your family already knows you’re here. Please keep resting.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n “They were here again earlier today.”\n\n\n “Again…? How long was I unconscious?”\n\n\n I was not expecting it to be a totally different day. As my eyes go wide, Freida puts a hand to her cheek, tilting her head thoughtfully to the side.\n\n\n “You were carried here shortly before lunch yesterday, and today the sun is already setting. It seems that you’re still very exhausted, and it seems like it took you a very long time to wake up even after your fever went down. Even though your fever’s already gone down, it’s been decided that you’ll stay here, just to make sure you’re okay, until after the baptismal ceremony the day after tomorrow.”\n\n\n It looks like a lot of things happened without me knowing about them. Even just thinking about what my family must have felt when they were told what happened to me makes my stomach ache.\n\n\n “Lutz, I believe, will be coming here tomorrow morning, and I think your family might come along too. So it is okay to close your eyes again and rest for now, Maine.”\n\n\n “Thanks, Freida.”\n\n\n “Before you talk with your family tomorrow, please think hard about your own opinions. …Now, tomorrow, if you’re feeling up for it, how about we make sweets together, like we promised?”\n\n\n Freida stands up, her chair clattering behind her, and picks up her candle, then quietly walks away out of my field of view. I start to ruminate about what she’d told me, my thoughts going between various possibilities, but my body still craves more rest, so even though I’m still sitting up my eyelids start to droop. I squirm my way back under the covers, unable to resist the snug comfort of this bed, and I go out light a light.\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. “Futon” here refers to the Japanese-style futon, which is a quilted mattress filled with batting, unlike Western futons, which are generally fold-out couches filled with foam."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The next morning, I leave the bed for the first time and get a look at the rest of the room.\n\n\n Whoooa, it’s like a hotel.\n\n\n The room is over four meters long on each side. In one corner sits the canopy bed, but there’s also a round table, three chairs, and a fireplace. In addition to the simple furnishings, though, the floor is covered in a thick carpet and curtains are swaying in a window whose glass has a rippling, undulating design, as if to stop people outside from looking in. It may be a simple room, but it is very obviously one that a lot of money was spent on.\n\n\n Also, near a chair by the door, there is already a servant woman waiting for me.\n\n\n “Good morning. Please, wash your face here. When you are dressed, I will lead you to the dining room.”\n\n\n “A… alright.”\n\n\n She briskly prepares a bowl of hot water for me to wash my face in and hands me a clean cloth. I’m a little nervous at being treated so graciously.\n\n\n “Please, change into these close. This may be rude of me to say, ma'am, but it would be troublesome for you to be seen in this house in your own attire.”\n\n\n “I understand.”\n\n\n The clothes that she produces look like Freida’s old clothes. At the sight of them, however, my heart jumps for joy, seeing that they aren’t extremely worn and constantly patched together like mine are. I quickly comb out my hair as well and do it up with my hairpin. The servant looks at my hairpin curiously, but doesn’t say a thing. With that, my preparations are complete.\n\n\n I’m led to the dining room, where Freida and the guild leader are already waiting for me. I realize that I haven’t yet thanked the guild leader for helping me out.\n\n\n “Good morning, guild leader. I am very grateful for all of your assistance.”\n\n\n The guild leader nods slightly in reply. Freida quickly rushes over to me, then pats me on my forehead and the nape of my neck. I flinch when I feel her slightly cool hands on my skin, but she doesn’t seem to care.\n\n\n “Good morning, Maine! It looks like your fever’s gone totally away, doesn’t it?”\n\n\n “Good morning, Freida. I doing great! I’m feeling very refreshed.”\n\n\n Ah, was she feeling my temperature? Now that I actually understand the reason behind her sudden action, I give her a cheerful smile. She smiles happily back at me, and we both turn towards the dining table.\n\n\n The guild leader harrumphs. “It’s good to see that you’re doing well, but this is all the help you’re going to get with the magic tools. I bought these so that they’d be ready if something happens to Frieda, after all.”\n\n\n “Grandpa!” objects Freida.\n\n\n “It’s just like he says, Freida,” I say to her. “They’re things he collected for your sake.” I turn to the guild leader. “Sir, I am deeply grateful that you sold me such a valuable magic tool. Thank you.”\n\n\n It was an extremely precious thing that he’d had to use his connections and money to their maximum extent to acquire. Even though I’ll be paying him back financially, it was amazingly good fortune that he sold it to me in the first place.\n\n\n “Maine,” he says, “think hard about what you’ll be doing after this.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir,” I reply.\n\n\n “Now then, we should send word to your family that you’re awake. I’ll send a messenger; is there anything you’d like to tell them?”\n\n\n I’m a little startled when he mentions sending a messenger, but I realize that there’s no way that the guild leader would walk to my house himself. Sending a messenger is only normal for him. He calls over a young man, who confirms with me where my house is.\n\n\n “Umm,” I say, “Could you ask them if they could bring some ‘simple shampoo and conditioner’ with them as a thank-you gift for Freida, please?”\n\n\n We still call it simple shampoo and conditioner at my house, but it really doesn’t seem to the the kind of name that you can immediately remember after hearing it just once. The messenger’s face is strained as he tries hard to remember exactly what my message is.\n\n\n “Sim-pull sham…? Um, I’m terribly sorry, but might I ask you to repeat that for me?”\n\n\n “Ummm, if you tell them to bring the liquid that makes hair shiny, I think they’ll understand. I’m sorry to have to trouble you with this, but thank you very much for your effort.”\n\n\n “Liquid to make hair shiny. I understand, ma'am.”\n\n\n As I see the messenger off, I notice that the guild leader is looking at me intently, stroking his chin. For some reason, I suddenly feel like he’d had a disturbing sort of smile on his face as he was watching me just a moment ago.\n\n\n “You certainly do have some interesting things, Maine,” he remarks.\n\n\n “That’s right, Grandpa,” says Freida. “I thought for sure we’d get her in exchange for that magic tool, but now I’m really disappointed we didn’t.”\n\n\n With neither Benno nor Lutz here, the thought of getting cornered by these two is terrifying. They’d swallow me whole in the blink of an eye.\n\n\n “The money for the magic tool!” I exclaim. “Let me pay you for that.”\n\n\n I’d be in trouble if I got overcharged for some reason or another, or if the price suddenly raised on me, so I immediately touch my guild card to the guild leader’s, completing the transaction.\n\n\n “You really did have that much… Benno,” he grumbles, vexed.\n\n\n Somehow, Benno managed to dodge his way through the net the guild leader had laid out to snare him.\n\n\n Good job, Mister Benno!\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Maine, please eat as much as you like.”\n\n\n “Don’t mind if I do!”\n\n\n It’s hard to keep my face from shining. I mean, the bread they brought out for breakfast is white bread! Real, white bread, made only with flour! On top of that, I can use as much honey as I like; isn’t this too luxurious? After stuffing my face full of sweet, delicious bread, I reach for the soup.\n\n\n The soup is pleasantly salty, but I feel like all of the savoriness of the vegetables has escaped. It seems that, as expected, once they boiled the vegetables to completion they just threw out the leftover brother. This seems to be a pretty well-established practice in the culinary arts around here. The bacon and eggs are amazingly delicious, and for dessert they bring out a selection of fruits.\n\n\n I’m deeply moved by this luxurious breakfast. It’s like something I could have gotten in Japan. The breakfasts of the rich sure are delicious. As I enthusiastically chow down, the guild leader looks at me with a frown.\n\n\n “Maine, who taught you your manners?”\n\n\n “I wasn’t really taught, I don’t think?”\n\n\n I’m not technically lying: I’d dug out books on manners and gone to family restaurants to practice them, but I was never actually formally taught manners. The guild leader, however, only frowns more deeply, looking at me with naked curiosity written all over his face. I, however, don’t pay him any mind as I finish my breakfast. If I let it bother me, I lose.\n\n\n Shortly after breakfast is finished, the guild leader heads off to work. As Freida and I rest, we’re notified that guests have arrived. It seems that my family has stopped by to see me on their way to work.\n\n\n “Maine!” says my father, leaping into the room with outstretched arms. My mother shoves him aside. “Whargh?!”\n\n\n “You’re awake!” she says. “I’m so glad. When Lutz told me that you’d collapsed in Mister Benno’s store and had to be carried to Miss Freida’s home, I thought my heart was going to stop.”\n\n\n “I’m sorry to make you worry,” I reply. “Freida has the same sickness I do, so she knows a lot of things about it that I didn’t.”\n\n\n There is no way I could tell her outright that I just spent two small gold and eight large silver coins to use a magic tool. She’s faint on the spot.\n\n\n “Miss Freida,” she says, “thank you so very much.”\n\n\n “Mommy,” I say, “did you bring the 'simple shampoo and conditioner’ to thank Freida with?”\n\n\n I couldn’t really think of anything else to thank her with besides money, but since her baptismal ceremony is tomorrow, I think this is excellent timing for making her hair sparklingly clean.\n\n\n “We did. I don’t know whether or not something like this is a good thank-you, though. Tory?”\n\n\n “Thank you for helping Maine, Miss Freida,” says Tory, handing Freida a small jar.\n\n\n Freida takes it with a smile, bending slightly at the waste. “You are very welcome.”\n\n\n “We really are very grateful,” says my father. “Lutz told us that Maine was in a very serious condition. Thank you very much for saving my daughter.” He turns to me. “Maine, you seem to be doing better; will you come home today?”\n\n\n His eyes convey that he wants me to return home immediately. Since my family is already worried, I personally want to return home as soon as it looks like I can, but Freida stands in my way, smiling.\n\n\n “No, as we discussed earlier, Maine will be staying here until the day of the baptismal ceremonies so that we can keep an eye on her condition. I would be deeply troubled if she suddenly got worse.”\n\n\n “…Ah, right,” says my father reluctantly.\n\n\n “We’re sorry for the trouble,” says my mother, turning to face Freida and bending slightly at the waist, “but please take care of Maine.”\n\n\n As I wonder if this is some sort of greeting, I lean a little bit closer to get a better look, but Tory reaches out with both hands and grabs me firmly by the cheeks.\n\n\n “We’re going to work now. Make sure you don’t act up like you usually do, okay?”\n\n\n “Alright, Tory. Come pick me up on baptism day! Good luck at work!”\n\n\n My family rushes out, looking like they’re in a bit of a hurry, passing Lutz, who is just arriving, on their way out.\n\n\n “You’re awake! How’s your fever? Has it really gone down?”\n\n\n Just like Freida had done this morning, Lutz pats my forehead and the nape of my neck, checking my temperature. Since he just came in from outside, though, his hands are freezing cold compared to Freida’s, and I let out a yelp.\n\n\n “Wait, Lutz! Your hands are cold!”\n\n\n “Oops, sorry.”\n\n\n “Sorry I made you worry. I’m okay now, though.”\n\n\n “…You’ll be okay for about a year, right?”\n\n\n Lutz’s lips are pursed, silently saying that we can’t celebrate just yet. However, the fact that we put this off another year is itself momentous.\n\n\n “Yeah. …I’ll use that time to think about a lot of things, and try looking to see if there really isn’t something we can do about it. First off, I have to make a book.”\n\n\n “That’s all you ever think about! Well, I’m going to go tell Master Benno that you’re awake. He said yesterday that he’d come to check in on you later this afternoon.”\n\n\n When Benno’s name comes up, Freida suddenly scowls. She’d taken a step back at some point, but now that she’s heard that she steps forward to muscle her way in.\n\n\n “Oh dear, this afternoon would be a problem. Maine and I promised each other that we’d spend the afternoon making sweets! Isn’t that right, Maine?”\n\n\n Somehow, I get the feeling that it wouldn’t be that good an idea to let Benno and Freida meet. I can’t help but get an awful premonition that I’d wind up awkwardly sitting between the two of them as they glare at each other, caught between a rock and a hard place.\n\n\n “So, Lutz, I’m sorry, but if you say you’re going to Mister Benno’s shop, could you tell him that as well?”\n\n\n “Yeah, sure… but what are you making? Something new?”\n\n\n Lutz, of course, finds the talk of my promise to make sweets with Freida far more interesting than whatever he has to do with Benno.\n\n\n I shake my head, chuckling. “I can’t decide on what we’re making until I’ve talked with the person who does the cooking here.”\n\n\n “Oh my,” says Freida, “you haven’t decided yet?”\n\n\n Until I know what kinds of ingredients and tools I can use, I can’t really come up with any solid ideas about what we’ll make. Also, if the cook is a cooperative sort of person, we’d be able to make something that might take a while to do so. If they’re only just putting up with us, though, I’d prefer to make something a little simpler.\n\n\n “I have no idea what kinds of ingredients or tools we can use, so I can’t decide yet.”\n\n\n “You could make things with Lutz, though, right?”\n\n\n Freida purses her lips, looking as if she doesn’t understand my explanation. Since Lutz’s lifestyle is similar to mine, the tools and ingredients that he has at his house aren’t going to be vastly different from those at mine, but since Freida’s house is so vastly different, I can’t really even compare the two of them together at all.\n\n\n “I only really tell people how to cook. At Lutz’s house, I use his family’s ingredients, and he and his brothers help out a lot. Right, Lutz?”\n\n\n “Yeah, since you don’t have any strength, and you don’t have any endurance, and you still haven’t grown up.”\n\n\n “I think we’ll be done this evening, so I think we can save a bit for you to sample, you know?”\n\n\n “Seriously?! I’m looking forward to it!”\n\n\n Freida seems to be burning with some sort of sense of rivalry with Lutz, and after she scowlingly watches him walk out the door, she turns to me, cheeks puffed out in the most adorable sulk.\n\n\n “You’re too nice to him.”\n\n\n “Oh, no, not at all. It’s the opposite. He’s way too nice to me.”\n\n\n At those words, Freida only sulks even harder. To be honest, I have absolutely no idea why she might possibly be doing this.\n\n\n Freida suddenly points directly at my face. “Alright! Then I’m going to be way too nice to you too!”\n\n\n “Huh? Why?”\n\n\n “Well, you’re my number one best friend, but I’m not your number one best friend, and that’s not okay!”\n\n\n What an adorable creature. I want to mush up her little cheeks.\n\n\n “Well, would it make you feel better if we did all the girls-only things I can’t do with Lutz, then?”\n\n\n “Girls-only things?”\n\n\n I start thinking about all the things I enjoy chattering with Tory while doing. Freida’s hobby is money. Playing with dolls like a normal girl is probably outside her norm. That might still be fun, but apart from that, there’s not whole lot of things we could do to spend time playing.\n\n\n “Like, taking baths together and wash each other’s hair, or just lazing around on the bed and chatting about things, you know, things only girls can do with each other?”\n\n\n “Why, that sounds wonderful! Well, to start, let’s go see the cook about making this sweets, okay?”\n\n\n Freida grabs my hand and pulls me along towards the kitchen. There, I see a slightly chubby older woman who looks to have just finished tidying up after breakfast. She looks to be around the same age as my mother, and her demeanor seems to be much like Lutz’s mother, Auntie Carla’s.\n\n\n “Ilse, Ilse,” says Freida. “About the sweets we’re going to be making today…”\n\n\n “Yes, yes, young lady,” she replies. “You’re going to make them with your friend? You’ve told me about this very many times by now.”\n\n\n “What kind of ingredients might we be able to use?” I ask.\n\n\n Ilse’s raises her eyebrows the tiniest bit. “When you say ingredients, just what are you planning to use?”\n\n\n “Ummm, basically, flour, butter, sugar, and eggs. We don’t have sugar at my house, so we use jam or honey, but if I might ask, do you have any here?”\n\n\n Depending on your tools and ingredients, there’s a huge difference in the kinds of sweets that you can make. There’s a very good reason behind the fact that all I’ve been able to make at Lutz’s house has been pancakes and french toast.\n\n\n “Yes, we have sugar.”\n\n\n “Really?! Amazing! Um, uh, then, do you have an oven?”\n\n\n “We do. Do you see it over there?”\n\n\n Ilse shifts slightly to one side, and I can see a large wood-fired oven behind her. My heart quickly fills with ever-increasing expectation. I clasp my hands tightly together in front of my chest, looking eagerly up at Ilse.\n\n\n “Since you’ve got an oven, you’ve got pots and pans that you can use in an oven, right?”\n\n\n “Of course we do.”\n\n\n “And scales?”\n\n\n “That’s right.”\n\n\n Ilse shrugs her shoulders as if I’m asking the most obvious things in the world; I, however, jump for joy.\n\n\n “Woohoo! We can bake a 'cake’!”\n\n\n Recipe after recipe bubbles up through my brain. Of course, these are recipes that I know the various ingredient quantities for.\n\n\n Huh? But… even though I remember the recipes, I don’t actually know how to translate grams into this world’s units of weight. What do I do now?2\n\n\n Since I’ve been focusing so hard on the thought of making sweets, this completely slipped my mind, but you need more than just ingredients and tools to make sweets. If you don’t get the amounts of each ingredient just right, it’ll end up a failure.\n\n\n When I was making parucakes at Lutz’s house, I did it all by intuition, which meant that the puffiness and thickness varied every time. Since my audience was boys who didn’t actually care about anything except quantity, I managed to pull it off, but if I want to make something in earnest, I need precise measurements.\n\n\n Isn’t there anything I can do? Some sort of sweet that I can make without being able to measure things in grams…\n\n\n I try to recall any recipes that I can make without knowing the measurements, and come up with something that fits exactly from a book I read on French cuisine.\n\n\n “Ummm, I think we should make a kind of sweet called a 'pound cake’.”\n\n\n Pound cake, or quatre-quarts in French, is a cake made with equal quantities of flour, eggs, butter, and sugar. If we make pound cake, then it doesn’t actually matter what the actual weight of the ingredients are. All we have to do is measure the same amount on the scale.\n\n\n “I haven’t heard of it,” says Ilse. “What kind of sweet is that?”\n\n\n “It’s a sweet that you put equal amounts of flour, eggs, butter, and sugar into.”\n\n\n “You really want to make something like that?”\n\n\n Ilse looks at me with startled eyes. I flinch a little bit, then walk back my previous remarks.\n\n\n “…If that’s not okay then we can make something else?”\n\n\n “It’s not that it’s not okay, but do you really know how to make something like that?”\n\n\n “Yes!”\n\n\n I get her to promise to make sure the oven is ready by the time we’re ready to make sweets, and then Freida and I withdraw from the kitchen. After that, we start looking for some aprons for the two of us. Freida, who has never helped around the house in her life, seems to have never worn an apron before. One of the female servants digs some out and offers them to us, asking if they’re what we’re looking for. We put them on, and then cover our hair with large handkerchiefs folded into triangles.\n\n\n When the time we promised to start cooking comes around, we head to the kitchen, where Ilse is there. She looks down at us, a mirthful twinkle in her eye.\n\n\n “Oh my, young lady,” she says to Freida. “You look quite fired up!”\n\n\n “That’s right. I will be helping make it as well!”\n\n\n Unfortunately, we don’t have a cake pan, so instead we find a small iron pot to use instead. Then, we get to work.\n\n\n “So, how about you start by explaining how to make this?” asks Ilse. “If I don’t understand the process from start to finish I won’t be able to make it.”\n\n\n “Of course,” I reply. “First, we need to measure out the ingredients. Then, we need to warm the eggs up to about body temperature and then whip them together with the sugar.”\n\n\n “How should we warm up the eggs?”\n\n\n “Umm, we could fill up a bigger bowl with hot water and put the bowl with the eggs in there.”\n\n\n “Ah, a water bath. Then, before we measure the ingredients, we need to heat up the water first.”\n\n\n Unlike with a gas stove, we can’t actually boil water immediately. This is really obvious, but since I haven’t seriously made a cake before, there are absolutely going to be trivial details that I just won’t notice.\n\n\n “Whipping the eggs and sugar together is the most important part. Once they’re whipped until they stand, then we slowly cut in sifted flour. Then, we add melted butter, but very carefully to avoid ruining the eggs.”\n\n\n “We’ll need to melt the butter too. Once everything’s mixed, then we bake it?”\n\n\n “That’s right.”\n\n\n Ilse, who seems to have understood the directions, takes out a scale and places it on the prep counter. Then, she starts giving us directions on how to measure out the ingredients, which have already been lined up for me. While Freida instructs us on the use of the scale, Freida and I measure out equal quantities of each ingredient. Meanwhile, Ilse starts heating up the water.\n\n\n First, we measure out the eggs and the sugar, then warm them up in the hot water. When they get up to body temperature, Ilse devotes herself to whipping them together. How frothy they are will have a big difference on the cake’s fluffiness and flavor. As she does this, Freida and I measure out the flour and butter.\n\n\n “This should be perfect,” says Ilse.\n\n\n “Let’s coat the inside of the pan with butter now.”\n\n\n “Why?”\n\n\n “It’s so that we can make sure it’s easy to take the cake out of the pan.”\n\n\n We smear butter all around the inside of the pot, then lightly dust it with flour. Since we have neither a cake pan nor anything to use as parchment paper, we don’t have a choice.\n\n\n “Next, should we sift the flour?”\n\n\n We start sifting the flour, taking care not to send it flying everywhere. We sift it three times in total, since it’s really important that it be full of air.\n\n\n “Oh my,” says Freida, “the eggs were yellow, but now they’re white, and they’ve grown quite a bit in size.”\n\n\n As Ilse whips the eggs, her whisk clattering against the bowl, Freida looks at her with some sort of envy. It’s really obvious that she wants to help with the whipping, so Ilse laughingly offers the bowl and the whisk to her.\n\n\n “Want to try?”\n\n\n “I do!”\n\n\n She happily starts whipping the eggs, but very quickly hands the bowl back. Without a hand mixer, making a cake is a very strenuous process.\n\n\n “How does this look?” asks Ilse, showing me the bowl of whipped eggs and sugar.\n\n\n “Perfect! Now we add the flour.”\n\n\n We set the sifter once again on top of the bowl and slowly add the flour. Using a wooden spatula, I cut the flour into the eggs and sugar.\n\n\n “We’ll mix it like this. Next will be the butter. Is it melting?”\n\n\n “That’s right,” says Ilse, “after we warmed up the water I put the butter next to the stove.”\n\n\n “Miss Ilse, please switch with me. My arms are really tired…”\n\n\n “Good grief,” she laughs. “Neither of you two young ladies has any strength.”\n\n\n Smiling, she switches with me. We add the butter to the dough in much the same way, then mix it together. Freida brings the pot we’re using as our cake pan over, then looks on with gleaming eyes.\n\n\n “While we’re pouring it in, we need to hit the pan like this so that we don’t have any bubbles.”\n\n\n Since the pot is so heavy, I leave it to Ilse. Ever since the start of this process it seems that she didn’t think Freida and I could actually do this, so she helpfully follows along with my instructions.\n\n\n “Now, once it bakes in the oven, it’ll be all finished.”\n\n\n Since I don’t really know how to use a wood-fired oven, I think leaving that to Ilse is the best idea. When she opens the oven, a blast of heat roars out. She quickly puts the cake batter inside, then closes the door with a clank.\n\n\n “I think it’ll be done by the time we finish cleaning up,” I say.\n\n\n We try to help Ilse out as she briskly moves through the kitchen, tidying things up, but wind up caught halfway between help and hindrance. Freida, who can’t stop expectantly fidgeting, looks very cute.\n\n\n “Is it done yet, I wonder?”\n\n\n “Not yet,” I reply.\n\n\n Ah, now that I think about it, there aren’t any bamboo skewers in this world, are there? How the heck am I going to check to see if it’s done?\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. The room is described as bigger than an 8-tatami mat room, which is approximately 3.6m square. I’ve rounded up to preserve the feel of the estimate.\n\n\n 2. Recipes in Japan (actually, outside the US) are generally measured in terms of weight and not volume, so instead of a recipe calling for a cup of flour it would call for 120 grams."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n I nervously watch the oven, wondering if this really is going to turn out alright. This pound cake is a dessert that uses liberal amounts of some very precious ingredients. Not only am I in someone else’s house using someone else’s ingredients, but this is also the very first sweet I’m making for Freida. I cannot mess up.\n\n\n “Maine, is it done yet?”\n\n\n “How about we take a look?”\n\n\n Ilse cracks open the oven, and I peer inside. I can see that it’s puffing up quite nicely, but the back part of the cake seems to have browned more than the front.\n\n\n “Miss Ilse, it looks like the back part is pretty well baked, so could you please turn it around?”\n\n\n “Sure,” she replies.\n\n\n She pushes the cake pan around in the oven, rotating it. Even if I were wearing the same sort of thick mittens she is, I definitely wouldn’t want to stick my hands into that blazing oven. I’m impressed by the kinds of things professional cooks get used to.\n\n\n Ilse shuts the oven door with a clack, then looks down at me. “How do you tell when it’s done baking?” she asks.\n\n\n “Ummm, I’d usually check on it by sticking in something like a bamboo skewer; do you have any sort of long, thin rod with a pointy tip?”\n\n\n “Hmm, the first thing that comes to mind is the skewers we use for grilling meat.”\n\n\n After rummaging about for a little bit, she produces iron skewers, like you might stick vegetables or meat on at a barbecue. I’ve never seen anyone use iron skewers to check cake before, but, honestly, the only way to find out whether or not it’ll work is to try it.\n\n\n …These are going to leave behind some pretty big holes, but since I don’t have any bamboo skewers, I don’t have much of a choice, do I?\n\n\n In the past, when I didn’t have any bamboo skewers I used a cooking chopstick, so I think it’ll probably be okay. Ilse quickly sticks the skewer into the cake. When she pulls it out and shows it to me, I can see that a bit of uncooked batter still clings to the rod.\n\n\n “It looks like the inside’s not cooked yet.”\n\n\n “How can you tell that?”\n\n\n “See how some batter’s stuck to the skewer? When it comes out totally clean, that’s the sign it’s done.”\n\n\n By the time the inside is fully cooked through, the top of the cake is starting to turn a fairly dark brown. I think the oven might be a little too hot. However, unlike the ovens I’ve used before, it’s not easy to precisely control the actual temperature, so all I can do is entrust this to the experience of this trained worker.\n\n\n “Hmm, I’ll need to watch the oven more closely next time,” murmurs Ilse.\n\n\n She pulls the pound cake out of the oven. Once it’s removed from its pan, it’s revealed to be a fluffy, round, almost sponge cake-like cake.\n\n\n “Amazing!” exclaims Freida.\n\n\n “Yeah,” says Ilse, “this looks quite delicious.”\n\n\n As the two of them look at the finished pound cake with glittering eyes, an indescribable feeling of accomplishment wells up in my chest.\n\n\n “It’ll be really delicious if we cover it with a firmly wrung-out wet cloth so it doesn’t dry out and then just let it sit for a couple of days, but how about we taste just a little bit right now?”\n\n\n I ask Ilse to cut out a very slender slice from it, which I pick up with my fingertips and bring it to my mouth. Eating without a fork like this, before anyone else has been drawn to the kitchen by the smell, is the epitome of the kind of tasting that only those who make the dish can truly appreciate.\n\n\n “Yeah, this tastes perfect.”\n\n\n I’ve only ever eaten this when it’s in actual pound-cake shape, but even though it’s just a circle, and even if the cake pan was an iron saucepan, the taste is all right. Ilse, accustomed to tasting things, takes the next little slice and pops it into her mouth.\n\n\n “Huh, this is…”\n\n\n Freida had been hesitating a little bit to pick up her own piece, but once she sees Ilse taste it, she hurriedly puts it in her mouth.\n\n\n “Well now!”\n\n\n Their eyes go wide when they taste it, then their heads swivel around to look directly at me. Their expressions look almost predatory, like the guild leader’s did this morning.\n\n\n …What’s up with this… kinda creepy atmosphere?\n\n\n It would probably be best if I escape from here before I get asked any awkward questions. I grab onto Freida’s hand.\n\n\n “Okay then, Freida! Let’s bring this out as a dessert after a meal so that everyone can eat it too. Let’s go take a bath next!”\n\n\n As we exit the kitchen, I look back over my shoulder, remembering my manners.\n\n\n “Thank you very much, Miss Ilse!”\n\n\n The two of us didn’t do very much real work when we were making sweets, but thanks to all of the sifting we did, the cuffs of our sleeves are stained with flour. Since we have more than plenty of time, let’s go use the rinsham and get pretty.\n\n\n When we exit the kitchen, the female servant who had helped me out earlier this morning is waiting for us.\n\n\n “You two, before you two go running about, would you kindly take baths?”\n\n\n “Well now, Yutte,” says Freida, “you’re saying exactly the same thing Maine is.”\n\n\n Freida chuckles to herself as we walk. Yutte seems to have anticipated that making sweets would get us dirty and has already prepared baths for us. With a basket in hand containing changes of clothes, towels, and the jar full of rinsham, she guides us forward.\n\n\n “This way, please.”\n\n\n She starts descending the staircase in the center of the house, but I just watch warily. At Benno’s shop, the staircase in his inner office has a staircase like this one, so I know that it wouldn’t be unusual for there to be a staircase leading down into the shop inside a merchant’s home. Is it okay for me to walk down there, though? I quietly lean over to ask Freida.\n\n\n “…Doesn’t this staircase go down to the shop?”\n\n\n “It’s okay,” she replies.\n\n\n Yutte passes the door that leads to the shop on the first floor, then goes down another flight of stairs. It seems we’re going to some sort of basement room. At the bottom of these stairs are two doors, one very sturdy and splendid, and the other ordinary.\n\n\n Yutte opens the splendid door, ushering us inside. The floor underneath my feet is warm enough that I want to say that it’s got some kind of heating, and the room temperature is fairly high as well. There are two large tables here, covered with cloth, looking entirely like massage tables. (Later, I learn that I’m not at all wrong to think this.)\n\n\n “Now then, please remove your shoes and clothing.”\n\n\n It seems like this is a combination massage parlor and changing room. Prompted by Yutte, I strip out of the clothes I’m wearing. Freida disrobes as well, with the help of Yutte.\n\n\n Then, Yutte opens another door, revealing a bathroom that’s about three by three-and-a-half meters in size.1 At the far wall sits an enormous bathtub, as big as a family-sized pool you’d see at a hot spring in Japan, able to comfortably hold two or three people. The wide floor is made out of something that looks at first glance to be white marble, as is the tub, which is filled with gently lapping hot water. Next to the tub is a statue of a young girl holding a pot, and from that pot pours a trickle of hot water. Matching the flow from the statue, a little bit of water runs out of the tub and, heated by that water, the rest of the room is quite warm. The ceiling is tiled, and the windows near the ceiling overflow with brilliant light. Thanks to the room being surrounded by gleaming white marble, the room gives off a very bright atmosphere.\n\n\n “Whaaat?! What is this?!”\n\n\n Taken aback by the utterly unexpected appearance of such a grandiose bath, I unintentionally yell out. My voice rings off of the smooth walls. Freida, seeing as how I’m frozen in place, staring through the opened door, chuckles mirthfully, walking past me into the bathroom.\n\n\n “Heh heh heh, are you surprised? This is a reproduction my grandfather had made of the baths found in the houses of the nobility! It’s not something that we use very often, but since tomorrow is my baptismal ceremony, he gave me special permission to use it.”\n\n\n “So, baths… do exist…”\n\n\n After more than a year without taking a bath, there’s now one right before my eyes. On top of that, it’s way bigger and more extravagant than Urano’s was.\n\n\n “They originally came from another country, and the nobles believe they they are good for your beauty and bodily health. Oh, just, please be careful, the ground is slippery.”\n\n\n Yutte, still clothed, follows us into the room. Only her apron has changed. It’s made of a tough material that looks like it was picked under the assumption that it would get wet, and the skirt portion of it covers her entire lower body. The skirt is rolled up a bit so that it won’t get wet, and part of it has been tied off.\n\n\n Upon entering, she immediately starts washing Freida’s hair, prompting me to hurriedly bring out the rinsham.\n\n\n “Miss Yutte, when you wash her hair, please use this. You, um, pour it on like this…”\n\n\n I try to explain to her how to use it, but her expression grows slightly troubled and she looks down at Freida.\n\n\n “Yutte,” says Freida, “would it be okay for Maine to wash my hair today?”\n\n\n “Oh, ummm,” I say, “yes, is that alright?”\n\n\n Yutte surrenders her spot to me, and I start to wash Freida’s hair. Meanwhile, she rubs a wet towel against a bar of soap and starts scrubbing Freida’s body.\n\n\n “When you have a place like this to bath someone in and can use a lot of hot water, you can put the rinsham directly in your hands like this and then apply it to their hair. You need to be careful to use your fingertips when you’re washing their scalp so that you don’t poke them with your nails.”\n\n\n “It’s kinda ticklish,” says Freida, “but it feels nice.”\n\n\n Freida’s hair is most likely already being maintained by Yutte, I think. It was already smooth before I started, and glossy, too. There might not have been a need to use the rinsham to begin with.\n\n\n Since there’s a high chance that rich people have already established their own styles of cosmetology, I wonder if it might actually be kind of hard to sell rinsham?\n\n\n I think about things like that as I continue washing Freida’s hair. I wonder if I should inform Benno about this.\n\n\n “Once you’ve washed all of the hair like this, then you rinse it out. Please take extra care to make sure all of it gets rinsed off of the scalp.”\n\n\n As I say that, Yutte pours a bucketful of water over Freida. When her entire body except for her head has been rinsed off, she quickly walks over to the bathtub and hops in. I stare blankly, wondering what in the world she’s doing getting into the tub with shampoo still in her hair2, but she rests her head on the edge of the tub, letting her hair hang down. Then, Yutte starts carefully rinsing off the hair that dangles out of the tub.\n\n\n Oh ho, is that how you wash someone’s head? I’m glad I didn’t immediately say “oh, I’ll rinse you off” and dump a bucket of water on her. That would have been pretty awkward.\n\n\n In the brief time it takes for me to marvel, wide-eyed, at how rich girls take their baths, Yutte finishes rinsing Freida’s hair off. Truly, an environment where you can just splash water everywhere is magnificent.\n\n\n Now that Freida’s all clean, I reach out for the jar of rinsham so that I can wash my own hair. With a splash, Freida jumps out of the tub and runs up to me, looking at me with brilliant eyes.\n\n\n “I want to try washing your hair, too!”\n\n\n “…I can do it myself, though?”\n\n\n Is it okay for a rich little girl to do something like that?\n\n\n I quickly glance over at Yutte, silently asking if this is a proper thing to do. She sighs lightly, then comes over to sit down next to me too.\n\n\n “Well then, young lady, how about you help me? I’d like to practice how to use this ‘rinsham’ as well.”\n\n\n “Excellent!”\n\n\n She says she wants practice, but I’m pretty sure she’s really there to fix up any mistakes that Freida might make. Thank you, Yutte.\n\n\n The two of them wash my hair, big fingertips and little fingertips squirming against my scalp. It’s almost painfully ticklish, but I manage to bear my way through it without bursting into laughter.\n\n\n “Maine, your hair is so silky smooth,” says Freida.\n\n\n “It’s naturally very straight,” I say, “so it’s really hard to tie it back with a string since it just keeps slipping out. All I can really use to keep it up is my hairpin.”\n\n\n “It’s a mystery to me how a wooden stick like that can keep hair in place.”\n\n\n “Hmmm, well, it was kind of a last resort, since I couldn’t find anything else nearby that would work…”\n\n\n When Yutte feels my hair is appropriately washed, she leaves Freida to continue working on that while she starts scrubbing my body. Since I can’t really run away while Freida’s still working on my hair, I have no choice but to sit there and let her do it.\n\n\n “There, now you’re all clean too,” says Freida.\n\n\n Freida, who has basically just been ruffling my hair for a while, seems satisfied with her handiwork and pulls back, and I reach for the bucket. However, Yutte quickly snatches it out of the way.\n\n\n “Now then,” she says, “I’ll rinse your hair out for you, so please get in the bathtub.”\n\n\n “B… but I can do it myself?”\n\n\n “You are a guest here, Maine. Please, go right ahead.”\n\n\n With a smile, she forces me forward, so I get into the tub like Freida had, resting my head on its rim. I let my hair hang down, and Yutte starts carefully rinsing it out. She pours warm water over it, gently shakes it out, and runs her hands along my scalp.\n\n\n Ahhh, it’s like a spa. This feels good…\n\n\n I wonder if Yutte always helps Freida take her baths? Her practiced motions are very comfortable; at this rate, I might just drift off again…\n\n\n “Hey, Maine,” says Freida. “How do you wash your hair when you can’t use a bathroom?”\n\n\n Freida’s question snaps me back awake in an instant. This is not a spa. I can’t fall asleep here. I look around for her, moving only my eyes, and see that she’s quietly slipped back into the tub next to me, her head resting on the side of the tub in the same pose as I’m in.\n\n\n I look up, past the steam hanging in the air, at the patterns in the tile mosaic on the ceiling, then start explaining how I usually wash my hair.\n\n\n “When you don’t have a bathroom, you’d fill a bucket like that one about halfway full of water, then mix the rinsham into that. Then, you soak your hair in the bucket, and wash it in the liquid in there. Then you wipe off your hair over and over with a cloth to make sure no liquid remains, and then you comb it all out.”\n\n\n You first dilute the rinsham to the point where it should be more-or-less okay if you can’t get it all out of your hair, then you wash it over and over, then you towel it off many, many times to make sure that there’s no rinsham left over. Even this was a last resort, developed when I really wanted to wash my hair but had no access to a bath. If my family had a bathroom, this wouldn’t have been a problem.\n\n\n “Is rinsham your thing, Maine?”\n\n\n “No, Mister Benno has all the rights to it. He should be about ready to start selling it soon.”\n\n\n “I see…”\n\n\n Freida looks like she wants to say something, but before the words can leave her mouth, Yutte stops working on my hair.\n\n\n “Should be all rinsed out by now, I think?”\n\n\n “Thank you very much,” I reply, sitting up. “That felt really good.”\n\n\n Yutte stands up smoothly. “Now then, I’ll be in the other room getting the next things ready. The two of you, please warm yourselves thoroughly.”\n\n\n “Okay~!”\n\n\n As soon as Yutte leaves the room, I slump down into the water, all the way past my shoulders. I scoop up some water, splash it over my face, and breathe deeply.\n\n\n Ahhh… paradise.\n\n\n “Maine, you look like you’re melting,” says Freida.\n\n\n “But this bath feels so good! It’s so luxurious, being able to stretch out and soak all the way up to my shoulders like this.”\n\n\n “You’re pleased with it, then?”\n\n\n “Yeah, really!” I reply, my whole face breaking out into a smile as I nod. “I want to take one every day.”\n\n\n However, I can’t see much of a smile of enjoyment on Freida’s face.\n\n\n “…Do you not like it, Freida?”\n\n\n “It’s not that I dislike it, but, it’s very hot, and when I get out my head starts spinning.”\n\n\n “Oh, you’re getting dizzy. You’re staying in too long!”\n\n\n I answer entirely by reflex, and Freida’s eyes widen.\n\n\n “Oh really? I was told to warm myself thoroughly, so I’m just staying in as long as I would in a normal bath, though?”\n\n\n “Well, in a normal bath, the water starts cooling off pretty quickly, you know? This tub, though, has that statue, which is constantly adding more hot water. So, if you stay in for the same amount of time, you’ll get dizzy, and it’ll feel bad. Why don’t we try getting out a little early today?”\n\n\n “Let’s do that.”\n\n\n Freida and I get out of the tub early. It’s quite early by my own intuition, but Freida, thoroughly warmed up, is bright pink all over.\n\n\n “Did it not feel good?” asks Yutte. “Are you okay?”\n\n\n “We’re done for today,” replies Freida.\n\n\n After we exit the bathroom, Yutte tells us that she’ll give us a massage with a perfumed oil, but I turn down the offer. I’d ordinarily be inclined to accept, but in my particular case, I won’t be taking another bath anytime soon. After I return home, I don’t know if I’ll be able to clean it all off when Tory and I are scrubbing each other. I put on my clothes, dry my hair, and then watch Freida as she gets her massage.\n\n\n “Massages… they’re so refined,” I say.\n\n\n “I don’t particularly like how long all this takes, but my grandfather says that if I’m to enter noble society, I’d better get used to this kind of thing.”\n\n\n Ahhh, I finally get it. She got in the bath even though she thinks it’s too hot and doesn’t feel very good, and she’s getting a massage even though she’s making that slightly bothered face, all to practice for when she’ll be joining noble society. I have absolutely no clue to what extent, but Freida’s life must be very different to what it used to be.\n\n\n “…Ah, I see. If you have the chance to get used to it, then you really should. There’s definitely going to be big differences in common knowledge, manners, and so on, after all.”\n\n\n “My grandfather said the same thing. That’s why he’s acquired a lot of things for this house that one might find in a nobleman’s residence.”\n\n\n Corinna’s premarital lifestyle probably wasn’t that different from what it is now. I had thought that this house felt very different than hers had, despite the fact that they’re both the houses of merchants, but it seems that the extravagance of the guild leader’s house is not just because he’s a wealthy merchant. The food, the bath, the various supplies, they’re all of vastly superior quality here, and it seems that they’re all things that the nobility have, gathered for Freida’s sake.\n\n\n “Wow, he dotes on you.”\n\n\n “…He’s investing in the future. He’s planning a lot of things ahead, making it so that I won’t run into any problems when I open my shop in the noble’s district, and so that we’ll be able to make use of the foothold we’ll finally get there.”\n\n\n Freida purses her lips, looking slightly dissatisfied. I certainly don’t think that Freida’s view is wrong, but all this is definitely not something done without any love at all.\n\n\n “It’s your dream to open a store, Freida, and isn’t he helping you out with that? When your grandfather ordered your hairpins, what I saw in him was a man who saw nothing but his granddaughter.”\n\n\n “…Oh.”\n\n\n Does Freida, perhaps, really long for other people?\n\n\n She couldn’t go outside very often while she was sick with the devouring, and when she was finally freed from that she was immediately contractually bound to a nobleman. Since it’s been decided that she’ll be that nobleman’s concubine, she’ll be living for that reason, and making friends might be very difficult in such wildly different circumstances.\n\n\n To live in noble society, she’ll need to learn to be both stubborn and calculating, and she also needs to learn everything she’ll need to know in order to manage her own shop by the time she grows up. I’m positive she spends every single day studying hard, all for her own sake, with the pressure of her very life, her future livelihood, and the expectations of her family weighing down on her. I think this must be an enormous burden for a little girl to have to bear. On top of that, although her family is spending a lot of money on her, it’s obvious that they’re operating out of their own self-interest, so she can’t just quietly sit back and depend on their care.\n\n\n Is that why she’s so attached to me?\n\n\n We both have the devouring, we’re both already involved in business despite not yet being baptized, and if Lutz is to be believed then we both let our weird hobbies run wild. We seem to be quite similar. Compared to the other kids, we have a lot in common, and there’s no denying that we get along pretty well. Is that why she wants to trap me?\n\n\n “Maine, this is amazing. My hair’s so smooth!”\n\n\n While I was spacing out, Freida finished her massage, got dressed, started running her fingers through her hair, and raised her voice in wonderment. Yutte, in the process of neatly combing it out, lifts up a lock of Freida’s hair as well.\n\n\n “Yes, it’s turned out quite well.”\n\n\n “I’m happy you like it!” I say. “I hope it’s enough of a thank-you for letting me use your magic tool?”\n\n\n “Oh my, you already paid me for that, so you don’t need to worry about that, right?”\n\n\n Smiling wryly at Freida’s very merchant-like words, I shake my head.\n\n\n “I really felt like I wanted to thank you. If the guild leader hadn’t collected all of those magic tools for your sake, then even if I had a lot of money, I wouldn’t have been able to do anything anyways.”\n\n\n “…I guess you’re right.”\n\n\n We leisurely finish up in the bathroom and head back upstairs. When we arrive, a delicious smell is once again wafting out of the kitchen. It seems Ilse is tackling her second pound cake.\n\n\n “I finally have a new recipe,” she chuckles, with a trustworthy smile, “so I have to make sure I memorize it!”\n\n\n I’m thrilled that a tasty recipe is spreading, so I can definitely support this.\n\n\n “Ilse,” says Freida, “since you’re making a new one, it’ll be okay for Maine and I to eat the one we made earlier, won’t it? I’d like to enjoy some tea with her, please make some for us.”\n\n\n “I’ll bring it out in just a bit.”\n\n\n As we move to the dining room for tea, Lutz arrives, just in time.\n\n\n “Hey, Maine! I smell something amaaazing.”\n\n\n I chuckle to myself over how sharp his nose is when it comes to smelling sweets. Lutz, though, turns to face me, narrowing his eyes and peering at me very closely.\n\n\n “What’s up, Lutz? Is something wrong?”\n\n\n “Uh, Maine. Did you kinda overdo it today? You got way too excited about your fever going down, didn’t you? Go get some sleep, like, now. You’re going to get another fever from exhaustion.”\n\n\n “Huh? Huh? You’re kidding. I feel great, you know?”\n\n\n I pat my face, tilting my head doubtfully, but Lutz only scowls and shakes his head.\n\n\n “You’re just too excited to notice it. You’re not looking so good.”\n\n\n “Oh my,” says Freida, “but her fever from the devouring has gone away, and all we’ve done today was bake sweets and take a bath, you see?”\n\n\n Freida, backing me up, lists off what we did today, her head tilted to one side. Lutz rubs frustratedly at his temples, sighing.\n\n\n “…Alright. Freida, when you don’t have the devouring, you’re a pretty healthy person. When Maine doesn’t have the devouring, she’s still really frail. Whether she collapses because of the devouring or because of exhaustion, it’s fast enough that anyone who’s not familiar with the signs won’t see it coming.”\n\n\n At those words, Freida and I spontaneously exchange a look.\n\n\n “Maine, is that true?!”\n\n\n “Freida, you’re not really weak?!”\n\n\n It seems like we’d arbitrarily decided we understood each other. Freida thought that since my devouring was gone I was perfectly fine, and I thought that the devouring had left Freida just as weak as me so I should be fine if I just kept up with what she did.\n\n\n “I don’t really know what a bath involves, but anyway, since it was your first time, and you wanted to show Freida a good time, you put in a lot of effort, right?”\n\n\n “Urgh… It wasn’t a lot of effort…”\n\n\n It’s the undeniable truth that I’ve been feeling a little pressured this entire time, on top of being convinced that if Freida was doing okay then I must be doing okay too.\n\n\n “You look like you’ve been moving around way too much today. Don’t take your own weakness too lightly. You really are weak, remember?”\n\n\n “You don’t need to keep calling me weak like that!”\n\n\n “It’s true, isn’t it? Aren’t you supposed to come home tomorrow during the baptism ceremony? If you get sick again here, your family’s going to get really mad, you know?”\n\n\n If, after getting help in curing the devouring, I run around a whole lot doing various things to try to show my thanks, then straight-up collapse with another fever as a result, I’d be throwing the favor right back in their face. My father, who’s looking forward to me getting well and coming home, would be very angry, my mother would scold me endlessly for being such an enormous bother to Freida, and Tory would just be flabbergasted. “Why can’t you just be good for once?” she’d say.\n\n\n “Aaaarnghh…”\n\n\n “He’s absolutely right,” says Freida. “You’re here under my supervision, so I can’t let you ruin your health on my behalf. Maine, please, go rest. Alright?”\n\n\n When Freida says that to me, a worried look on her face, I give the two of them a big nod.\n\n\n “Okay, I will. Thanks, Lutz, for telling me. …Freida, sorry, but, would you mind splitting that 'pound cake’ with Lutz?”\n\n\n “Yes, of course. Yutte, please help Maine get back to her room.”\n\n\n “Certainly, miss.”\n\n\n I’m led back to the guest room, and when I lie down on the bed, I’m suddenly keenly aware of how exhausted I actually am. My entire body goes limp. It seems that the slight hotness I’ve been feeling isn’t actually from having been in a bath for the first time in ages.\n\n\n That’s Lutz for you. It just took him one look…\n\n\n This was my first time in Maine’s body working under the pressure of failure while making those sweets, and my first time in an actual hot tub instead of bathing as I normally do, so I had no idea how to adjust for that, I think.\n\n\n Not only was I nervous about being in someone else’s house, but just as Lutz said, I was in way too high spirits.\n\n\n Wrapped up in the soft, comfortable bedding and the warmth of my own body, my consciousness immediately drifts away.\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. The room is described as being about the size of a 6-tatami room, which is about 2.73m x 3.64m. I’ve rounded to preserve the feel of the estimate.\n\n\n 2. When bathing in Japan, you wash and rinse yourself off completely before entering the bathtub itself. That way, the bathwater stays clean so that you and others can enjoy relaxing in it."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Translator’s note: After soliciting feedback from some people more familiar with Germanic naming conventions than I am, I’m going back and making changes to how I’m spelling certain names. Older chapters will be updated when I get time to do so.\n\n\n *Maine is now Ma?ne. Her name is supposed to be pronounced as “mine” (one syllable, like the English word), and I was basically deluding myself into believing that’s how people were pronouncing it. Maybe an umlaut will fix it.\n\n\n *Tory is now Tuuli. (A mistake I’ve regretted since chapter 5 but have been too lazy to fix.)\n\n\n *Yutte is now Jutte. The J is pronounced as a Y. It’s German.\n\n\n It’s very lively outside the bedroom door when I awake. A servant girl―not Jutte but somebody else―sits next to the door, waiting for me to wake up. She looks very youthful, probably not even twenty years old yet, and she gives off a very friendly air. When I get down off the bed and push the unexpectedly heavy canopy curtain aside, she looks over at me with a brilliant smile.\n\n\n “Good morning,” she says. “How are you feeling?”\n\n\n “It seems like my fever has gone down,” I reply, “but I can’t say that I’m fully recovered, so today I’d like to rest quietly until my family comes to pick me up.”\n\n\n She chuckles wryly.\n\n\n “There was quite a stir at dinner yesterday! When the dessert came out and the young mistress told the table that she and you had made it, the entire family wanted to meet you. They were quite excited, saying that they absolutely want you to work in our shop.”\n\n\n Wait, wait, lady, this isn’t a laughing matter, you know? Did I somehow manage to narrowly save myself from certain death by going to sleep when I did? Should I just hide away in here for the rest of the day?\n\n\n As soon as she said “your future is secure if you work at our shop”, I realized that even she was trying to get her hands on me, putting me on my guard.\n\n\n I look over at the door. “Ummm,” I say, trying to change the subject, “it really is noisy out there, isn’t it…”\n\n\n “Ahh,” she replies, her smile widening. “The young mistress has finished breakfast already and is in the middle of getting dressed. Miss Ma?ne, when you get dressed yourself, I’ll guide you to the dining room.”\n\n\n “Um, I’m really sorry to bother you like this, but might you be able to bring me my breakfast in this room? I’m still not fully recovered, so I don’t need very much, and I’m nervous about meeting people for the first time. I’ll lose my appetite, so…”\n\n\n To be honest, since I skipped dinner, I’m actually pretty hungry. However, having met Freida and the guild leader, I can guess that the rest of the family is just as diabolical. Just thinking about being surrounded by those people while trying to eat my breakfast makes my stomach ache. I don’t think I’d be able to get anything down.\n\n\n “Heh heh,” she chuckles, “Understood, miss. I’ll bring your breakfast here.”\n\n\n After the servant girl brings out and helps me change into some of Freida’s old clothes, she leaves the room. As soon as I’m alone, I collapse to the ground, head clutched in my hands.\n\n\n Oh crap. Something weird is happening. I knew that the guild leader and Freida had their eyes set on me, but why does the rest of the family want me now, too? Is it because of the pound cake? But, they have sugar here, so they have sweet things, right? There was that one sweet they brought out for me before, that pizza-like thing baked with nuts and drizzled with honey, right?\n\n\n This really isn’t something I actually want to think about, but if sugar has only just started appearing on the market, then the art of making sweets might not be well-developed yet… that can’t be what’s happening, right?\n\n\n As I lay there, head still in my hands, I hear the footsteps of the servant girl coming back with my breakfast. I quickly stand up and, with a careful nothing’s-going-on-here expression, go to greet her.\n\n\n “Please enjoy your meal,” she says.\n\n\n It looks like they figured out my tastes exactly after yesterday’s breakfast. There’s white bread with jam and honey, paired with juice from some sort of sweet fruit. There’s not as much soup, but there’s a proper full portion of bacon and eggs for me.\n\n\n Under these keenly observing eyes, it feels like my weak points will be found out in an instant.\n\n\n “Thank you for the food,” I say, and start eating.\n\n\n I feel like, once breakfast is finished, I should stay hidden in this room, claiming to still not be feeling well, until my family comes to pick me up. The guild leader and Freida are menacing enough as it is; I can’t face an entire family like that myself. I desperately wish that I could summon Benno and Lutz.\n\n\n As I slowly eat my breakfast by myself, thinking about how I’m going to deal with what comes after this, Jutte bursts into the room.\n\n\n “Good morning, Ma?ne. How are you feeling this morning?”\n\n\n She’s very hurried for someone coming in to ask me how I’m doing. I get the impression that I should keep my answer to just the bare facts, so I put down my bread and give her a foolishly honest answer.\n\n\n “My fever’s gone down, you know?”\n\n\n “Might I ask you for your assistance with the young mistress’s hair? I would like for you to show me how to put in her hairpins.”\n\n\n “…Sure, but can I finish my breakfast first, please?”\n\n\n I can probably count showing her how to use them as warranty service for a product I’ve made. I’m probably not doing this because I’m being too eager too help, or because Jutte’s staring at me strangely.\n\n\n I finish my breakfast relatively quickly and then head for Freida’s room, guided by Jutte. Her room is on the third floor. From what Jutte says, it seems the second floor is for the guild leader’s generation, while the third floor is for is sons’ and grandchildren’s generations. Since the two floors are tied together by an indoor staircase and everyone takes their meals together, it doesn’t really feel like it’s two separate houses, though.\n\n\n “Mistress Freida, I’ve brought Ma?ne to see you.”\n\n\n “Please, come in!”\n\n\n In Freida’s room, near the door, is a standing partition. If it were to be turned around, it could be used to section off the room into something like a parlor, so in one corner there is a canopy bed, and opposite that is a set of shelves that reminds me of a writing desk. In the middle of the room is a small table with a few chairs set around it. The curtains on the windows and the canopy are all done in girlish reds and pinks, but there are no dolls or accessories anywhere in the otherwise simple room.\n\n\n Today, hairpins and several combs are lined up atop the table. Freida sits at one of the chairs, her hair combed out. With her pink, fluffy hair let down and carefully combed out, she looks almost like a life-sized doll.\n\n\n “Good morning, Ma?ne. You feeling better?”\n\n\n “Morning, Freida. My fever’s gone down, but I’m still not totally better yet, I think.”\n\n\n In other words, I can’t do too much. When I give her my honest description of my condition, her expression clouds a bit, and her eyes drop.\n\n\n “Oh. Sorry to call you up here. I thought that since you were the one to make your sister’s hairpin, you might have been the one to style her hair, were you not?”\n\n\n “That’s right, so…?”\n\n\n “Do you think you could give me the same style, please?”\n\n\n Tuuli’s hairstyle involved bringing both sides of her hair together in the center and braiding them together in a half-up style. That kind of style wouldn’t suit Freida, but since I went through all that trouble for making two hairpins, and since pigtails are cute, I think the best style for her would be twintails.\n\n\n “Hmmm, well, since I made two hairpins, instead of doing exactly the same thing, let’s do it in two parts. I’m going to braid it, okay?”\n\n\n “I’ll leave it to you!”\n\n\n “Please, teach me as well,” says Jutte, her eyes glittering.\n\n\n I use a comb to separate Freida’s hair into halves, then start braiding one half of it together over her right ear, explaining what I’m doing to Jutte as I go.\n\n\n “Gather it up from here, then match it to this, and then twist it like this to make the plait.”\n\n\n “Gather it up from here, then I match it to this, and… like this?”\n\n\n Jutte takes the left side and, carefully observing what I’m doing, starts to braid. As expected of someone used to working with her hands, she’s very skilled. Since my hands are small, though, and since I am by no means handy, no matter what I try to do the braids keep slipping out of my fingers and coming loose. Tuuli’s hair is naturally wavy, so even if a braid is a little bit sloppy and a bit too loose here and there, that in and of itself just adds to the overall grand impression, but the quality of Freida’s hair means that any such mistakes would just immediately stand out.\n\n\n “Since you picked it up so quickly,” I tell Jutte, “I think it would be best for you to do both sides. My hands are small, so it’s hard for me to gather up all the hair.”\n\n\n “It certainly does seem like it would be difficult to try this with hands as small as yours. Very well, I’ll braid the other side as well.”\n\n\n Having already learned how after the first braid, Jutte sets to work, smoothly braiding the other side. Perhaps it’s because she’s working with hair she’s used to the feel of, but she leaves no holes or gaps as she works. Because Freida’s hair was so cleanly divided by the comb, it’s parted very neatly, unlike when I’d done Tuuli’s hair.\n\n\n …Nngh, it really hurts to see my own unskillfulness on display like this.\n\n\n “I’d be much happier if I’d had just a bit more time to practice, but…”\n\n\n Jutte mutters fretfully to herself as she looks at Freida’s done-up hair. My eyes go wide as I notice how intensely she’s reacting, and Freida chuckles wryly, with a troubled expression.\n\n\n “You know,” she says to me, “Jutte said that she really wanted to talk with you yesterday evening so that she could spend all night practicing.”\n\n\n “Ahh, and then I got tired and went to bed early, so… I’m sorry!”\n\n\n As I try to apologize for having caused her trouble by my feebleness, Jutte quickly shakes her head.\n\n\n “Don’t worry about it at all. It’s your condition, you couldn’t help it. I was just thinking… if I had known how to do this earlier, I could have done the young mistress up even more prettily.”\n\n\n Oh my, I see. Her hobby is dressing up Freida, is it? She is as cute as a life-sized doll. I understand perfectly! I, too, got fired up over making her hairpins.\n\n\n Next, when Jutte finishes with the braids over Freida’s ears, I carefully insert my masterpiece hairpins through the string binding them together and arrange them so they won’t fall off.\n\n\n Since there are four deep red miniature roses, no matter if you look at her from the front, the side, or the back, you can always see at least one flower. The way the spray of white baby’s-breath is set against her light pink hair makes the tiny flowers look like white lace, making the red of the roses stand out even more. The green leaves that peek out here and there accentuate everything very nicely.\n\n\n “Yep,” I say, “even better than I thought! These match you perfectly, Freida.”\n\n\n “You look quite adorable, Miss Freida,” says the servant girl who had helped me get dressed earlier, while Jutte brings over the garments that Freida will be wearing today.\n\n\n Freida stands up, and the servant girl takes the chair away. Immediately, every person in the room transitions into clothes-changing mode, and I hurriedly get out of the way. Freida raises one arm, onto which a sleeve is quickly placed; when she raises the other, it’s also sleeved much the saem way. Several people button down the buttons and tie up the strings, as Freida gets dressed without doing anything but standing there. I let out an amazed breath, watching the kind of princess-like dressing scene you’d only see in books or movies.\n\n\n If it weren’t for everyone’s many years of experience, this wouldn’t be going anywhere near as well. Not only do the servants need to know how to dress her, but Freida also needs to know how to be dressed, otherwise things wouldn’t go smoothly at all. If I were in the middle of that, me trying to raise and lower my arms would just end up with me hitting someone I can’t see, I think.\n\n\n Freida, still in the middle of getting dressed, looks over at me, smiling brilliantly.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, if you’d like, do you want to try watching the procession from this room? The windows in here were made specially to let me see outside better.”\n\n\n The windows of the guest room I had been in had wavy glass in them, but the glass in the windows here, in Freida’s room, the glass is perfectly flat, making it easy to look at the scenery outside. It wouldn’t be any exaggeration to say that watching the ceremonial procession through the windows here as it advances towards the temple would be like having a prime box seat.\n\n\n “Can I?”\n\n\n I glance back and forth between Freida and the windows. She smiles broadly at me.\n\n\n “Yes, of course! If you’re afraid to be here by yourself I can have Jutte stay with you.”\n\n\n I would indeed be uncomfortable staying in someone’s room while they were away, so Freida’s suggestion is most welcome.\n\n\n “That would be really helpful, thanks.”\n\n\n “Certainly,” says Jutte, “I would be happy to accompany you.”\n\n\n Jutte’s face immediately lights up, probably from hearing that she can watch from this window. It can’t be helped that she’d want to watch her mistress Freida go out in her finest clothes, and if Freida has her stay with me, she’ll be able to see her in all her glory.\n\n\n “Thanks, Freida,” I say. “I’ll watch from here.”\n\n\n It seems like all of the dressing-up work, down to the boots, was finished while we were talking. The two servants who were crouched in front of her feet smoothly stand up and take a step back.\n\n\n “Miss Freida, we’re all finished.”\n\n\n “And nothing’s out of place, I wonder?” she replies.\n\n\n Freida, completely done up, turns slowly on the spot. Her outfit is white, with fluffy, warm furs around her neck. It’s embroidered here and there with bright red and pinks, matching both her hair and her hairpins.\n\n\n “Well,” she says, “this seems cute.”\n\n\n “Whoa, amazing, amazing!” I enthuse. “Freida, that looks really good on you!”\n\n\n “Miss Freida,” says a servant, “I’ve brought your family to see you.”\n\n\n It seems that as we were praising her, the rest of her family had been told that she was done getting ready and had come here to see. The first person to step out from around the screen is the guild leader.\n\n\n “Oh, Freida! You look magnificent. Wearing such beautiful flowers during the winter’s baptismal ceremonies, you look like an angel… no, a goddess of the blooming spring! You are truly lovely. As expected of my granddaughter!”\n\n\n “These hairpins you bought for me really suit me, don’t they?” she says, smiling, lightly touching her hairpins.\n\n\n A broad grin splits the guild leader’s face. “They really do. Your delighted smile is worth more than anything in the world.”\n\n\n The rest of the family starts to enter, one by one, as if they had been waiting for the guild leader to get enough praise in before interrupting.\n\n\n “Whoa, Freida. That look really suits you.”\n\n\n “Out of all the girls I know… you’re the cutest!”\n\n\n Two young boys, about the same age—probably about ten or ten and a half years old—start to praise Freida.\n\n\n …Huh? A little while ago I was thinking that maybe Freida wasn’t used to being praised like this, but these two boys seem to be acting like giving her compliments is no big deal, hm?\n\n\n I tilt my head questioningly to the side as Freida looks up at her older brothers with a troubled expression, like she couldn’t believe that she was being praised.\n\n\n “…Why are the both of you here?”\n\n\n “Why? It’s Earth Day, so we’re off from work. Didn’t we say we’d be here to celebrate with everyone?”\n\n\n “I’d heard, but until now I’ve never seen anything come from words like that, so I didn’t think you’d really be here this time.”\n\n\n …Wow, so these brothers don’t keep their promises. With that kind of uncertainty, she might be convinced that their compliments were just empty words too.\n\n\n The brothers, perhaps because they noticed Freida’s distrust, instantly grow pale and start coming up with various excuses. While they do that, a married couple wanders over, completely ignoring the situation and overlooking the two children.\n\n\n “Amazing, those hairpins.”\n\n\n “Yes, I want some for myself! How splendid they are.”\n\n\n As I watch the chaotic family gathering unfold, suddenly, the guild leader leans down, thrusting his face in front of me.\n\n\n “Ah, Ma?ne!”\n\n\n Crap! I’d been planning to lock myself in my room so that I wouldn’t have to meet these people!\n\n\n The guild leader, not at all caring that I stepped back with a squeak, clasps my hands tightly, moved to tears.\n\n\n “You’ve done so well. I must thank you, Ma?ne. This is the first time I’ve ever seen Freida so happy with something I’ve bought for her to wear. Just like you said, her delighted face is worth so, so much more than her surprise.”\n\n\n “I… I’m very glad you’re pleased, I put a lot of effort into it.”\n\n\n Eeeeeek! Save meeee, Bennooo!!\n\n\n “There aren’t many other people around here who understand these feelings. From now on, when I buy a gift for Freida, I’ll consult with you first! Incidentally, Ma?ne, there’s one thing I wanted to ask you about… guh?!”\n\n\n With a jerk, the guild leader is pushed away. For a moment, I’m grateful for my rescue, but it really is only for the briefest moment. The guild leader is suddenly replaced by many faces, crowding in to see me all at once.\n\n\n “You must be little Ma?ne, aren’t you? I’ve heard so much about you from Father and Freida.”\n\n\n “Yes, umm—”\n\n\n As I start to try to properly introduce myself to Freida’s father, I’m spun around to face someone else. I blink quickly to reorient myself, and see Freida’s mother in front of me.\n\n\n “Thanks for making friends with Freida. She’s been having so much fun lately and is smiling a lot more. As her mother, I’m really quite grateful!”\n\n\n “Th… the pleasure is all m—”\n\n\n As I start to try to express my own gratitude, her two older brothers shove themselves in front of me.\n\n\n I beg of you! Just give me a second to get a response out! …Ack, too close! Your face is too close!\n\n\n I’m panicked to the point where my voice doesn’t come out at all. I freeze up, my eyes darting back and forth uselessly. The brothers, without any reservation, poke at me and pat my head.\n\n\n “Huhhh, so this is Ma?ne? I’d only heard stories, but she really does exist, huh. I guess she’s not made up after all.”\n\n\n “She’s supposedly been here for a few days, but this is the first we’re seeing her, isn’t it? Ma?ne, your mouth’s just flapping, you know?”\n\n\n “She really does exist,” he says, like I’m some kind of rare monster with a low spawn rate, or some mythical beast?!\n\n\n “You two, isn’t it about time to go? Let’s head downstairs. Give Ma?ne a little space.”\n\n\n The one who reached out to save me from being crushed was Freida. Today, she really is a goddess.\n\n\n “Yes, yes,” I say, slowly trying to back away. “It would be really bad if you were late, so it would be best for you to get going, you know?”\n\n\n One of the brothers firmly grabs my right arm, and the other catches my left hand.\n\n\n “Let’s go together, Ma?ne. Come celebrate Freida’s baptism with us.”\n\n\n “Ah, no, I was just going to stay here and…”\n\n\n “You’re a guest of the family, it shouldn’t be a problem if you come out with us.”\n\n\n “Right, right! Celebrations are more fun when there’s lots of people, after all.”\n\n\n I, both arms firmly captured, shake my head frantically, but this overbearingly pushy family doesn’t hear a word of my complaints.\n\n\n Is this genetic?! Does the guild leader’s family have a doesn’t-listen-to-people gene?!\n\n\n Out of all of the people here smilingly watching on as my wishes are completely ignored, Freida is the only one who sighs and scolds her brothers.\n\n\n “You two, if she gets sick again because you push her around too much, I’ll get scolded too, you know? Ma?ne has the same devouring fever I do, please don’t make her do too much. Her family’s coming to get her this afternoon, but if her fever comes back or she faints then that’ll be a problem.”\n\n\n “But, we finally get to meet her. We just want to make friends, right?”\n\n\n “She’s still not feeling well, so we’ve decided that she’s going to stay in this room and watch the ceremony from the windows here instead. She can’t go outside. I’m sure she wants to go outside, but…”\n\n\n It seems that she’s evoking images of herself, not able to go outside because nobody knows when she might collapse from the devouring, enviously watching the world pass by her window. Her older brothers instantly look much more serious, and they let go of my arms.\n\n\n “Now, everyone,” says Jutte. “The bell is about to ring. The young mistress must go outside to make her debut.”\n\n\n At her word, the rest of the family gathers up around Freida, then quickly bustles off, leaving me with the impression that I just watched the passing of a hurricane. It looks like it really was the right decision to not have breakfast with them. If they kept firing questions off at me with that much force, jerking me around like that, I’d definitely pass out for days afterward.\n\n\n “Miss Ma?ne,” asks Jutte, “are you feeling alright? They aren’t bad people, but they can sometimes come on a little strong.”\n\n\n That wasn’t a little!\n\n\n I keep my retort to myself, and instead move over to the window. Despite the fact that there’s a fire burning in the hearth, it’s still chilly near the window. Jutte brings me a shawl, which I wrap around myself, and I look down out of the window.\n\n\n It’s very sunny outside, but the occasional glitter of a falling snowflake and the fog my breath leaves on the windowpane shows just how bitterly cold it is outside.\n\n\n Across from the window, I can see that Freida has already left the house and is now being admired by the neighbors, standing out like a queen amongst peasants. Surrounded by her family, she wears the happiest smile she’s ever had.\n\n\n From where I watch, amongst the few decorations that the children are wearing, the hairpins I made stand out conspicuously. I understand now just how Freida could have noticed Tuuli’s hairpins from her window here.\n\n\n Tuuli must have stood out just like this, huh. She was so cute that everyone must have been talking about her, huh.\n\n\n As I look down at Freida’s baptismal ceremony, all I can think about it Tuuli’s ceremony, how my father had a meeting he really didn’t want to go to, how my mother looked as she smiled, wearing her only good dress, and so on, and so on. Somehow, I really want to see my family again.\n\n\n “Miss Ma?ne,” says Jutte, “you look a little pale, is something wrong?”\n\n\n “When I see how happy Freida is down there with her family, I think about how I want to be with my family too. They’re not coming until the afternoon, though…”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n As soon as the noonday bell rings, my family arrives to pick me up, as if they were lying in wait outside. My father’s affection, as overbearing as it ordinarily is, warms my heart.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, were you lonely? Daddy was so lonely!”\n\n\n “A little, yeah. I was a little bit lonely.”\n\n\n Freida’s family invited us to have lunch with them, but my mother politely told them that she couldn’t possibly ask them to do more than they already had, and I struck the decisive blow by nagging her about wanting to eat her home cooking after so long, so we wound up going home without any significant resistance.\n\n\n “Aww, but I wanted to have a big feast too…” whines Tuuli, puffing out her cheeks.\n\n\n “Sorry, Tuuli. The food at Freida’s house is wonderful, but I really want to eat Mommy’s cooking even more.”\n\n\n “Eva,” chimes in my father, “your cooking really is delicious.”\n\n\n We head home, with me riding on the shoulders of my high-spirited father. It’s only been a few days, and the home I’m returning to is poor and worn out, but I can finally breathe a sigh of relief now that I’m no longer under constant mental strain.\n\n\n Freida’s house was full of extravagant meals, luxurious baths, and comfortable mattresses. Even though every single thing there was fascinating, the mental strain from being there wore me out completely. Everything was so clean and easy there, but for some reason, I never found myself wishing I could live like that forever.\n\n\n Ahh, at some point, I started calling this place home, huh…\n\n\n It was a stay at Freida’s house that made me surprised by the change in my own heart."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The day after I breathed a sigh of relief upon coming home, I head to Benno’s shop, accompanied by Lutz. Although the first sprinkle of snowflakes has started to fall, it’s imperative that I both inform Benno about my recovery and give him my thanks before the snow really starts to pile up, so I’m forced to leave my house.\n\n\n “Master Benno’s been wondering if you’d been pressured into something, or if you’d been recruited out from under him. He’s been really worried about you.”\n\n\n “Ahh, I kept praying for him to come save me, I wonder if he heard me?”\n\n\n When I was trapped in Freida’s house, I’d silently called for him, over and over, to come and save me. Maybe he picked it up on some strange wavelength?\n\n\n As I hum thoughtfully to myself, head tilted to the side in contemplation, Lutz scowls at me with a somewhat dissatisfied expression.\n\n\n “…What about me?”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n “Didn’t you pray for me to come save you too?”\n\n\n When I look at Lutz’s wounded expression, I just want to leap forward and tickle him without saying anything. Thinking about that makes me smirk, entirely unintentionally, and Lutz starts pouting even harder.\n\n\n “Why are you laughing?!”\n\n\n “I mean, you really did come and save me, didn’t you?”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n Lutz freezes, startled, like a deer in the headlights, and I can’t help but laugh out loud.\n\n\n “Lutz, didn’t you tell Freida that I’d get a fever if I was too active? Thanks to that, I got to sleep soundly, so I didn’t have to sit through dinner, which meant I didn’t have to listen to another sales pitch and feel bad about it… you really saved me!”\n\n\n “Heh heh, oh really?”\n\n\n Lutz smiles proudly, gripping my hand a little tighter, then moves a half-step ahead of me. Maybe he thinks that if he can block a little bit of the wind that’s hitting me, there won’t be as much snow falling on my head.\n\n\n “Good afternoon,” I say, upon reaching Benno’s shop.\n\n\n “Ah, Ma?ne,” replies Mark. “I am overjoyed to see that you’re well again.”\n\n\n The inside of Benno’s shop is both lively and warm. When Mark saw the two of us enter the shop, breathing little sighs of relief, he quickly came over to greet us. It seems to me that, even though the snow has started to fall, the number of people coming and going hasn’t decreased a bit, even though I’m hearing that some workshops have already closed down for the winter.\n\n\n I murmur this to myself, looking around the store, and Mark smiles down at me.\n\n\n “That’s because this shop still sells things during the winter,” he says.\n\n\n “Oh, is that so?” I reply.\n\n\n Since the days during which the snowstorms make it impossible to move around only increase as the winter goes on, I’d thought that people here lived in such a way that would make it impossible to spend money. It seems that I was wrong.\n\n\n “When the noblemen are shut indoors by the snow, they have a lot of free time to spend. Their purse strings slacken a surprising amount for the sake of finding things to stave off their boredom.”\n\n\n “Ah, I see, entertainment, huh…”\n\n\n I can’t make a game console, but things like trumps, karuta, hanafuda, sugoroku, and other familiar card games start bouncing around in my head. If I have the spare time to do so, maybe it would be a good idea to try making something like that.\n\n\n Lutz tugs firmly on my sleeve. “Did you just think of something?”\n\n\n “Something that would really be better if we had paper.”\n\n\n It’s possible that I could make card games work with very thin, wooden cards. However, that would require the skill to slice wood very thinly, as well as cut them to approximately the same thickness and size. It would be relatively simple to accomplish if I were to get someone skilled in woodworking to do it for me, but since we’re operating under the premise of “I’ll think of it and Lutz will make it”, I at least don’t want to make these until after our baptismal ceremony.\n\n\n I wonder if Lutz actually can make thin sheets?\n\n\n Besides, I have yet to actually see any evidence of paints in this world. Since I know dyes exist, it’s not unreasonable to think that paints might too, but there’s nothing in my house that could possibly be used to paint playing cards.\n\n\n For something like Othello or shogi, though, we might be able to make it work with just ink and a board. When it comes to the most ways to play with something, though, playing cards are number one.\n\n\n While I mumble to myself, deep in thought, I’m led into the office, where Benno abruptly leans in close to look at me.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you’re all better now, right?”\n\n\n “Whoa?! Y… yes,” I say, blinking quickly. “I’m sorry for making you worry.”\n\n\n Even with my reassurances, Benno still looks at me with deep suspicion, and won’t stop scrutinizing my face.\n\n\n “Master Benno,” says Lutz, “she’s fine. She was just thinking about something, there’s nothing wrong with her health.”\n\n\n “If you say so,” he replies.\n\n\n Perhaps Lutz’s words finally convinced him, as he suddenly turns away, walking to a table over by the fireplace. He sits down, letting out an enormous, heavy sigh.\n\n\n “Those magic tools were something that old bastard had gathered up, and he said he had to be extremely persistent in order to get that many of them, so I had to gamble on whether or not he’d actually let you use one of them, but…”\n\n\n “Ah, he tried to force me to work at his shop. If I hadn’t had enough money to pay him, he’d have wanted me to transfer over to his shop, you know, to pay off the debt?”\n\n\n “Debt… well, that’s to be expected. But, it looks like you had the money?”\n\n\n He grins a wide, triumphant grin. I nod at him, laying out the facts of the trap that the guild master and Freida had laid out for me.\n\n\n “Yes, sir. For the use of the magic tool, the guild master quoted the price to you as one small gold and two large silver coins, but the actual cost was two small gold and eight large silver coins, so―”\n\n\n “That old bastard!” shouts Benno, roughly scratching his head in frustration.\n\n\n “I just barely had enough money to cover it, which was a relief. It looked like the two of them were not expecting me to have the necessary funds, and were quite shocked.”\n\n\n As I continue explaining, Benno is momentarily taken aback, then murmurs to himself, “that’s right, I did increase her information fee…”\n\n\n He smiles broadly. “Well, if it gave those two a shock then that’s alright with me. However, be careful around those two. If you keep hanging around them like you do with your complete lack of a sense of danger, they’ll gobble you right up.”\n\n\n I, with my complete lack of a sense of danger, had made what I’m pretty sure was a pretty grievous mistake, but I think it should be best to tell Benno about it. However, as I start thinking about that, I find myself wanting to delay the scolding that’s inevitably coming, and can’t stop myself from picking the most roundabout way to broach the subject.\n\n\n “Umm, Mister Benno. I have a question. What kind of sweets are common around here?”\n\n\n “What do you mean?”\n\n\n I flinch as he glances at me with his reddish-brown eyes, and start adding to my explanation.\n\n\n “Well, sweet things are rare at my home, and are just things like honey and fruits, and then paru during the winter.”\n\n\n “Ah, that’s right.”\n\n\n “…So, y-yes. Mister Benno. This is a little off-topic, but Freida had sugar at her house. Is that particularly unusual?”\n\n\n Considering that there’s no sugar for use in cooking around my house, I think that it would likely be something that would have only spread amongst the upper classes. Even still, I want to ask someone who knows things about its distribution, if possible, hopefully be told that it’s something that’s actually pretty common for the majority of the town and it’s just that my family is too poor to buy it, or something like that.\n\n\n Of course, there’s no chance that the answer will actually match my fervent desire.\n\n\n “Hm, it’s rather unusual around here. It’s only recently started to be imported from foreign countries, and it’s gathered quite a lot of popularity in the royal capital and amongst the nobility, but… wait. You. Did you do something again?!”\n\n\n Seeing as how I’m already guilty of so many things, Benno almost immediately notices my scheme. His eyebrows go straight up.\n\n\n “Um, I made a kind of sweet called ‘pound cake’, and they seemed to really latch onto it…”\n\n\n “Oh, that!” says Lutz. “That was super tasty. It was really moist, and it melted in my mouth, and it was the first time I had something sweet like… wait, Ma?ne!”\n\n\n Although sugar has started circulating amongst the nobility, it seems that there aren’t enough kinds of sweets being made to consider this place as having anything of a pastry cuisine. A pound cake is a very simple, orthodox cake, but there’s no mistake: I overdid it.\n\n\n The two of them glare at me, and I am, as expected, filled with the sense that I’ve done something terrible.\n\n\n “Why in the world would you, confronted by carnivorous animals, stick your head out of the bushes like that?! Isn’t it obvious that you’d be devoured in an instant!”\n\n\n If pound cake has gotten him so enraged, then I can take some small comfort in having not instead made sponge cake or shortcake. Sure, that’s because I was nervous about the scales and that wood-fired stove, but, ultimately, that saved me.\n\n\n “I mean,” I say, “I’d promised Freida that I’d make sweets with her, and I was trying to think of a way that I could show her my thanks―”\n\n\n “If you wanted to thank her, your money is good enough!”\n\n\n What Benno is saying lines up nearly with what Freida had said to me earlier. To merchants here, once you’ve completed your transaction, anything beyond that is unnecessary.\n\n\n “Urgh, Freida said that to me too.”\n\n\n “Again?! What do you do when the person you’re negotiating tells you these things? Didn’t I already tell you to make sure if your opponent is actually okay losing?”\n\n\n Noooooo! I have no learning ability at all. Although, isn’t it only natural to want to give thanks to someone who just saved your life?\n\n\n “I just wanted to thank her for saving my life…”\n\n\n “So, in other words, the fact that her old bastard of a grandfather just deceived you fell right out of your empty head, did it?”\n\n\n “Ngh…”\n\n\n I’m at a loss for words after that. I can’t deny that, in the end, since I had the money, they saved my life. However, if I hadn’t had enough, and I’d been forcefully pulled away from Benno’s shop to work at the guild master’s, I’m sure my feelings would have been more complicated.\n\n\n “…Seriously, since you have the devouring, they can’t really bank on having you for any real length of time, so they’ve been going easy on you. If they were serious, you’d have been acquired long before you even noticed it. Don’t do anything to explicitly get yourself caught.”\n\n\n Ah, I see, I think I understand a little more clearly now. I’d been thinking that these traps they were spreading out to try to recruit me were a little too easy. It seems that they’ve only just been poking at me, since I’m someone who’ll either get crushed by the devouring or have to enter into a contract with a nobleman.\n\n\n “Umm, when you say they’d acquire me before I noticed it, what would that look like?”\n\n\n “The simplest thing for them would be to approach your parents and lay the groundwork there. There’s no way that they’d refuse someone offering to become your patron. They’d attack you from there, after your baptism, sending over an associate to say they’ll take care of you from now on, and without you even knowing about it you’ll suddenly be engaged to their son. The only reason they haven’t done that yet is because they don’t know whether or not they’ll still have you after a year.”\n\n\n “That’s, that’s terrifying!”\n\n\n I tremble, goosebumps covering my arms. Benno looks at me in amazement.\n\n\n “You finally got it? Looks like there’s a limit to your lack of fear. …So, you just delivered them this dessert?”\n\n\n I tilt my head to the side, not really understanding the meaning of his question, then explain how Freida and I made it together.\n\n\n “No, I don’t have the physical strength in order to be able to make sweets, so I explained the process to Freida’s household chef and she helped us make it. They had a lot of white flour, and sugar, and even a wood oven in their house, it was amazing!”\n\n\n “Yes, amazing, amazing! So, in other words, you gave them the entire recipe…”\n\n\n Benno has his head in his hands, a sight that makes me rather anxious. I had no idea whatsoever that a cake I made just to show my thanks could make such enormous waves.\n\n\n “Er, did I do something wrong?”\n\n\n “You gave away something that could be sold to the nobility for free. You’re an idiot, aren’t you?”\n\n\n To be perfectly honest, I have no idea what gets sold to the nobility and what goes to the working class. I get that a cake recipe is something that’s worth some money, though. I should be more careful in the future.\n\n\n “Urgh… So if that’s the case, then would it be okay if I taught a chef here how to make it so we can sell it here too? There’s no way they could have started selling it by now…”\n\n\n “Acquiring sugar is still difficult.”\n\n\n Benno gives me a clearly disgusted look when I suggest that everything might be okay if we could get it to market first. Giving me that look doesn’t help the problem, though. Acquiring sugar isn’t my domain. That’s Benno’s job, the man who does business far and wide.\n\n\n “Well, I guess I’d better give up for now, then. If you can find a cook with easy access to sugar and an oven, I’ll give you the recipe to 'pound cake’ for free!”\n\n\n “…From the way you’re talking, it sounds like there’s more.”\n\n\n Benno, having caught on immediately, looks at me, but all I’ve got are recipes that you can’t make work without any sugar. Even if I were to tell him, there wouldn’t be any meaning to it. I, having recently been taught how recipes for sweets could be quite valuable, puff up my chest and turn my head away towards the door.\n\n\n “Any more will cost you,” I say.\n\n\n “Show them that stubbornness!”\n\n\n “…I’ll do my best,” I say, slumping dejectedly.\n\n\n I am not at all used to having things I’ve done out of good will turned into raw calculation, but since this is what the world of merchants is like, I have no choice but to get used to it.\n\n\n “Is that all you had to tell me?”\n\n\n “Ah, no. This is much more personal information, but I’m unable to leave my house in the winter, and I won’t be able to come to the shop until spring. Please don’t worry about me.”\n\n\n Benno and Mark, who’ve become overprotective after I collapsed right in front of them, are both here. Although I’m sure that even if I didn’t come to the shop there wouldn’t be any problems with managing the store, but it would be bad for me to make them worry about my health again, so I think I need to make this statement.\n\n\n “Unable to leave your house, you say?”\n\n\n “If I do, I’ll be stuck in bed again.”\n\n\n “Hmm? Didn’t you say you’d be helping Otto, though?”\n\n\n It seems that Benno somehow got the idea that I’d be going to the gates frequently during the winter, but that’s not quite right. There’s no way my family would let me do something that reckless.\n\n\n “Ummm, only on clear days, when my health is good, and my father is working either the morning or the day shift. I don’t think that’ll be more than ten times over the course of the winter.”\n\n\n “…Will you really be able to hold down a job after your baptism?” he asks.\n\n\n “That’s something I worry about every day,” I reply.\n\n\n Benno, deeply concerned, may have asked me that question, but I’m really the one with questions for him. Is there work that I can actually do?\n\n\n “Well, it’s good that you’re thinking about it so hard. So then, how are you planning to deliver your winter handiwork? As the spring baptismal ceremony starts coming around, it would be a big help to have some stock here at the shop.”\n\n\n We’d previously discussed delivering our merchandise in full when spring came around, but it seems like that won’t be in time for the spring baptismal ceremony. It also appears that he doesn’t have much stock left from what we rushed to create for the winter ceremony.\n\n\n Lutz cheerfully raises his hand. “I can bring them,” he says, “depending on the weather. Clear days are for picking paru, so I can come to the shop on cloudy days, I guess?”\n\n\n “Ahh, paru, huh… I miss it. Paru juice is such a treat for children.”\n\n\n Benno smiles wistfully. Perhaps even Benno used to go picking paru back in the day? I smirk, suddenly imagining Benno splitting his spoils of war with Corinna. Lutz, sitting next to me, thinks about gathering paru for a moment, then gets a sly grin.\n\n\n “I’m definitely going to eat parucakes this year too,” he says.\n\n\n “…Parucakes?” says Benno, dubiously. “What might those be?”\n\n\n I start thinking of what the world would be like if the recipe for parucakes got out, then suddenly break into a cold sweat.\n\n\n “Ahh, Lutz. How about we keep that recipe a secret, alright? Otherwise we won’t be able to get any paru anymore.”\n\n\n The dried-up pomace left over after squeezing all the juice out of a paru isn’t something that humans can eat. It’s animal food. People, believing that, bring those rinds to Lutz’s family, trading lots of it in exchange for fresh eggs. However, if word of its usefulness were to spread, then paru pomace would likely be very valuable. In that case, I’d have caused a huge hassle for everyone expecting to be able to use it to feed their livestock.\n\n\n “Okay. It’ll just be ours to enjoy, then!”\n\n\n “Yeah, let’s leave it just between us.”\n\n\n When it comes time to head home from Benno’s, snow has started to pile up, bit by bit, on the sides of the road. I look upon the signs that a full-blown can’t-leave-the-house winter has finally started, and breathe a small sigh.\n\n\n “Looks like the days I can’t go outside have started, huh.”\n\n\n “…Yeah, you’re right.”\n\n\n Lutz nods slightly, looking down at the snow accumulating on the road. Karla, his mother, had told me that the mood around the house wasn’t great. Lutz, the reason behind it, must be feeling that pressure even more. Winter, when everyone’s locked inside their homes, must be an especially harsh season for him.\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz. Come over to my house every few days, okay? Bring your studying stuff and any pins you’ve got finished.”\n\n\n The only thing I can offer him is a little room to breathe. Since it looks like Lutz’s family treats him harshly every day, and he can’t leave his house without good reason, it seems like it would be good for him to use his discretion about how many pins he should bring at a time.\n\n\n Lutz’s expression opens up a little at my suggestion. “Yeah, I’ll do that,” he says. “Thanks.”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n As the days of snowstorms continue, fewer and fewer people walk the roads. To endure the bitter cold, people refrain from going outdoors, passing the time away inside their homes.\n\n\n Since my father’s a soldier at the gates, even though it’s wintertime he can’t take a vacation from work, just like last year. Even during snowstorms he still has to work, so it’s rare for him to be home.\n\n\n At home, Tuuli works diligently on making hairpins whenever she has time. Since she knows for sure that this will bring in money, she works even more seriously at this than she did with weaving baskets last year. My mother, still showing interest in our winter handiwork, has to put making clothes for the family her higher priority. Since my baptismal ceremony is this year, she said, making me a good dress is her first task.\n\n\n “Altering Tuuli’s dress from last year won’t work, now, will it?”\n\n\n Tuuli, over the last year, grew even more. By summer, her dress had already started getting a bit tight. As such, she’d barely worn it. Altering it to fit me, though, wouldn’t actually save all that much labor, it seems?\n\n\n “Your sizes are way too different, so altering this would be a huge task!”\n\n\n My mother, troubled, smiles wryly as she says this. Ordinarily, nice dresses aren’t something you have to make a lot of. If there’s sisters in the family, it’s especially common for there to be hand-me-downs. However, Tuuli and I are very different sizes. When Tuuli was just turning seven in time for her baptism, she already looked like she was about eight or nine. I, however, still look like I’m four or five. Wearing the same clothing as her is, frankly, impossible.\n\n\n When I try it on, standing in the light of the stove, it drapes loosely off my shoulders and down my sides, the knee-length skirt hanging around my ankles.\n\n\n “Hmm…” I say. “Although, if we take the hem and take it in like this we could hide the length, and then if we pleat it like this it would be cute, I think, wouldn’t it? Then how about we decorate the areas around the stitches with little flowers?”\n\n\n “Ma?ne, that’s not just alteration,” laughs Tuuli as I stand there holding my hem in a pleat. “That sounds really extravagant!”\n\n\n It seems like they’re saying that since our sizes are so different, they’re going to alter the dress by undoing all the stitching, cutting it down to my size, and resew it entirely. It seems my suggestion of hemming it up to hide the actual length of it is practically heresy.\n\n\n I’m pretty sure this is the part where I’d rather not get scolded for doing something unnecessary.\n\n\n “Oh, is it? If it’s too showy, then I guess we should skip that. I guess I was just thinking that if we just took it in like this, then when I start getting bigger we could just let it back out again…”\n\n\n The only people who can use extra cloth like this are the kinds of people with lifestyles where they can afford it. Nobody who isn’t rich wears clothing with pleats in it, nor can they afford to add too many decorations, either. That’s why Tuuli’s dress had been made exactly to her size. Even if we’re only adding pleats to make it fit me, it’ll still wind up standing out a lot.\n\n\n My mother, who has kept her mouth shut during this, seems to have come alive with a strange eagerness. She grabs me firmly by the shoulders, smiling broadly.\n\n\n “…Let’s try doing it like you say, Ma?ne. If it doesn’t work, we can always do it the regular way. Right?”\n\n\n Ah. Crap. I got my mother fired up. She’s… not going to stop, even if I tell her the regular way’s just fine, is she? I’m already going to be way busier than I was last year, between making my own hairpins, tutoring Lutz, and cooking, though.\n\n\n Of course, there’s nowhere for me to run away from my overeager mother. At some point, while standing in front of the stove, wearing nothing but that nice summer dress, and holding it up while my mother pins it together, I, thanks to my frailty, catch a cold.\n\n\n Achoo!"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n After two days, my fever broke.\n\n\n Getting my new dress altered might be very risky. If things keep going like this, I’m going to get sick again before we can actually finish fitting it. Contemplating this, I get out of bed, and go looking for my mother.\n\n\n The kitchen table has been pulled close to the stove, and sitting at it are my mother and Tuuli, diligently working on their handiwork. It seems that since they couldn’t work on my dress while I was sick, they’ve instead been working hard on these instead.\n\n\n “Oh, Ma?ne,” says my mother. “Are you feeling better?”\n\n\n “Yeah,” I reply.\n\n\n “So, how about we get back to working on your dress?”\n\n\n She tidies up her handiwork, looking just a little regretful, and starts bringing out the dress.\n\n\n “Where’s Daddy? Morning watch?”\n\n\n “He’s on the day watch, but since it’s snowing so hard he left already.”\n\n\n Soldiers are used to shovel the main roads. While they are given extra money as special compensation for their work, my father constantly grumbles (when he’s drinking) about how the pay doesn’t come close to covering the back-breaking manual labor.\n\n\n “Now then, Ma?ne,” she says, unfolding my dress and holding it out for me. “Put this on, please.”\n\n\n I look at it, with its short sleeves and thin fabric, and my face twitches. If I do as she says, then even if I’m standing right in front of the stove I’m going to catch another fever.\n\n\n “Mommy, could I keep a long-sleeve shirt on? Just one’s okay.”\n\n\n “Your dress isn’t going to fit perfectly, you know?”\n\n\n “That’s okay. I’ll get bigger by summertime.”\n\n\n My mother puts a hand to her face as she tilts her head to the side, an extremely dubious expression on her face. She looks me over, as if considering her options, then lets out a sigh.\n\n\n “…That would be nice, wouldn’t it?”\n\n\n At least say something like “I know you will,” Mother!\n\n\n I, not wanting my fever to come back again, put on a long-sleeved shirt, then put my dress on over that, before surrendering myself to the alterations process.\n\n\n “So,” I say, “the biggest size difference is in the shoulders. How about this?”\n\n\n Just like my mother said, when I put on Tuuli’s dress the shoulders are so loose that it’s unsightly. So, I’ve tightly gathered up the extra width, draping it around my shoulders and making it into an off-the-shoulder dress.\n\n\n “It’ll fall off your shoulders like that, you know?”\n\n\n “Yeah, so we should add shoulder straps near my neck, made out of some kind of cloth or cord. If there’s leftover cloth from when this dress was made, then that would be great. If not, maybe some blue cloth? Something that would match the sash or the embroidery.”\n\n\n “We have some scraps left. It should be enough for shoulder straps, if that’s all we need.”\n\n\n My mother rummages about in her cloth bin, then brings back some scraps. She rolls them up into cords, then sews them on as straps. With that, a dress that was so loose that it might fall off my shoulders has turned into an off-the-shoulder dress, designed with straps like a camisole.\n\n\n “Ahh, it won’t fall off like this.”\n\n\n My mother gives a satisfied nod. Then, she scowls, pointing at my side.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, no matter how I look at it, that’s unsightly. What should we do?”\n\n\n With the cloth drawn tight around my shoulders, all the loose material has gathered under my armpits. I pinch at it, my head tilted to the side.\n\n\n “Well, since I’m going to be wearing a wide sash on my waist, it’s not a problem to have a little bit of extra material on the side, is it?”\n\n\n “It is. It’s unsightly!”\n\n\n “Oh, is it? Then, how about we sew some proper pleats into it? It would take some time, but it would make it cute, right?”\n\n\n I tuck the so-called unsightly cloth away into neat folds, demonstrating how to pull it back from my chest and towards my sides in three tacks. This kind of delicate sewing is very tedious, but it would get rid of the extra fabric and add decoration around my chest.\n\n\n My mother hums thoughtfully to herself. “…You’re right. That sounds good, then.” She sticks out her hand. “I won’t be able to sew that if you don’t take it off first, though.”\n\n\n I take off my dress and hand it to my mother. I immediately put on as many layers as I can, before breathing a sigh of relief. That was really cold. I think I’ll have another fever by the time we’re finished.\n\n\n “You’re lucky, Ma?ne,” says Tuuli, as she watches my mother sewing tacks into the dress. “That’s going to be such a gorgeous dress.” She sighs enviously.\n\n\n Sure, the dress is going to have a lot of loose fluttery bits and is going to look kind of extravagant, but that’s only due to the difference between our physiques. For the average younger sister, this kind of heavy alteration that takes up a ton of her mother’s time isn’t needed.\n\n\n “…It’s because our sizes are so different,” I say. “But starting from scratch is even more work, so this kind of alteration is all we can do. This dress was originally made for you, you know? You get all the new clothes. All I get are your hand-me-downs, you know?”\n\n\n “Ah, right…”\n\n\n It is the fate of those poor children born later than their siblings to never wear new clothing. (Even Tuuli, though, gets a lot of her clothes from the neighbors, so she doesn’t get to wear brand-new things very often, but still.)\n\n\n “While Mommy’s sewing, I guess I should work on my hairpin, too.”\n\n\n Since it’ll be some time before my mother is done sewing in the tacks, I get to work on sewing my own hairpin. Since I’m finally starting work on it after all this time, I want to make something a little different than the ones we’re making to sell.\n\n\n “Mommy, since I’m making a hairpin for myself, can I use our thread?”\n\n\n “Since we don’t have to make you a new dress, you can use enough for a hairpin, sure.”\n\n\n “Thanks!”\n\n\n Last year, nobody really knew what I was talking about when I wanted to make hairpins, so getting thread was a difficult process, but this year they know what I actually want to do, so I was able to get my hands on some without a fight. Filled with a fresh appreciation of the importance of mutual understanding, I pick up some un-dyed thread.\n\n\n “I think it went like… this…”\n\n\n I pick up my needles and, digging through my memories, start knitting a round flower, like a lily-of-the-valley. Tuuli, having finished up a hairpin of her own, comes to check out what I’m working on.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, what’s that? That’s kinda different from the flowers we did for Freida or for our handiwork, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “This is going to be the hairpin that I’ll wear for my baptism,” I reply.\n\n\n “You’re finally getting to work on your own hairpin, don’t you want it to look like Freida’s? Those were so wonderful, too…”\n\n\n Tuuli, who had been quite taken with the roses we made for Freida, rolls the lily-of-the-valley between her fingertips, lips tapered in a frown.\n\n\n “I’m using a different quality of thread, so I don’t think it would turn out the same.”\n\n\n I remember the intricate, glossy red roses we made for Freida, then sigh lightly. Even if I were to use the same pattern, they wouldn’t turn out the same in the end.\n\n\n As I ponder this, Tuuli grips her needles firmly. “If it’s okay that they’re not the same, then I’ll make them! You made a hairpin for me, so I want to make a hairpin for you too.”\n\n\n “Thanks, Tuuli. So, could you please make a flower like one of the big ones we made for Freida, except could you use this thread and make it a bit bigger?”\n\n\n Tuuli is delighted when I ask her to make the rose part of the hairpin. Since that rose is the largest, most eye-catching part, leaving it to Tuuli, who is more skilled than I, would make a much prettier result.\n\n\n “Tuuli, do you remember how to make it?”\n\n\n “I don’t have a problem with remembering things. Leave it to me!”\n\n\n …I’m sorry you have such a forgetful little sister.\n\n\n Having left Tuuli to work on the rose, I start diligently working on the smaller flowers. No matter how hard I’m working, though, my rate of output isn’t very quick, so by the time I’ve finished my third flower my mother has finished sewing in the tacks.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, come try this on.”\n\n\n “‘Kaaay!”\n\n\n I strip back down to one layer, then pull the dress on. It’s turned into an off-the-shoulder, pleated, one-piece dress. Because of the pleats, it seems to naturally flutter as it hangs.\n\n\n “Mommy, could you get the sash? I want to try it on.”\n\n\n “Good idea,” she replies.\n\n\n I tighten the wide sash around my waist, causing the skirt to gently flare out, almost like a balloon.\n\n\n “I wasn’t too sure about this while I was still sewing, but now that I can see it on you, it’s really cute.”\n\n\n “Because I’m cute, right?”\n\n\n “Because I’m good.”\n\n\n Our eyes meet, and we burst into snickers.\n\n\n She grabs me by the shoulders and spins me around. “Next is the hem. It’s still cute as it is, but it’s much too long.”\n\n\n The dress, knee-length on Tuuli, comes down to my ankles. I have no idea who decided this, but around here girls under ten years of age wear knee-length skirts. Incidentally, there don’t seem to be any miniskirts here, although if I had to say, since one- and two-year-olds have such short legs, knee-length on them is kind of like a mini-skirt.\n\n\n Also, and this is really bothersome, not only is it a problem if the skirt is too short, it’s bad for it to be too long, too. Shin-length dresses are worn between ages ten and fifteen. When a woman grows up, it seems like it’s most desirable for a woman to wear dresses so long you can’t even see her ankles. The only women who can get away with wearing floor-length skirts like that, though, are ones who don’t have to work. The dresses worn by working women, such as my mother, come down to the ankles.\n\n\n “How might we go about pinning this up like we did the shoulders, I wonder?” ponders my mother.\n\n\n “Maybe take it up twice in the back and twice in the front, I think… but, Mommy, what do you think?”\n\n\n “Hmm, that actually sounds perfect.”\n\n\n If we bring it up to knee-length in four places, we can make it look like a balloon curtain.\n\n\n After we sew everything into place, we use miniature flowers like the ones on my new hairpin to conceal the extra stitching. Then, after arranging the folds of the skirt so that the embroidery on the hem is visible, my new dress is complete.\n\n\n “That looks like a rich girl’s dress.”\n\n\n “…Yeah.”\n\n\n The dress has been pleated, given loose, fluttery sleeves, and puffed out like a balloon. This dress, which uses plenty of cloth for purely decorative purpose, is clearly not a poor girl’s dress, no matter how you look at it. All we wanted to do was take the unfashionably loose bits and hide them away with some clever sewing, but instead we wound up with a design that would be rare even in upper-class households. This is a dress that it quite clearly beyond our family’s station.\n\n\n “…Maybe we should have just remade it?”\n\n\n “If I had the time to do that, then I really would like to, but… this is, hm, really conspicuous, you know?”\n\n\n Tuuli, having overheard us, shrugs lightly, pointing at the half-finished hairpin she was working on.\n\n\n “It’s too late for that, right? Just the hairpin alone is really conspicuous already, so it’s not like it can get worse.”\n\n\n Amongst all the other girls, who merely had things woven into their hair, Tuuli and her hairpin had stood out from the crowd enough to catch Freida’s eyes. Since I’ve already decided that I’m going to be wearing a brand new hairpin, I’m going to be extremely conspicuous anyway, so wearing a showy dress isn’t going to get me any more attention than I already will.\n\n\n Freida had even said that drawing attention to myself would turn me into a walking advertisement for my hairpins. So, I stiffen my resolve even more.\n\n\n “We worked so hard already, and it’s cute, and I don’t care if I stand out. I’m going like this!”\n\n\n My very health was the sacrifice necessary to create this dress. Plus, unlike the miniskirt-length maid dress I was forced to wear at my high-school cultural festival1, this is a very reserved sort of design, so since it’s only knee-length there’s no need for me to be embarrassed by it at all.\n\n\n “Well, Ma?ne, if you say so, then that’s fine with me. Now, what are you doing for your hairpin?”\n\n\n “Since Tuuli’s working on this big flower for me, I’m making at least ten more little flowers like these.”\n\n\n “I’ll help you, too. It’s your celebratory gift, after all.”\n\n\n Chuckling to herself, my mother takes out her crocheting needles from her sewing box.\n\n\n “Thanks, Mommy. So, if it’s a gift, then can we use the blue and the light blue thread too? Enough for three flowers each.”\n\n\n “Well, now, if you insist.”\n\n\n “Yay!”\n\n\n We all get to our tiny, detailed task of making the hairpin. The three of us make short work of it. We end up with three large, white roses, three small blue flowers, three small light-blue flowers, and fifteen small white flowers. In the span of a single day, we’ve finished all of the parts.\n\n\n “How are you going to decorate this?” asks my mother.\n\n\n “Aren’t there too many small flowers?” asks Tuuli.\n\n\n “You’ll see in a bit!” I say, with a grin. “I’m going to make this part myself. Don’t look!”\n\n\n Even though I said that, though, there isn’t a single place in this house that I can actually work without being seen. The two of them pretend not to look, but I’m fully aware that they keep surreptitiously glancing over at me, full of curious questions but, since they are of course not looking at me, keeping their mouths shut. It’s actually kind of funny.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “I’m home!” says my father as he walks through the door. “Ahh, I’m exhausted again. All I got to do today was shovel snow and babysit drunk people.”\n\n\n It seems like he’d tried to brush the snow off of himself before coming in, but he still tracked a bit of it on. While Tuuli and I quickly work to sweep it up, I glance up at my father.\n\n\n “Daddy, did you finish the hairpin for my baptismal ceremony?”\n\n\n “Sure, wait just a bit!”\n\n\n My father smiles proudly as he brings out from the storeroom out a long pin that has been carefully carved straight and polished. When I realize just how much effort it must have taken to smooth this down so perfectly, my jaw drops.\n\n\n “What do you think?”\n\n\n “It’s beautiful. It moves so smoothly through my hair, and doesn’t get caught in anything at all. Daddy, thank you!”\n\n\n I take the small scrap of cloth that I’ve attached the three large white flowers to and sew it through the hole at the end of the pin. Then, I run my needle through that cloth, and start threading the small flowers onto it in clusters with small gaps between each flower, so that they can hang down, swaying freely, like a spray of wisteria.\n\n\n From the roses, the closest of the small flowers are the three blue ones, then the three light blue ones, and then five of the white ones. To add gradation, I add the remaining seven flowers in two more strands, giving it three in total. I’d made this based on the image of a pin that I’d worn with my yukata back in my Urano days, but this has turned out even better than I’d expected. This is definitely a pin to wear on an excellent day.\n\n\n “Whoa, that’s so cute, the way it sways like that!” enthuses Tuuli. “Try it on, Ma?ne!”\n\n\n “After all that work, you should wear it with your dress, too,” says my father. “Your daddy’s the only one who hasn’t seen it yet!”\n\n\n “That’s right,” adds my mother. “I’d like to see you in it too, and not over a long-sleeved shirt like before. Let’s see you wear it properly.”\n\n\n Pressured by my family, I change into my new dress. Then, I slide my new hairpin into my hair, next to the chopstick I’m still wearing.\n\n\n “Whoa, Ma?ne,” says my father. “This is amazing! Everyone’s going to think you’re some kind of princess. The way you look right now is way more elaborate and way cuter than you looked when you were wearing Freida’s outfit. You’d never be able to tell just by looking at you that this was Tuuli’s dress, just modified to fit you. Now that’s my Eva!”\n\n\n My father praises me while also extolling the virtues of his wife’s superior sewing skills, looking very moved. My mother smiles wryly at him, though, and finds a way to object.\n\n\n “It’s not fair for you to compare it to Freida’s dress. The quality is so different! But, compared to just normal alterations, this has turned into something quite extravagantly cute, hasn’t it! Working with so much extra cloth is really a whole different world of sewing.”\n\n\n “If the quality were the same, though, then I’d really be able to say that your work is the best!”\n\n\n “Oh my, Gunther!”\n\n\n The two of them are lost entirely in their own world, now. Watching the two of them banter back and forth, flirting, is actually kind of painful to watch. I never actually had much of this kind of social interaction in my Urano days, so watching it unfold before my eyes is something I definitely want to not have to do.\n\n\n I want to escape, but how?\n\n\n As I start drifting away into feelings that I’ve been completely left behind, Tuuli, who had been standing behind me and looking closely at my hairpin, steps back into my field of view, snapping me out of it.\n\n\n “Yep, cute! It’s really cute, Ma?ne! Your dress is showy and cute, but this hairpin is really good! The slow swaying of the flowers draws the eye, and since your hair is such a dark, night-sky blue, the white flowers really stand out!”\n\n\n “Oh, really?”\n\n\n Perfect, Tuuli. You’re my angel.\n\n\n Latching onto her life-saving voice, I turn around so that I don’t have to see my parents. Once their flirty expressions have disappeared from my field of view, I let out a little sigh of relief.\n\n\n “When we were working I was thinking to myself, 'wow, isn’t this going to be too big?’, but now that you’re wearing it, it’s no problem at all.”\n\n\n “Your hair is really puffy and wavy, but mine is really straight and doesn’t have any volume, so if I didn’t make a big, showy hairpin, it wouldn’t look great if you compared it to my dress.”\n\n\n “Oh, yeah, I see…”\n\n\n We’ve only been talking for a few minutes, but already my thin summer dress is doing nothing to stop me from shivering in the winter’s fierce cold. Goosebumps stand up along my entire body, and an unpleasant chill starts racing down my spine.\n\n\n “A… achoo!”\n\n\n Startled by my sneeze, my mother pushes my father aside and comes over to me.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, we’ve seen enough of your dress already, go get changed and get to bed at once. You’ll get feverish again!”\n\n\n “Ah… achoo! Mommy, I think you were a little late. My spine feels all cold and shivery, and my neck is starting to feel a little warm…”\n\n\n I am very quickly changed into my pajamas and hustled towards bed, but I’m already certain that my fever’s begun to rise again. I crawl into my prickly straw bed, then let out a long sigh.\n\n\n Well, I guess I was already sure that I’d get another fever, so it’s not like this is something dramatically unexpected. I wonder, though, is my body ever going to get any stronger?\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1.

    "content": " \n\n\n\n As we work on our hairpin handicrafts, someone knocks on our front door. Tuuli and I exchange glances, then she gets up to see what’s going on.\n\n\n “Yes, who is it?”\n\n\n “It’s me, Lutz. I’ve brought some pins with me.”\n\n\n “Alright, let me open up for you.”\n\n\n Tuuli unlocks the door, and it creaks open, letting in a gust of fresh, freezing air. Lutz walks in, snow still clinging to him.\n\n\n “Whoaaa, it looks cold out there,” I say.\n\n\n “Is it snowing hard?” asks Tuuli.\n\n\n “The road to the well was completely covered, but it isn’t that bad out right now,” says Lutz.\n\n\n As we talk, all the snow falls off of him, landing where he stands, just inside the entranceway.\n\n\n “Here, some pins. Each of my brothers made three of them, so there’s nine here.”\n\n\n He sets the pin parts of our hairpins out on the table. As he lines them up in a row, Tuuli stands up and goes to fetch the decorations that we’ve finished so far.\n\n\n “Ah, so, how about we finish putting together the hairpins we can?” says my mother. “If we do that, though, we’re missing a few pins, you know?”\n\n\n It looks like while I was out sick, she and my mother managed to finish quite a few decorations. I glance at the decorations she lines up on the table, and pose a question to Lutz.\n\n\n “We’ve finished twelve decorations. You’ve brought nine pins with you. How many pins are we short by?”\n\n\n “Oh? Umm… three.”\n\n\n “That’s right! Good job. You’ve been studying hard!” Glancing down, I notice that he has a bag in one hand, carrying his slate and his calculator. “Mommy, Tuuli, can I leave you to work on the hairpins? I’m going to go help Lutz study.”\n\n\n Tuuli blinks incredulously, tilting her head to one side. “I heard that you go do calculations at the gates, but do you really know how to teach it?”\n\n\n “Um, yeah, I think I can teach basic reading and math.”\n\n\n I pout, sullenly, at how little faith my sister seems to have in me. Lutz, though, beams broadly.\n\n\n “Ma?ne’s really amazing at reading and math! Well, she’s also really amazingly weak, too.”\n\n\n You could have stopped after the first sentence, Lutz.\n\n\n Even though I shoot him a nasty glare, my mother and Tuuli got a good laugh out of it, so it doesn’t make a difference.\n\n\n Lutz starts pulling out his slate and some slate pencils from his bag, so I run to the bedroom to go get my own things. From the wooden box by my bed, I pull out my soot pencils and the little memo book that I managed to assemble from the usable parts of our slightly-failed paper prototypes.\n\n\n I’ve been thinking that I could work on my book-making project under the pretense of helping Lutz study. Ordinarily, when my mother and Tuuli are working diligently on their handicrafts, it feels really awkward to sit next to them and play around with this by myself. If I’m doing it while teaching Lutz, though, then the both of us are writing on things, so I don’t think it would look too out of place.\n\n\n Now then, let’s get back to working on this book!\n\n\n Since I’ve worked on this whenever I’ve been able to find bits of free time, I’ve gotten just a little bit of work done on writing down my mother’s bedtime stories, but it’s still not fleshed-out enough for me to really be able to call this little memo pad a proper book.\n\n\n With my memo book, soot pencils, slate, and slate pencils held in my arms, I cheerfully start heading back to the kitchen. Before I get there, though, I hear my mother speak.\n\n\n “Lutz, don’t Karla and the rest of your family not like the idea of you becoming a merchant? Are you sure you’re okay with that?”\n\n\n The sudden, serious question makes me stop dead in my tracks, my breath caught in my throat. Taking care to silence my footsteps, I slowly continue back into the kitchen.\n\n\n Tuuli, seated next to my mother, is rigid and unmoving. Across from her sits Lutz, looking back at her with a stiff expression. As I sit down next to Lutz, my mother looks between the two of us, sighing, then opens her mouth to speak.\n\n\n “I was wondering, you know, if Ma?ne was the reason you’ve been saying that you want to be a merchant. You’re such a kind boy, so I thought that perhaps Ma?ne said that she wanted to be one, and you’re following along to look after her.”\n\n\n “No way!” he immediately objects. “I said I wanted to be a merchant, and Ma?ne got me an introduction. She’s the one getting dragged along, not me.”\n\n\n Lutz was thinking that he wanted to become a trader, then he listened to what Otto had to say, learned about what citizenship meant, and decided he wanted to be a merchant instead. I honestly didn’t have much to do with that decision-making process at all.\n\n\n My mother nods slightly, quietly staring at him. “I see. You’re the one who wants to be a merchant. But, if Ma?ne goes to the same apprenticeship as you do, then you’ll continue to look after her like you’re doing now, won’t you? If you’re spending time on her, then you’re not going to do a very good job at your actual job as an apprentice. You’re going to do sloppy work if you’re preoccupied with her all the time.”\n\n\n I think my mother’s warning hit Lutz right in the heart. Sitting next to him, I can tell that this unexpected revelation has caused his breath to catch in his throat. Her warning struck close to home for me, too. She’s not at all wrong.\n\n\n While I worriedly grind my teeth, Lutz lifts his head determinedly to look at my mother.\n\n\n “…I want to become a merchant, no matter what. Since I have Ma?ne here with me, I think that’s actually possible. So, while I do want to be as much help to her as I can, it’s not like I’m trying to become a merchant for her sake.”\n\n\n That’s right, Lutz has his own dreams, and being a merchant would put him in a much better place to let him do what he wants to do than being a craftsman would. Talking with Benno and Mark has only made him more sure of this. He may be doing everything with me, but there’s no way he’s becoming a merchant solely for my sake. This is the fastest way for him to get where he wants to go.\n\n\n “Then, if Ma?ne can’t be there with you―say, if she’s too weak and has to quit her job―would you still continue trying to be a merchant?”\n\n\n Lutz clenches his fists together tightly on top of the table, looking steadily into my mother’s eyes. “Yes,” he says, nodding slowly. “Of course I would. My mom and dad are telling me to stop and just be a craftsman, but I’m not going to give up now that I’ve made so much progress. Even if Ma?ne tells me to stop now, I’m still going to do it.”\n\n\n “I see,” she replies. “…Well, that’s good then! All I’ve heard is what Karla’s been telling me, so I’ve been a bit concerned. Thanks for talking with me about this, Lutz.”\n\n\n To Karla, it probably looks like I’m making Lutz follow along behind me. That isn’t entirely false, given how visible my condition is, but it seems like she barely even half-listens to what Lutz says and is punishing him for the warped view of his goals that she thinks he has.\n\n\n And then, even though she told him to stop, he refused…\n\n\n I actually kind of want to know just what it was that Karla said to my mother, but I have a feeling she wouldn’t tell me if I asked. I’m pretty sure she’d just say that if I wanted to know so badly, I should go ask her myself.\n\n\n “Mrs. Eva,” asks Lutz, “I have something I’d like to ask you too.”\n\n\n “What is it?” she replies, tilting her head to one side. I can tell from the way she is looking quietly back at Lutz that she intends to answer seriously.\n\n\n Lutz breaths a little sigh of relief before opening his mouth. “Why aren’t you fighting against Ma?ne becoming a merchant? My mom and dad keep saying that merchants are people that everybody hates, so why let Ma?ne be one?”\n\n\n Well, merchants are people who always take their commission fees and pinch their profit margins, so I guess it’s understandable for a craftsman to think badly of the profession, but… isn’t saying that literally everybody hates merchants a little too harsh?\n\n\n As if she heard my thoughts, my mother smiles wryly at me, then frowns slightly, looking troubled.\n\n\n “I think everyone has different ideas about what merchants are like, so I can’t say anything about an entire profession like that. But, to answer your question… I think the reason I’m not objecting is that Ma?ne’s always been very weak, you know?”\n\n\n “Huh? It’s because she’s weak?” he replies, tilting his head uncomprehendingly to the side.\n\n\n My mother smiles a little. “To be honest, I wasn’t sure if there was a job Ma?ne could do. I couldn’t imagine that anyone would be able to find a use for her. So, if she’s found herself a useful job where she can do the things that she’s good at, and she’s working as hard as she can to do it, how could I possibly object to that?”\n\n\n My throat tightens a little when I hear those words. The motherly love she feels for me makes my eyes grow hot.\n\n\n “Oh, okay. …I’m trying my hardest too, but they still won’t accept me, though…”\n\n\n Hearing the bitter words he spits out, I reach out to put my hand on top of his.\n\n\n “It would be good if they would, wouldn’t it?”\n\n\n “Yeah.”\n\n\n “So, let’s make that happen. Which starts with studying!”\n\n\n “Yeah, you’re right!”\n\n\n Lutz smiles, and the mood immediately lightens. As the serious-talk atmosphere dissipates, Tuuli, who had been stock still the entire time, lets out a huge sigh of relief as she relaxes. She gets her sewing kit out and starts working on attaching decorations to pins. As I watch all this through the corner of my eye, I tap my finger on Lutz’s slate.\n\n\n “Now, let’s start by reviewing your basic letters. Try writing them out, let’s see if you remember them all.”\n\n\n “Got it.”\n\n\n After giving Lutz his challenge, I resume my book-making project, writing down the stories my mother told me in my memo book. The soot pencils I’m using are much darker than a regular pencil would be, but they don’t cost me any money to use, unlike ink.\n\n\n As I work, I occasionally glance over at Lutz’s slate to see how he’s doing. When I do, I see him writing out each letter without hesitation.\n\n\n Lutz’s studying is almost going too well. When we start our apprenticeships together at Benno’s shop, his time to simply study is going to be dramatically reduced. Since he knows that this is going to be the most disadvantageous situation he could be in, he’s devouring information like he was starving.\n\n\n Since his family’s displeasure at the idea that he might become a merchant is straining the atmosphere at his home so much, Lutz has been considering, in the worst case, leaving home entirely. For that reason, it’s really obvious that he’s in a hurry to cram every bit of information into his head as he can.\n\n\n “Nice, you’ve got all the basic letters memorized, and you’ve written them out so neatly! That’s amazing, Lutz!”\n\n\n “I’m just following your lead,” he replies.\n\n\n Writing clean, legible letters is no easy feat without having practiced countless, countless times. Lutz isn’t like me, with my experience from my past life. Now that I think about that, I really do have to admire his raw perseverance.\n\n\n “Since you’ve got your letters down, next let’s work on memorizing some words. Let’s practice by writing out ordering forms, which I think is going to be the most useful.”\n\n\n On my own slate, I try writing out a form for ordering lumber. Since this is something I wrote up countless times while making paper, I can get it down with ease. When I finish that, I also write down the names of Benno’s workshop and craftsman associates that I learned in the process.\n\n\n “This is the name of the lumber merchant. This is where you put the name of the person making the order. When we were doing this, Mister Benno was doing the purchasing and then delivering it to us, so we’d put his name here. These are the kinds of lumber…”\n\n\n Lutz watches me closely, trying his hardest to keep his transcriptions in pace with my writing.\n\n\n “When spring comes around, do you want to try filling out the order forms for our paper-making supplies, Lutz?”\n\n\n “Uh?!”\n\n\n “Let’s practice a lot so that you can.”\n\n\n “…Yeah!”\n\n\n Having a concrete goal like that seems to have fired up his determination even more, as he starts earnestly practicing writing these forms, making sure not to misspell any words. I watch him work for a little while, then open my memo book back up and resume writing down my mother’s fairy tales. It’ll still take quite some time for me to finish copying down all of these bedtime stories.\n\n\n “How about we practice math next?”\n\n\n Having finally finished one story, I lean back and stretch my arms wide, calling out to Lutz. He looks up from his slate, where he’s practiced his vocabulary countless times by now, then nods at me, setting aside his slate and pulling his calculator from his bag.\n\n\n “So, how about this for today?”\n\n\n I start writing out math problems on my slate. Today, it’s addition and subtraction in three digits. After I get eight questions down, I look over and watch him as he uses his calculator. Unlike before, he’s barely hesitating at all as he flicks beads around on the device.\n\n\n “Wow, you’re getting fast at that,” I say.\n\n\n “I memorized how to do the ones-digit calculations like you said, and that’s made this way easier to do.”\n\n\n “Yeah. You’re getting faster at that than I am…”\n\n\n The calculations that I’m teaching Lutz are simple enough that I can just do them in my head, so I haven’t really gotten any faster at using a calculator at all. As always, it’s much faster for me to just do the math on paper than it is for me to use a calculator.\n\n\n It’s because I keep lending him my calculator so he can practice.\n\n\n That’s the excuse I try telling myself. I don’t have a lot of time to work with it, so of course I’m not going to get any faster. If I were to actually have a calculator on hand all the time, though, it would… still be up for debate whether or not I’d actually practice as seriously with it as Lutz does.\n\n\n “Your addition and subtraction is looking pretty good for now. When the number of digits starts growing, you’ll use the calculator the same way.”\n\n\n “Things start getting messy when there numbers get big, though,” he says, scratching at his cheek.\n\n\n He’s been using a calculator for just about a month, though, so this is fantastic progress.\n\n\n “I don’t know how to do multiplication or division on this either,” I say, “so I guess we’re stuck there.”\n\n\n Since I don’t know how to do it on the calculator, for now, the only way I can teach multiplication and division is through the times table. The numbers here doesn’t flow off the tongue like they do in Japanese, so I’ll need to adapt how we’ll be reading the times table out loud. It won’t be as easy to say, but as long as he can give a quick answer when given a pair of numbers, that won’t be a problem.\n\n\n He’s also gotten good at reading large numbers and can accurately convert between currency denominations. With his absorption powers, if he tries hard during his initial training, I think he’ll be able to do just fine.\n\n\n …Now, what the heck do I do?\n\n\n What my mother said earlier is stuck very firmly in my mind. “If you’re spending time on her, then you’re not going to do a very good job at your actual job as an apprentice. You’re going to do sloppy work if you’re preoccupied with her all the time.”\n\n\n I am going to be nothing but a hindrance to Lutz when he’s trying to do his job. I have no strength, have no stamina, and am fundamentally useless. I guess I’ve got some use when it comes to product development, but since I don’t have any of this world’s common knowledge, without Lutz beside me to help me understand the situation, I’d wind up in a lot of trouble.\n\n\n Now that I think about it, I made Benno worry, too.\n\n\n I recall how he had asked me if I, with my condition, could actually work. I hum to myself thoughtfully as I ponder the answer. Here in the dead of winter, I have nothing but time to worry about this, so I absolutely have to think about this properly.\n\n\n Can I actually work without being a hindrance to Lutz… or to the other employees at the shop? I wonder, what should I do?\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, I still didn’t have a good answer, so I continue thinking about it as I idly work with my crocheting needles.\n\n\n As I work, my father calls out to me. “Ma?ne, if you’re feeling up to it, do you want to go to the gates? The snowstorm’s let up for today.”\n\n\n “Sure, I’ll go!”\n\n\n I stand up with a clatter, immediately rushing to get ready to head out. I put my slate and slate pencils in my bag, then put on as many layers of clothing as I can so that I can brave the cold outdoors.\n\n\n Otto is at the gates. He’ll have a merchant’s perspective and he’s a relatively uninvolved third party, so I’m certain he’ll be able to give me his unvarnished opinion if I ask him.\n\n\n I’ll try asking him for advice about whether or not it’s actually alright for me to become an apprentice at Benno’s shop."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n When I step outside, I am dumbfounded by just how much snow has accumulated. During the winter, I’m essentially just a shut-in, so I’ve almost never really been outside like this before. So, when I look up at the snow, piled higher than I am tall, I can’t help but stare blankly in awe. Through the alleys leading to the main streets, a narrow pathway has been shoveled out, allowing travelers to somehow manage to make their way forward, but the mounds of snow alongside the path look terrifyingly close to crumbling down on top of us.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, up here,” says my father. He leans down, stretching both arms wide, and I quietly let myself be picked up, clinging to his head. If I were to try to walk through this, we wouldn’t make it to the gate in time for my father’s shift. Now that I’m being held up, though, my head is above the snow. A cool wind blows across the broad, white expanse, sending eddies glimmering across its surface like ocean waves.\n\n\n “Daddy, are you going to be shoveling snow on the main street today?”\n\n\n “The noblemen have to be able to drive their carts,” he agrees.\n\n\n “…In this snow, I’d think I’d rather stay inside.”\n\n\n With this much snow on the ground, I thought there wouldn’t be that many people out and about, but there are quite a few more people hurrying about their business than I expected.\n\n\n “There’s a lot of snow out here, but there’s still so many people outside,” I say.\n\n\n “It’s one of those rare days when the snow isn’t falling, isn’t it? When it is, there’s about as few people out as you’d expect.”\n\n\n As he says this, though, a sprinkling of snow starts fluttering down from the sky, prompting my father to pick up the pace.\n\n\n “It’s starting to snow. Let’s hurry, Ma?ne. Hold on tight!”\n\n\n “Aaah!! I’m gonna faaall!!”\n\n\n We arrive at the gate, clamoring the whole way. After taking a moment to roughly brush off the snow clinging to us, we quickly head towards the night duty room. After a light knock on the door, we push it open. A desk has been set up near the fireplace, atop which a veritable mountain of paperwork has been stacked, behind which is Otto, working on calculations.\n\n\n “Otto, your long-awaited assistant has arrived!” says my father. “Make room by the fire.”\n\n\n “Squad leader, thank you very much! I’ve been waiting for you, Ma?ne.”\n\n\n The documents atop the desk rustle as Otto tidies them up, making space for me to work at. Judging by the absolutely enormous smile he’s giving me as he welcomes me, it looks like the work has piled quite high, too. I pull my slate and slate pencils from my tote bag, then haul myself up onto the slightly too-tall chair.\n\n\n “Now then, Ma?ne. Please go over the calculations for this duty post, and make sure they match up.”\n\n\n “Okay!”\n\n\n Well, it looks like I won’t be able to have my discussion until this mountain of paperwork is first straightened out. I look at the pile of documents that had been set heavily on the table in front of me, and pick up my pencil.\n\n\n For a while, we work in silence. The only sounds that filled the room were the quick snap of beads from Otto’s calculator and the scratching of my pencil against my slate.\n\n\n A knock at the door cuts through the silence, and a young soldier steps into the room.\n\n\n “Excuse me. I have a question for Otto…”\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you handle this one.”\n\n\n Otto doesn’t even look up as he volunteers me, his eyes glued to his documents and his calculator.\n\n\n “Huh? Me? Oh, um, wait one moment, please, let me just finish this line…”\n\n\n I finish working out the calculation, mark the answer off as verified, then look up. The young soldier looks at Otto, who is flicking the beads on his calculator around with frankly terrifying intensity, then at me, then sighs, holding out a roll of parchment.\n\n\n “Please help me with this.”\n\n\n “What is it? …Ahhh, a noble’s introductory letter. Is the Private First-Class on duty?”\n\n\n “No, he has the night shift today…”\n\n\n “Then, get the chief’s stamp and make immediate arrangements for them to head towards the castle walls. Since it’s been a long journey through all this snow, even the gentlest noble might be on edge, so be as quick as you can.”\n\n\n “Yes, ma'am!”\n\n\n “If you do have to keep them waiting, I think you should make sure there’s a fire in the waiting room, get them in there immediately, and make them some warm tea.”\n\n\n “Understood.”\n\n\n The young soldier salutes, then rushes out of the room. I return his salute, then turn back around, resuming my calculations.\n\n\n “You’ve gotten good at that,” remarks Otto, taking a brief break from his calculations to rest his hands.\n\n\n My pencil keeps moving as I reply. “They’re all dealt with the same way, after all.”\n\n\n The work done at the gates is pure bureaucratic red tape. Fundamentally, the response to every situation is the same. Once you’ve read through the manual once, you can deal with everything that isn’t completely out of the ordinary.\n\n\n After calculating for another long while, I’ve gotten a little tired. I tidy up the pile of calculations I’ve verified, then lean back, stretching my arms wide. Otto, as well, seems to have found a stopping point, and starts gathering up his documents.\n\n\n “Man, I’m tired,” he says. “Shall we take a break?”\n\n\n “Please,” I reply.\n\n\n Otto brings in some hot tea from the mess. As we slowly sip at it, I start asking him for advice.\n\n\n “…and then, there’s what my mother said to Lutz when we were talking. She said that if he was always looking after me, then he wouldn’t be doing enough work to really be pulling his weight as an apprentice. If he was keeping his attention on me, he’d leave the job half-finished.”\n\n\n Otto gives me a look as if my mother’s words were the most obvious thing in the world.\n\n\n “Isn’t that obvious? If he’s only doing half of his work while looking after someone else… of course it would wind up half-finished. If Lutz is really aiming to become a merchant, he can’t afford to spend his time looking after you, I think.”\n\n\n “…That’s what I thought.”\n\n\n Right now, we’re not yet apprentices, so we don’t do any actual work at the store. We just go there to deliver our goods. As such, Lutz is able to keep an eye on my physical condition while we work together. When we become apprentices and have to do real work, he’s very likely not going to be able to stop worrying about me, and I can’t let myself put him under that sort of burden.\n\n\n As I sit there, wondering what I should do next, Otto looks down at me with gentle eyes.\n\n\n “Hey, Ma?ne. Are you serious about becoming a merchant?”\n\n\n “That’s my plan for now, yes. I’ve been thinking of a few things I might be able to commoditize…”\n\n\n My decision is based on the fact that you can’t buy or sell things without the approval of the Merchant’s Guild.\n\n\n “Leaving commerce aside, I think it would be better if you didn’t work at Benno’s.”\n\n\n It’s already been decided that my apprenticeship would be under Benno. I’ve lately been feeling anxious about my actual work, but I’d like to know why Otto is telling me that I shouldn’t work for Benno.\n\n\n “Why do you say that?”\n\n\n “That store’s growing quickly. Every single person there is working earnestly. It’ll be exhausting work, and I don’t think your body can take it.”\n\n\n The reason he gives me as he lightly shrugs his shoulders is the same reason I’ve been feeling anxious, and the same thing that I heard from Benno the other day.\n\n\n “…Mister Benno actually asked me the same thing, whether or not I could really do the work.”\n\n\n “There’s work to be done that just involves doing calculations and validating documents, but even a merchant’s job has deadlines, so it’s hard to entrust that kind of work to a girl who could collapse at any moment.”\n\n\n “That’s true, isn’t it.”\n\n\n I know full well that Benno has been thinking about how the information in my head could be turned into new goods or otherwise profited from, which is why he doesn’t want me to go to any other shop. However, when you think about my ability to actually work in a shop, my lack of strength and stamina is a fatal flaw.\n\n\n Hiring an employee whose health makes her actual attendance rate constantly uncertain would be a hard decision to make, even in Japan. If I were in charge, I wouldn’t want that kind of employee.\n\n\n “My other opinion is the kind of harsh thing you don’t really say around children, do you still want to know what it is?”\n\n\n I tilt my head slightly to the side in thought, and Otto studies my reaction closely. The ultimate reason I came here was so that I could get an honest, objective opinion from someone like Otto, who doesn’t feel like they have to handle me with care. Under the table, I clench my fists, steeling myself for whatever answer I’m about to get, then slowly nod.\n\n\n “Please.”\n\n\n “The number one reason I think you shouldn’t go to work for Benno is, frankly, human relations. You’re going to wreck the social dynamic of the shop. If a brand new apprentice is, thanks to her poor health, constantly taking time off from work and, when she’s actually there, only doing physically undemanding work, wouldn’t all of the other employees feel more and more upset as time went on?”\n\n\n “…Right.”\n\n\n Even if it’s made clear that the problem is my health, there will almost certainly be problems with the people who see that kind of favoritism, even if they aren’t immediately apparent. I’d been working so frantically to make sure Lutz secured his apprenticeship that I hadn’t actually considered what things would look like after I’d actually started my own.\n\n\n “And then… I think there’d be a problem with your wages, you know?”\n\n\n “Hunh? My wages?” I hadn’t even considered thinking about my wages being a problem, so my voice comes out a little weird. I tilt my head doubtfully to the side.\n\n\n Otto sighs. “You’re already bringing in a huge amount of profit to the store, Ma?ne. There’s no way the other apprentices will be making as much as you are, right?”\n\n\n “My base pay would be the same. I thought I’d just be getting my share of the profits added as a special case…”\n\n\n Although Lutz and I have waived our profits for making paper in order to secure our employment, I’ve been planning on holding tight to the profits on any goods we come up with after that. I have no intention of handing over all of my secrets for free.\n\n\n “Even if it’s a special case, you’re still going to be a brand new apprentice earning more money than the ten year veterans at the store. I really think that’ll be a huge problem.”\n\n\n “Ohh…”\n\n\n Human relations certainly are very quick to strain when money’s involved. What Otto is pointing out is completely correct. On top of that, if human relations collapses, then there’s a high probability that the shop itself might go down too. A shop, ultimately, is made of people.\n\n\n “It really does look like I shouldn’t work at the shop, no matter how you think about it.”\n\n\n Every one of Otto’s points is correct, and I have no rebuttal for any of them. I’m starting to feel like all I would do at Benno’s shop is sow the seeds of discord amongst his employees.\n\n\n “And then, there’s one more thing I\"m worried about.”\n\n\n “What is it?” I urge him on. He’s laid out so much stuff already, I can take whatever he’s got left.\n\n\n He leans in a little closer, lowering his voice. “Ma?ne, your illness… it’s the devouring, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “Mister Otto, you knew about it?!”\n\n\n My eyes open wide, but Otto starts lightly shaking his head in denial.\n\n\n “Ah, no, I didn’t. I learned about it after Benno brought it up as a possibility. The other day, Corinna came to me and asked, ‘do you know anything about this disease called the devouring?’”\n\n\n “Miss Corinna did?”\n\n\n “A little while ago, Benno was unusually out of sorts, it seemed, and he said something about it to her. Something about how the devouring’s symptoms had suddenly manifested, and someone nearly died in his shop? Around then, the squad leader started acting extremely out-of-sorts, too. Between his behavior and what Corinna said, I pieced together that you must have been the one to collapse from the devouring.”\n\n\n “…I’m sorry to have worried everyone so much.”\n\n\n It looks like the story had spread far and wide. I’d collapsed in Benno’s shop and gotten carried to the guild master’s house. In hindsight, that must have been extremely conspicuous.\n\n\n “The squad leader said you’d been cured, but… from what I’ve heard from Benno, it’s incurable, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “…That’s right.”\n\n\n The magical implement might have staved off the devouring for the time being, but even now I can feel it building back up again. Freida, as well, had told me that it’s going to build back up to overflowing again in less than a year.\n\n\n “Have you told him?”\n\n\n “No, not yet,” I reply. “My family’s so happy now that they think I’ve been cured, so telling them that I haven’t been is…”\n\n\n Talking about the devouring would involve discussing a lot of extremely painful subjects, like how much magical implements cost or how much longer my life will actually be, so when the subject comes up I’ve been dodging around it as obliquely as I can. I don’t know much about it myself, other than “there’s a strange fever that keeps building up inside me on its own and if it overflows then I die”, so it’s really just difficult to talk about in general.\n\n\n Otto shakes his head slowly, a stern expression on his face.\n\n\n “You should tell them. Your father thinks you’ve been cured, so he probably thinks that you’ll be just fine going to work. Once you’ve made sure to take care of the things you need to take care of today, then we can start talking about your job prospects for tomorrow. If you’re just going with whatever works in the moment, you’re going to cause a lot of trouble for a lot of people.”\n\n\n “I understand.”\n\n\n Since I’ve recently realized myself that I have a tendency to charge ahead without regard for how much trouble I’m causing others, I have no choice but to meekly agree with Otto’s rebuke.\n\n\n “So, for the future, since you’ll need magical implements to live, if you want to meet with the nobility then you should go to the guild master’s shop, I think. Benno’s shop is big, but it’s still very new. No matter how hard he tries, history and tradition carry a lot of weight. That’s not the kind of thing you can get past so easily.”\n\n\n “That may be true, but…”\n\n\n As I waffle, Otto raises his eyebrows.\n\n\n “Is there some sort of problem with you not working at Benno’s?”\n\n\n “It’s not that I wouldn’t be working at Benno’s, it’s that I don’t like the guild master. He’s pushy, and the way he runs his business is…”\n\n\n Being overbearing might be a necessary quality for a merchant, but I can’t stand that he tried to deceive me by quoting a too-low price for a life-saving magical implement. I’m certainly thankful, but I have no intention of making his acquaintance.\n\n\n “Benno’s the same, isn’t he?”\n\n\n “Hmmm, Mister Benno’s pushy, and he’s greedy when it comes to money, and he’s the kind of person who tests other people the moment he meets them, but I can tell he’s picked up on a lot of my flaws and is helping me try to grow past them.”\n\n\n “Ohhh?” he says, an unsettling smile spreading across his face.\n\n\n His expression gives me pause. I’m absolutely certain my last sentence is going to go straight to Benno’s ears.\n\n\n “Also, I haven’t decided yet if I want to live the rest of my life stuck uselessly under a nobleman’s thumb.”\n\n\n Now that I’ve finally started to think that I actually want to keep living with my family, I’m finding it difficult to imagine wanting to live as a nobleman’s pet, especially when I don’t know what kind of treatment I would wind up facing. Like Freida, said, my choices are to either rot away surrounded by my family or to live out my life in a noble’s captivity. If I had to make that choice right now, I think I’d choose my family.\n\n\n “Well,” says Otto, “if you haven’t decided what you want to do with your life then there’s not a lot to talk about. If you’re not going to work for a shop for the sake of building connections with the nobility, then I think even more that you should think about your other options besides working at a shop. Honestly, from where I’m standing, if you and Lutz do the \"Ma?ne thinks it up and Lutz makes it” thing and make sure to keep control of the profits and the rights, there’s no need for you to actually work for a shop, I think.“\n\n\n I give him a big nod. I certainly haven’t been thinking about anything but working alongside Lutz, but if thinking is the only thing I can really do, then there’s no real need for me to work for a shop in order to do that.\n\n\n As I nod to myself, mulling his words over, Otto breaks into a beaming smile. It’s such a brilliant smile that it’s actually a little suspicious.\n\n\n \"Let me see… perhaps you could have a job that lets you work from home and keep a close eye on your health, like transcribing letters or copying paperwork, while also just focusing on developing new products? You could force your products onto Benno, and then when your health is good you can come help me with my work here. Your life wouldn’t be much different than it is right now, which I think would be great for your health in the long run!”\n\n\n “…I’ll think about it.”\n\n\n Maintaining the status quo might indeed be best for my body, but I’m incredibly wary of the intent behind that suspicious-looking smile.\n\n\n “Well, this is something you’ll have to talk about with your family first.”\n\n\n “I’ll do that.”\n\n\n “Now then, break time’s over. Let’s get back to it, shall we?”\n\n\n Otto clears away our cups, and I put my slate back out in front of me. My pencil clacks against its surface as I go back to working out the numbers, making sure there’s no mistakes in Otto’s calculations.\n\n\n Talking with my family, huh… I’m scared that if my father knew that I only had a year left to live that he’d go insane with grief.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Ma?ne, let’s go home.”\n\n\n By the time my father, finished with his shift, comes to the night duty room to pick me up, I’ve done far too many calculations. By this point, I’m dizzy. When I close my eyes, all I can see are numbers floating through my brain.\n\n\n “You’ve been a big help, Ma?ne,” says Otto as we leave.\n\n\n Otto, who’s been flicking beads around on his calculator this whole time, is still very energetic. I’m starting to think that clerical work involving nothing but calculations might be utterly impossible for me.\n\n\n “Daddy, aren’t you cold?”\n\n\n Snow lightly falls from the sky as we walk home. My father has wrapped me in his coat as he holds me in his arms, but while I’m nice and warm, I can’t help but think that he must be freezing.\n\n\n He just smiles and shakes his head, though. “I’m not cold if I’ve got you, Ma?ne. I’m actually really warm!”\n\n\n “Ah,” I say.\n\n\n He truly loves his family and is ridiculously devoted to his daughters. How will he react when I tell him about the devouring? I worry that his smile will freeze off of his face. It’s a scary thought, but… I can’t avoid this topic any more.\n\n\n “What’s wrong, Ma?ne? You’re looking a little gloomy.”\n\n\n “…Daddy, I’ve got something to tell you. About my sickness.”\n\n\n With just those words, my father stops walking, his face rigid. His mouth tightens, and he looks down at me very seriously. He casts his eyes away for a moment, then starts walking again, more quickly this time, hurrying as if he’s trying to run away from something.\n\n\n “Let’s talk about it when we get home. Your mother will want to hear about it too.”\n\n\n “Yeah.”\n\n\n I can’t tell what he’s thinking about, but my fathers arm’s tighten around me, holding me closer to him, as if he’s never going to let me go."

When she sees the two of us on the other side, she blinks a few times, and starts to look a little worried.\n\n\n “…What’s wrong, Dad? You’re looking kind of grim, you know? Is it too cold outside? Is Ma?ne too heavy?”\n\n\n “That’s mean, Tuuli!” I pout at her.\n\n\n My father gives me a thin smile. “You’re too light, Ma?ne. You need to grow bigger.”\n\n\n He sets me down and gently ruffles my hair. Now that his mood’s lightened a bit, Tuuli smiles slightly in relief. “Sorry, sorry,” she says, coming over and brushing off the leftover snow that was clinging to my head. In my heart, I applaud her for changing the mood so quickly.\n\n\n “It started snowing a bit on the way home, and it got really cold!” I say, with a sour expression.\n\n\n Copying me, she gives me a sour look back. “You got Dad to carry you, and you got him to wrap you up in his coat, so you weren’t cold at all, were you? I can’t do that!”\n\n\n Giggling, I head to the bedroom to put my tote bag and coat away.\n\n\n By the stove, my mother is working on putting dinner together. “Welcome home. …Shall we eat dinner first, then?”\n\n\n It seems that, despite what we were talking about, my mother had taken in my father’s strained mood and tense facial expression and guessed that something’s up. She frowns for just a moment, then smilingly gets to work setting the table.\n\n\n “Now, eat up!”\n\n\n “Looks good.”\n\n\n At my mother’s urging, we start eating dinner. We’re much less talkative than we usually are. I haven’t even said anything yet, but my father’s brow is furrowed, my mother is looking away, and Tuuli looks on anxiously. The atmosphere is already heavy. As I look around at the three of them, I lift a spoonful of hot soup to my mouth.\n\n\n Will it really be okay if I tell them? If I say something like “I’ve got one year left,” won’t my dad just go absolutely insane? How should I bring this up? I want to hide how expensive that magic tool was, too…\n\n\n I keep eating, but all I can think about is the conversation that’s going to come after this, and my heart starts pounding loudly in my ears.\n\n\n “Thanks for the food.”\n\n\n After my mother hangs up the tableware, she picks out some herbs that have a calming effect and boils them into an herbal tea. The cups clunk onto the table as she sets them in front of us.\n\n\n “Did something happen?” she asks my father, sitting down next to him. “It looks like you have something to say, don’t you, dear?”\n\n\n He shakes his head slowly. His pale brown eyes snap to me. It’s scary to see him look so serious, without a single trace of the lovestruck smile he always looks at me with. I gulp, noisily, my breath caught in my throat.\n\n\n “Ma?ne’s the one who has something she wants to talk about.”\n\n\n When he says that, everyone’s eyes turn to me. Even though all I’m trying to do is talk to my family, my throat has gone dry from the tension.\n\n\n “Umm, well, this is about my sickness, so…”\n\n\n What do I say now? How should I best explain this so that it’s easy to understand? Those are the only thoughts tumbling around in my head, yet the words I need to give a basic explanation won’t come forth. I break out in a strange sweat, and my head goes blank as I try to hurry my thoughts along.\n\n\n As I open and close my mouth soundlessly, failing to find my words, my father narrows his eyes at me.\n\n\n “You’ve been cured, haven’t you? You went to the guild master’s house for a few days, and when you were cured, you came back home. Isn’t that what happened?”\n\n\n “Umm, the short of it is that I’m not cured.”\n\n\n My explanation vanishes entirely from my blank head, and I just say the conclusion. It’s like I set off an enormous bomb in the middle of them. After a moment of stunned silence, they all simultaneously gasp loudly, their eyes going wide. Then, my father suddenly stands up, so forcefully it knocks his chair over, and slams his hand onto the table.\n\n\n “…What do you mean?!” he says. “Was the guild master lying to us when he told us you were?!”\n\n\n “You’re not all better?!” asks Tuuli.\n\n\n They crowd in close to me, my father from in front of me and Tuuli from the seat next to me. I frantically wave my hands, trying to get the two of them to calm down and sit back down.\n\n\n “Whoa, calm down, sit. I don’t know much about this myself, and I don’t really know how to explain this, so I just said the first thing that came to my mind, so that’s…”\n\n\n Grinding his teeth so hard that I can hear it, my father sits back down with a clunk. My mother seems to have somehow kept her cool. She picks up her cup with shaking hands, swallows a mouthful of tea, then urges me on.\n\n\n “Yes, please explain it to us properly.”\n\n\n Next to me, I see Tuuli reach out for her cup as well. I pick mine up too, take a gulp, and start talking.\n\n\n “My sickness is, um, called the devouring. It’s a really rare disease.”\n\n\n “I haven’t heard of it…” says my father, nodding.\n\n\n Tuuli, though, grips her cup tightly. In a quiet voice, she says, “Ma?ne told me about this before. She said it takes a lot of money to treat it.”\n\n\n “Money?!”\n\n\n This time, it’s my mother who stands up with a clatter, her eyes wide. She looks deathly pale. There’s no doubt that she had noticed that the guild leader had never asked us for any money. I’d hoped that, if at all possible, I could hide just how much money it was, but I think I’d better not try to do that now.\n\n\n “Mommy, I’m trying to explain, please listen,” I say.\n\n\n “……”\n\n\n She slowly sits back down, looking at me like she still has something to say. Feeling everyone’s eyes still on me, I begin to explain, starting with the devouring itself.\n\n\n “So, the devouring, it’s like a fever that’s always in my body, and sometimes it just starts moving around on its own, and it’s always just slowly building up. If I get really mad, or if I get sad enough that I feel like I want to die, or anything like that, then it starts running wild through my body. It feels like I’m being eaten alive when that happens.”\n\n\n “Eaten alive…”\n\n\n Tuuli is white as a sheet as she stares at me. She glances down at my fingers and then up to the fringe of my hair, as if checking to make sure I’m really not being eaten away at right now.\n\n\n “The fever is something that I can keep from moving around with my willpower. If I focus on the image of locking it up deep inside me, that works for a while, but it keeps slowly, steadily multiplying.”\n\n\n “M… multiplying?!”\n\n\n Tuuli, visibly trembling, squeezes my hand tightly.\n\n\n “When I can’t lock it up, then it just explodes out, like it’s going to overflow out of me. If it overflows, then I’ll get swallowed up, but… last time, when that happened, the fever flowed out, and I was drowning. The guild leader used a magic tool and sucked the fever away. He sucked up a lot of it, but now it’s starting to build up again, so I definitely haven’t been cured for good.”\n\n\n Tuuli, whimpering quietly, stares at me with moist, quavering eyes, looking like she’s almost about to start crying. Or, maybe, instead of “staring”, should I say that she’s making a face like she’s trying desperately not to start crying? I feel like I’m going to start crying too if I keep looking at her, so I turn my eyes away and instead drink another gulp of tea.\n\n\n “Then, um, Freida told me that I’m not really going to get much bigger, since there’s a weird fever always nibbling away at me. You need magic tools to cure the devouring, and only the nobles have those, so they’re really expensive. Also, if your family doesn’t have connections to people in the nobility, you can’t get them either, she said.”\n\n\n “So, then, it… really was the guildmaster that saved you, wasn’t it?” my father says weakly, his voice cracking. There’s no sign of his explosive emotion from earlier.\n\n\n I nod. “Yeah, the guildmaster sold me one of the magic tools that he bought for Freida. But, she also said that if I didn’t have any magic tools, then I should decide really soon what I’m going to do about it.”\n\n\n “Do about it? Does that mean there’s another way you can be cured?!”\n\n\n My father leans forward, hope blazing in his eyes. Even Tuuli, who looked like she was moments away from crying, has a glimmer in her eyes. Seeing their sudden hope hurts me deeply, and I tell them what I could do if merely living was my only goal.\n\n\n “She said my only alternatives were to either make a contract with a nobleman and be their pet forever, or to rot away with my family…”\n\n\n “Be their pet forever?” asks my father. “What does that mean?”\n\n\n From his facial expression, it seems he’s having trouble grasping the concept. Tuuli’s face is blank as she tilts her head to the side, perhaps because she didn’t understand the words I was using. My mother’s face is pale as she grips her cup.\n\n\n “Freida has a contract with a nobleman, so she has the magic tools she needs to be healthy. She said that since her family is a wealthy and powerful merchant family, the contract is really favorable for her. Since I don’t have any connections to any noblemen, any contract I get would keep me alive, but she couldn’t say how well I would be treated.”\n\n\n “…You can’t even call that living, can you,” he murmurs, weakly.\n\n\n I nod at him. From what I learned as Urano, I can’t imagine that I’d be anything but someone that does exactly what she is told, living without any freedom at all.\n\n\n “So, Ma?ne. How much did it cost?” asks my mother, unable to bear it any longer. “I can’t imagine that the magic tool that the guildmaster gave to you was free, you know?”\n\n\n I nod, but in my heart, I know that I’m sunk.\n\n\n “I had enough, don’t worry.”\n\n\n “But how much was it?”\n\n\n “It was a lot, but it was to save my life, so, well…”\n\n\n “I’m asking you, how much was it? You can tell me, right? Don’t keep secrets.”\n\n\n I try to dance around the topic, but my mother’s eyes flash dangerously as she gets angrier. I moan quietly to myself, turning my eyes away, then mumble out the answer.\n\n\n “…two small gold and eight large silver.”\n\n\n At the mention of a total that’s roughly what my father would make in two and a half years, everyone’s eyes go wide and their mouths drop open in shock.\n\n\n “Two small gold and eight large silver?! How did you get that kind of―”\n\n\n “I sold Mister Benno the rights to my ‘simple shampoo’,” I say, frantically. “The manufacturing rights, the distribution rights, the rights to set the price… I sold all of that to him, so that when the devouring―”\n\n\n “Whaaaat?!” shouts Tuuli, who has constantly been helping to press out oil to make it. “That stuff was worth that much?!”\n\n\n Since the manufacturing process is just gathering nuts and herbs from the forest and pressing them down for oil, it’s very labor-intensive but costs nothing to make. It seems like Tuuli can’t comprehend that something like that could be sold for such an enormous amount of money.\n\n\n “Yeah, it seems that if you sell it to the nobility, you can make a lot of money. He’s got a workshop for it and everything, and―”\n\n\n Just as I’m about to start telling Tuuli about the workshop for making rinsham, my father interrupts, shaking his head as he stares at me angrily.\n\n\n “That’s enough about that. Here’s what I want to know about: you’re sure it will relapse?”\n\n\n “Yeah.”\n\n\n “…When? Based on how you’ve been talking, you know, don’t you? You changed the subject so quickly, it’s something you don’t want to be asked, isn’t it?”\n\n\n I didn’t expect him to be that sharp. “Wow, you caught on quick…” I sigh.\n\n\n My father, just after hearing that the devouring wasn’t cured, had kicked over his chair and slammed his fists into the table. Of course I don’t want to tell someone that enraged just how much longer I have left. Even though I’d been planning to avoid it, now that he’s said that I don’t think there’s anyway I can weasel out of it.\n\n\n “I’m your father, of course I caught on. …Come on, stay focused.”\n\n\n He looks at me with glinting, pale brown eyes. I get the sense that if I try to deceive him, it won’t just be the truth that I’ll be running away from, so I open my mouth to answer.\n\n\n “…About a year.”\n\n\n “Wh―?!”\n\n\n “She said that she thinks the next time the devouring fever overflows will be in about a year, so I need to think about things now.”\n\n\n A heavy, oppressive silence blankets the room. My father, who I’d thought would be enraged, hangs his head, eyebrows tightly knotted together.\n\n\n Tuuli is the one to break the silence when she starts sobbing.\n\n\n “Guh… Ma?ne, you’re going to die? In a year? …Don’t say that!!”\n\n\n She cries loudly, like she’s letting out all the tears she’s been holding out, and leaps from her chair next to me, grabbing me in a tight hug. I wrap my arms around her and pat her on the back, trying to calm her down.\n\n\n “Tuuli, calm down. I’m not dead yet, you know. Freida and the guildmaster sold me a magic tool, so now I’ve got another year.”\n\n\n The words that I had hoped would calm Tuuli down instead act like oil poured on a fire. She shakes her head furiously, crying herself ragged.\n\n\n “Ngh… don’t talk about how you were dying! It’s only a year! I hate this! Hic… and you were finally getting better too! Like we could start going to the forest together again! You can’t just die!!”\n\n\n When I died as Urano, it was in a big earthquake, so I didn’t have to see any of my family’s grief. Did I make them cry so sorrowfully for me, I wonder? And now, I’ve made my new family cry, too. I’m such an awful daughter.\n\n\n “Don’t cry, Tuuli. Hey, c'mon now. Even if I don’t have any magic tools, there’s got to be something I can do about the devouring, and I’m going to find out what that is.”\n\n\n “And what if you can’t find it?! Then you’re gonna die, aren’t you?! No! I hate that! Waaaaaah!”\n\n\n Being held so tight by someone crying all over me makes my own chest tighten up. My eyes grow hot, and even though I was trying to hold them back, my tears begin to flow, too.\n\n\n “Tuuli… don’t cry. I’m the one who wants to cry…”\n\n\n “Hic… sorry, Ma?ne. I’ll help you look. There might be something that can cure you somewhere, and we’ll look for it, so… Nnn, but, even though I’m trying not to cry I just can’t stop.”\n\n\n My own tears still spilling, I pat Tuuli on the back as she tries her hardest to stop crying. My father speaks up, in a quiet voice.\n\n\n “What do you plan to do, Ma?ne? There’s the way Freida suggested too, isn’t there?”\n\n\n I sniff. “…Since I don’t know how a nobleman would treat me, I can’t even imagine wanting to be separated from my family. Hic… Freida said that the nobleman she made a contract with is allowing her to stay with her family until she grows up. So, what would have happened if he didn’t?”\n\n\n The answer is obvious.\n\n\n “She’d have been taken away immediately, wouldn’t she? There probably aren’t that many noblemen who’d wait, I think…”\n\n\n “…Mm, you’re right.”\n\n\n I have not even the slightest clue as to what in the world a nobleman would find useful about the devouring fever. However, I think that one who would grant some extra time after signing the contract would be someone benevolent indeed. If I consider that I’d be taken away as soon as the contract is complete, I know that I won’t have much time with my family at all if I go down that path.\n\n\n “So, you know, I’m thinking that it might be okay if I live with my family until I die. Uu… I don’t want to leave you all…”\n\n\n “Ma?ne…”\n\n\n Tears glisten in my mother’s eyes as well. She turns away slightly, as if she doesn’t want her children to see it, and wipes them away. My father keeps a neutral expression, his eyes fixed on me.\n\n\n “I’ve still got a year,” I say. “So, I’m going to try my hardest to do the things that I want to do, and live so that I have no regrets. …Can I stay here? Or… is it better for me to go away with a noble?”\n\n\n “Ma?ne, stay here with me!” says Tuuli. “Don’t you dare go away!”\n\n\n Both of my parents nod, as if Tuuli had spoken for all of them.\n\n\n I wipe away my tears, happy to be told that I can stay here, and give them a strained smile.\n\n\n “So, here’s what I actually wanted to ask you…”\n\n\n “There’s more?” asks my mother, startled.\n\n\n All of this exposition to make them aware of the state of my illness wasn’t actually asking them anything, though. Now that they know what’s going on, I’d like some advice from them.\n\n\n “It’s about… my work.”\n\n\n “You’re going to be a merchant, right?” asks my father, frowning doubtfully.\n\n\n Taking solace in the fact that my father is listening to me calmly instead of raging, I continue.\n\n\n “That was the plan, but maybe I was being na?ve, or maybe not thinking through it all the way, but… it’s not the kind of job that I can do, given my strength, you know? Mister Otto said something like that too, like I’d just be a bother at the shop.”\n\n\n “Ugh, Otto…” growls my father, irritatedly.\n\n\n All I wanted to do was get Otto’s objective, outside viewpoint. It would be disastrous if my father were to explode on him later. Frantically, I start outlying the plan he had suggested.\n\n\n “So, what he proposed was that I take a job I can do at home, like copying letters or official documents, then I can keep going just like I am now, selling things to Mister Benno and then helping at the gate when I’m feeling healthy enough.”\n\n\n “Oh, Otto said that, huh…? Hmm, he’s right. It’s best for you to stay home. You shouldn’t overdo things.”\n\n\n He sounds a little happy, his mouth quirking up into a smile as he confidently declares this. Both Tuuli, who is still clinging to me and sobbing, and my mother nod vigorously in agreement.\n\n\n “Um, I’d made a promise with Mister Benno to work at his shop already, though… is it okay to break it?”\n\n\n This is what I wanted to ask my parents the most, since I still don’t really know much about anything work-related in this town. Would there be issues if I were to break this arrangement?\n\n\n “It’s not like you’ve officially started work yet,” says my father. “Since it’ll be hard on him too if you suddenly collapse on the job, I’m sure it’ll be alright if you make sure you explain things thoroughly to him.”\n\n\n “Okay! So, even though I hate to waste a job offer that I’d worked so hard to get, I’ll try hunting for a job that fits my condition.”\n\n\n Perhaps I should consult with Benno to see if there really is a job that I can do at home. I’ll need to make sure to ask him in detail when springtime comes around.\n\n\n Because the conversation had dragged on for so long, the instant there’s a gap in the conversation an enormous yawn forces its way out of my throat. Seeing this, my mother claps her hands together.\n\n\n “If that’s all you have to talk about, go to bed already. It’s late!”\n\n\n “Yeah. Good night.”\n\n\n “Snf… hic… goog night…”\n\n\n Tuuli, still blubbering, accompanies me to the bedroom and crawls into bed with me.\n\n\n “Tuuli, don’t cry. You’re way cuter when you smile! Tomorrow let’s do lots of things together.”\n\n\n “Okay, yeah, let’s play together a lot! Because you’re here.”\n\n\n As I console her, I slip beneath the covers of my bed. She immediately follows, grabbing onto me tightly as if she’s not going to let me go anywhere. I decide to leave her be, if it’ll calm her down, and close my eyes.\n\n\n I thought my father was going go berserk or start screaming, but unlike what I was expecting he simply sat and listened to me, saying very little. I let out a sigh of relief, glad that I was able to properly say everything I needed to, and slowly drift off to sleep.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n I had decided to let Tuuli do whatever she needed to do in order to let her calm down as we slept, but now my eyes snap open as I realize I’m being strangled. I frantically unwind her arm from around my neck and escape from there.\n\n\n I nearly died! Not even from the devouring, but from being choked to death.\n\n\n As I rub my neck, I blink a few times. Ordinarily, when I wake up at night, the bedroom is usually pitch black, but now there’s a dim light filtering in. I rub my tired eyes, but this doesn’t seem to be a dream. The door is half-open, and I can tell that there’s still a fire lit in the stove. I can’t hear any voices, so I don’t think that both of my parents are still awake. Looking through the gloom, I see a dark lump on my mother’s bed; perhaps because she’s already gone to sleep.\n\n\n Did she forget to put out the stove?\n\n\n I quietly slip out of bed, stepping as lightly as I can to avoid waking Tuuli, and head towards the kitchen.\n\n\n In the gloom of the kitchen, lit only by the flickering of the stove, my father sits alone, drinking. Unlike the happy drunkard he is in my memories, he sits there, wordlessly drinking, and crying silently.\n\n\n I avert my eyes, as if I could hear his voiceless wailing, and quietly go back to bed."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The day after the family council, everyone was a little bit awkward around each other. My father’s smile looked a little bit lonely, my mother hugged me over and over throughout the day, and Tuuli kept suddenly bursting into tears. However, as the days pass, everything starts gradually returning to the same old day-to-day life that we’d been living before.\n\n\n “You don’t have to do that, Ma?ne. I’ve got it,” says Tuuli.\n\n\n “Huh? I’ve got to do it! Aren’t you the one who told me that I’ll never learn how to do something unless I do it myself?”\n\n\n Tuuli, who had previously been encouraging me to help out more so that I could work on building my own independence, thoughtlessly takes over my work. It’s unmistakeable that she’s taking even more special care of me than she already was before.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n I’m woken up by Tuuli’s excited shout. “Whoa, it cleared up! We have to go pick paru today!”\n\n\n The sky is still dim and gloomy, but it seems like there isn’t much snow falling at all. Tuuli had seen a little bit of light coming in through the window and thrown it open wide to check the weather, letting the freezing air outside come rushing in.\n\n\n “Tuuli, I’m cold!”\n\n\n “Ah! Sorry, sorry.”\n\n\n She closes the window, then immediately gets started in on her breakfast. I, too, eat my breakfast, while my family noisily hustles around the house. The instant they finished their food, my mother and father started gathering up baskets and firewood. My father, starting to organize things by the entryway, looks up at me as I, still unkempt, chew on my bread.\n\n\n “What will you do today, Ma?ne? Are you going to the gates?”\n\n\n “Nuh-uh, I was thinking that I’d go and try help picking paru, maybe?”\n\n\n From what Tuuli had told me, a paru tree is a beautiful and miraculous kind of plant. I’m not entirely sure what she meant when she said how it sparkles brilliantly with light as it spins around, though, so I kind of want to see it for myself. But, when my curiosity prompts me to say those words, every single member of the family turns to stare at me.\n\n\n “Absolutely not! You’ll either stay here and watch the house or you’ll go help out at the gates.”\n\n\n “Picking paru is very hard, too hard for you! You’ll definitely get sick!”\n\n\n “That’s right! You’re bad at climbing trees, and you can’t walk through snow so it’s impossible for you to help.”\n\n\n All three of them immediately reject the idea of me accompanying them to the winter forest to pick paru. Certainly, there’s no way someone such as me, who can’t even walk through the snow to get to the gates, would be capable of foraging in a snowy forest.\n\n\n “…Okay. You’ll be picking paru until noon, right? So, I’ll go to the gate and help out there while I wait for you.”\n\n\n I prepare my tote bag and get myself ready to head out to the gates. I’d thought that since my father had the day off Otto might as well, but it seems that around this time of year he shows up nearly every single day.\n\n\n My family loads up their baggage, including me, onto a sled, and we head off. I’d heard that everyone in the town goes to pick paru whenever they can, and based on the huge number of people dragging their sleds towards the southern gates, I’d heard correctly. The air is so cold that it bites into my skin, but everyone is filled with such excitement over being able to go and pick paru that the mood is very much like a festival. Even I am getting a little excited too.\n\n\n “Sorry,” says my father to a soldier at the gate, “but take care of Ma?ne for me. She’ll be helping Otto out until noon.”\n\n\n “Yes sir!”\n\n\n “Everyone, good luck picking paru!” I say.\n\n\n When we arrive at the gate, I get off the sled and wave goodbye to my family as they head towards the forest. I say hello to the gatekeeper, who I’m acquainted with, and head to the night duty room.\n\n\n “Mister Otto, good morning.”\n\n\n “Oh? Ma?ne? I thought the squad leader had the day off, didn’t he?”\n\n\n Otto’s eyes twinkle in wonder, and I nod, smiling slightly.\n\n\n “Yes, since the weather is clear today, he went to the forest to pick paru. I’ll be helping out until noon today.”\n\n\n “Ahh, I see, I see. Hm, until noon, huh…”\n\n\n Otto smiles broadly, seeming to immediately understand the circumstances, then starts laying out documents that he needs the calculations checked on. While he works on clearing a space for me to work, I thank him for the advice he gave me the other day.\n\n\n “Mister Otto, thanks for the other day.”\n\n\n “Hm?”\n\n\n “Umm, when you consulted with me about my job prospects. I told my family about the devouring, and about finding a job that I can do from home. When spring comes, I’m thinking I’ll consult with Mister Benno, too…”\n\n\n “Ah! Well, taking care of yourself is very important, so if Benno has no idea what you could do, then my door is always open if you’d like to ask about things you can do here.”\n\n\n “Alright!”\n\n\n I definitely notice a hint of something dark in his smile, but now that I’ve properly expressed my gratitude, I get to work on my calculations, feeling refreshed.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n After noon, my family returns from the forest, so I get back on the sled and head home. Since there were three of them out picking today, it looks like they’ve brought six paru back with them. Unlike last year, now we know that even the dried-up lees is useful, so my mother is in very high spirits.\n\n\n While my mother works on preparing lunch, Tuuli and I work on juicing the paru. Tuuli grabs the skinniest stick she can find from the pile of firewood, lights it in the fire from the stove, then jabs it into the fruit. In the next instant, just that little bit of the rind cracks open.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, here it comes!”\n\n\n “Got it~!” \n\n I stick a bowl under it, so as not to waste any of the creamy white fluid that starts spilling out. Entranced by the sweet smell, we finish draining the juice, then Tuuli passes off the drained paru to our father. He crushes the pit of the fruit, pressing the oil out of it. Since he’s able to lift the heavy weight we use for pressing oil, leaving that part of the task to him means that the oil is finished in the blink of an eye. Since the lees left over after the fruit has been thoroughly squeezed has actual use in cooking, we set aside four parus’ worth of it for ourselves, leaving the remaining two to give to Lutz’s house in exchange for eggs.\n\n\n After lunch, I head out, bringing both the paru lees and some fresh ideas for recipes. If I could only just use an oven, I could make a gratin or a pizza, but since all I have access too are a griddle and a pot, the kinds of things that I can make are sharply limited.\n\n\n “Hi, Lutz. Could you trade me for some eggs, please? By the way, I came up with a new recipe, do you want to try it?”\n\n\n “Yo, Ma?ne! I’m happy about the new recipe, but there’s nobody around to help out right now so we can’t start on it yet. Come on and wait in here.”\n\n\n Even though I finally brought them a new recipe, Lutz’s older brothers aren’t here, it seems.\n\n\n “Where’re your brothers? Did they go sledding or something, since it’s clear out?”\n\n\n “Those kids went out to earn a little change shoveling snow,” says Lutz’s mother.\n\n\n I had no idea this was a thing, since there’s no way I could participate, but it seems like some of the heavy labor of shoveling snow is something that kids can do in order to earn some decent pocket money.\n\n\n “Why’re you still here, Lutz?”\n\n\n “Someone’s got to juice the paru. If you wait too long, they’ll melt, right?”\n\n\n It’s true that you can’t just leave paru alone for a while, but I can’t help but notice that it looks like Lutz has been stuck with the housework, unable to earn any pocket money, and I’m realizing that he’s actually looking a little gloomy. But, since neither Lutz or Auntie Karla are saying anything, I figure that I, as an outsider, should probably keep my mouth shut.\n\n\n I’d at least like to help them with pressing the fruit, but since that’s something that fundamentally requires actual physical labor, it’s beyond my capabilities. All I can really do is watch as Lutz smashes the core with a hammer and Auntie Karla presses the oil out.\n\n\n As I absent-mindedly look on, I suddenly remember that I haven’t actually told Lutz about the family council. Letting him know that I won’t be working at Benno’s shop is something that I absolutely have to do.\n\n\n “Um, so, Lutz. I’ve, uh, decided that I’m not going to work at Benno’s shop.”\n\n\n “What?! Why?!”\n\n\n Lutz, his hammer raised high, turns to stare at me with wide eyes. Auntie Karla looks over at me as well, her eyes open a little wider too.\n\n\n “Umm… my mother mentioned something like this, right? I’d just be a burden on you. Plus, no matter how I think about it, I don’t have enough stamina for a job like that. I talked with Mister Otto about it, and he pointed out a few different things.”\n\n\n “A few things like what?”\n\n\n Lutz gradually starts moving his hammer again, urging me on with a stare.\n\n\n “Right, um. So, if a brand new apprentice keeps getting fevers and has to rest all the time, what do you think everyone else that has to work with her is going to think?”\n\n\n “…Ahh. That’s…”\n\n\n Murmuring quietly to himself like he might be starting to understand, he hits his paru. Auntie Karla, firmly pressing hers, squints.\n\n\n “You’d be a bother to everyone when you’re absent,” she muses, “and you being absent during your training would hurt you in the long run, too…”\n\n\n “That’s right. …Plus, I’ve still got lots of things I’m planning on making, and if they wind up being really profitable, I’m going to earn a lot of money, you know? So if there’s an apprentice that’s always absent, but she still makes a ton of money, wouldn’t that ruin human relations at the shop?”\n\n\n “You’re right…”\n\n\n Lutz scowls, nodding in understanding, but Karla looks a little astonished.\n\n\n “Well,” I say, “the bit about the money applies to you too, I think, but if you work as hard as you can, I think people’s reactions will be different. I think we should discuss this with Mister Benno in detail, though.”\n\n\n “Yeah, let’s make sure we talk to him in the spring.”\n\n\n I think it might be possible to keep Lutz’s profits separate from his wages. Then, he could be given the extra money secretly. After all, even now, all it takes to give someone money is to tap your guild cards together.\n\n\n “If you’re not going to work at the shop, then what are you going to do after your baptism, Ma?ne?”\n\n\n “In my case, I don’t know what I’m going to do about the devouring, so I’d work out of my home transcribing letters or official documents while coming up with new products, or helping out at the gates… I told my family that I don’t really want my lifestyle to change all that much.”\n\n\n “Ah, okay. Yeah, that’s probably better for your body.”\n\n\n Now that I have Lutz’s support, I let out a little sigh of relief. As I do, Auntie Karla’s expression suddenly brightens.\n\n\n “Well, now! If Ma?ne’s not going to work at the shop, then there’s no need for you to work there either, Lutz, is there? Now you can be a craftsman!”\n\n\n I tilt my head to the side, confused. What does me deciding not to work at Benno’s shop have to do with Lutz not working there? Lutz, however, raises his eyebrows high as soon as he hears his mother’s sigh of relief.\n\n\n “Huh?! What are you saying, mom?!”\n\n\n “What do you mean?” she asks, a complete lack of comprehension on her face.\n\n\n Lutz clucks his tongue. “I want to be a merchant!” he yells. “Ma?ne has nothing to do with it! I’m the one who dragged her into it!”\n\n\n She stares at him, looking as if she can’t believe a word he’s saying.\n\n\n “What did you just say?! So, you still are planning on becoming a merchant?”\n\n\n “Of course I am! I really wanted to be a trader, but after I talked with one I learned about how citizenship works, so I decided I wanted to be a merchant instead.”\n\n\n “Lutz, why didn’t you say anything about this before?!”\n\n\n “I did! Were you not listening, or did you just forget?!”\n\n\n It looks like she really hadn’t acknowledged what he’d been saying. She looks at him as if this is the first time she’s ever heard this.\n\n\n I, not wanting to intrude into a conversation between mother and son, watch quietly from my chair, not saying a single unnecessary word.\n\n\n “…You did say that you wanted to be a trader,” she says.\n\n\n She shakes her head weakly, a troubled expression on her face. It’s clear to see that she’s bewildered by how her expectations aren’t matching up with reality.\n\n\n “But, that was just a childish fantasy, wasn’t it? That was just something you were dreaming about, not something that had any basis in reality, wasn’t it? I didn’t actually think that’s something you really had your sights set on. I’ve been thinking that you’d eventually come to your senses.”\n\n\n I think that what Auntie Karla is saying isn’t unreasonable at all. It’s rare for someone who lives in the city to go any farther than the forest or the surrounding farmland. A trader is a foreigner that unexpectedly drops in from time to time, not someone that anyone typically aspires to be. It’s a childish fantasy, and he needs to wake up from it soon. Karla’s line of thought is probably pretty typical of people living around here.\n\n\n “…I really did want to be a trader. I want to leave this city, and go to other cities that I’ve never been to before. I wanted to see all sorts of things that I haven’t even heard of… and I still do! I’m still holding onto that dream.”\n\n\n “Lutz, you…”\n\n\n Auntie Karla rises halfway from her seat, looking like she’s about to say something. From her expression, it’s probably some sort of objection to his train of thought. However, before she can say anything, Lutz continues talking.\n\n\n “But, I talked to someone who used to be a trader himself. He told me that only an idiot would give up his citizenship. And traders don’t have apprentices, so it would be impossible for me, anyway.”\n\n\n “Well, he was right,” she says, looking a little bit relieved. She sits down with a thump.\n\n\n It seems that being a trader is an occupation that is very much something to avoid. I’d thought, naively, that being able to travel the world and see the sights sounded really fun, but I still really haven’t internalized enough of this world’s common sense.\n\n\n “So then, once I found out that I couldn’t be a trader’s apprentice, I started thinking that maybe I could just go out and be a trader on my own. Then Ma?ne told me that maybe instead of being a trader, I could be a merchant in this city. If I was a merchant, then I could still go to other towns to buy and sell things, she said. It’s more pragmatic, and more realistic to try to do.”\n\n\n She shrugs. “Well, compared to being a trader…” she says, tiredly. It seems like she had no idea that her son was serious about his plans to become a trader, so this might be a bit of a shock for her.\n\n\n “So, I told a merchant that I wanted to be his apprentice. He was only a second-hand acquaintance of Ma?ne’s, though, so he basically refused me right away.”\n\n\n “…Sounds about right.”\n\n\n With how the apprenticeship system works in this town, Lutz’s odds of actually becoming a merchant’s apprentice were really slim. So, probably, even though Lutz kept telling her that he wanted to be a merchant, she didn’t consider it to be any more than some half-hearted ideal. Then, working from that assumption, she might not have ever really fully listened to Lutz when he explained that he actually would be able to do it.\n\n\n “But, we got him to set out some conditions, and agree to let us apprentice under him if we met them. Ma?ne and I already met those conditions, so we’ve got his approval to be his apprentices. So, whether Ma?ne’s there or not, I’m going to be a merchant.”\n\n\n Karla finally looks directly at Lutz, a serious look in her eyes, noticing at long last that Lutz has started forging his own path forward.\n\n\n “…Lutz, even if you got this man’s permission to be his apprentice, did you really think you could do so if your parents disapproved?”\n\n\n “I already decided that I’d do it. In the worst case, I’d be a live-in apprentice. I got him to hear me out, I got him to set some conditions, and I finally started on a path towards becoming his apprentice. I’m not gonna give that up.”\n\n\n “A… live-in apprentice…?”\n\n\n Being a live-in apprentice is probably among the worst lifestyles you could have. First of all, as an apprentice, you can only actually work half of the week, so your wages are low. Plus, you have no family to rely on. A child suddenly forced to live on their own would find it both really physically taxing as well as time-consuming.\n\n\n His living quarters would be the attic on the topmost floor of the building. Summers would be hot, and winters would be cold. It wouldn’t be at all rare for the roof to constantly leak. Carrying things upstairs, especially water, would be an enormous undertaking. It’s not unusual for birds to nest in attics, like they do in Lutz’s home, so the smell would be horrific, too. Plus, unlike the rooms rented out for families to live in, there wouldn’t be any place for Lutz to cook, so he’d need to either get someone else at the shop to let him use theirs or eat out a lot.\n\n\n Naturally, that kind of lifestyle isn’t something that leaves you with any money left over. Rather, he’d need to constantly be taking advances on his pay, putting him in debt. The shop would provide the bare minimum to keep him alive, but until he grew up he would basically be living solely to work his apprenticeship.\n\n\n “Lutz, think about what you’re saying! Do you really think you could live that kind of life?!”\n\n\n I don’t think any normal parent would want their son to have to live such an austere life. She raises her voice so high it’s practically a shriek. Lutz, however, just shrugs.\n\n\n “I can, yeah. I’ve started preparing for that already.”\n\n\n In Lutz’s case, he’ll be able to save up the money we’re going to make from paper-making during the spring. If we use the bark that we’ve already got in the storehouse, we’ll be able to put quite a lot of money in the bank. By my calculations, even after buying the clothing necessary to be a merchant’s apprentice, he’ll still have a sizable amount left over.\n\n\n Plus, during his apprenticeship he’ll have half of his days off, which he’ll be able to spend with me, developing new products to potentially make money off of. If we can do that, then there’s no doubt that he’ll be making much more than an ordinary apprentice’s wages. He won’t have a lot of room in his budget to spare, but I think it’ll definitely be much better than destitution. I don’t think he’d have enough extra money to rent a place for himself, though, so he wouldn’t really be able to do anything about his awful living conditions.\n\n\n “…You’re serious about already preparing, aren’t you?”\n\n\n “Very serious.”\n\n\n After a long silence, Auntie Karla lets out a deep sigh, slumping her shoulders. She wears a complicated expression, like she’s given up on challenging Lutz’s seriousness but still can’t give up altogether.\n\n\n “I still think it would be better if you found a nice, steady job as a craftsman instead of something as unstable as being a merchant.”\n\n\n Lutz purses his lips in dissatisfaction. “…If I do what you say and become a craftsman, nothing’s going to change, is it?”\n\n\n Auntie Karla squints at him. Since he just effectively said he’s dissatisfied with his current life, her mood quickly grows sharp.\n\n\n “What do you mean by that?”\n\n\n “My brothers do whatever they want with me, and when I have something they want the just take it, and I never have anything left for myself.”\n\n\n “That’s… you’re siblings, so of course they take things from you, but they give things too you as well, don’t they?”\n\n\n She frowns, troubled. Lutz, however, immediately rejects her opinion.\n\n\n “It’s not like they can give my food back after they eat it, and when I get stuff from them it’s all just broken hand-me-downs, you know? And if the hand-me-downs are too awful to actually use and I get something new for once, then they immediately take it away!”\n\n\n The fact that the youngest child always gets hand-me-downs is something that’s true for me as well. However, while Tuuli is always helping me out, Lutz is constantly being ordered around by his brothers. I don’t know if that’s just what brothers do to each other, but the difference between the two of our experiences is enormous.\n\n\n “I set my sights on becoming a merchant, worked really hard doing a lot of different things with Ma?ne, and learned what it’s like to actually hold onto something I’ve earned. I want to see how far I can take myself without anyone getting in the way. I’ve never even considered being a craftsman.”\n\n\n Lutz, who has always been kept down by his family, has made it his goal to find an environment where he can be free of their control, and he was finally able to find a place where he might be able to accomplish his dreams.\n\n\n Auntie Karla hangs her head. “I didn’t think you were so serious,” she says softly. “I thought this was just Ma?ne dragging you along…”\n\n\n “I wouldn’t make this kind of life-changing decision if it was like that…”\n\n\n “I really thought it was, so that’s why I was objecting.”\n\n\n She lets out a long, deep sigh, looking down at the floor. She thinks to herself for a while, then slowly raises her head, a smile on her face as if she’d come to accept things as they are.\n\n\n “If you’ve thought it through that far, and this is something you really want to do, to the point where you even started preparing to leave home, then why not go for it as much as you can? Your father will probably object, but you’ll have at least one supporter in this family.”\n\n\n “Really?! Thanks, Mom!!”\n\n\n Lutz’s face is practically sparkling. He had long since giving up on earning his family’s understanding, so hearing something so unbelievable makes him so happy he could jump for joy. Until just a moment ago, he’d been forcing himself to look focused, but now his expression is something that a child his age should actually be wearing, and I can’t help but smile, too. Having even just one family member on his side must make a whole world of difference.\n\n\n When his brothers come home, Lutz is still in a good mood. The four of them work harmoniously together as they start making my new recipy.\n\n\n “Zasha,” I say, “could you and Zeke please heat the griddle? Lutz, please grate plenty of cheese and mix it with the paru lees. Then, Ralph, could you chop those lege leaves finely, please?”\n\n\n While I divide up the work amongst the brothers, I add some paru oil and salt to the bowl that Lutz is grating cheese into. Once Ralph is done chopping the basil-like herb, I add it to the bowl, and all that’s left is to mix it and grill it.\n\n\n “The griddle’s hot!”\n\n\n “Alright, then grill this please, like how you do the parucakes.”\n\n\n We grill it thoroughly, until the cheese gets crispy, then eat it. It looks kind of like _okonomiyaki_1, but thanks to the melted cheese that’s holding everything together, it has a very western flavor. This recipe is a variation on something I’d come up with in my Urano days, making use of leftover cooked somen or spaghetti noodles by chopping them up really finely.\n\n\n “It’s so simple, but it’s so filling!”\n\n\n “It would be really good if you added minced ham or veggies, too,” I add.\n\n\n “Yeah, now that I think of it, these would actually make a good meal on their own, unlike the parucakes.”\n\n\n Everyone eats their food, smiling happily about how delicious it is. In the middle of that, Ralph tries to help himself to seconds off of Lutz’s plate, but Auntie Karla smacks him in the back of his head.\n\n\n “Don’t take other people’s food. That’s greedy! How about you grill another for yourself?”\n\n\n Ralph, who had just gotten smacked on the head, looks at her with mild shock. Lutz does, too. After a moment, Ralph gets up to start grilling up his seconds, and Lutz goes back to eating, relieved. Karla watches the two of them, then smiles. Now that Lutz has convinced someone as influential as her of his problems with the rest of the family, it looks like things have calmed down around here, at least for now.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n After that, I return to being a shut-in. My life becomes an endless cycle of handiwork, tutoring Lutz, helping at the gate, and lying in bed with a cold, while Lutz keeps stopping buy to deliver hairpin parts, be tutored, and occasionally bringing completed product over to Benno’s shop.\n\n\n Eventually, the snow starts gradually getting weaker, and my wintry shut-in lifestyle comes to an end.\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. Okonomiyaki are a savory grilled food, kind of like a pancake with a variety of other ingredients inside."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The snow has begun to melt, and the days have grown clearer. The days are still cold, but my family has said it’s no problem for me to go out to Benno’s shop, so Lutz and I get ready to make our way there to settle the final accounts for our winter’s handiwork. Each person who helped with the work has entrusted me with a small bag to put their earnings into. I put these into my tote bag, along with the last completed hairpins, and we head towards the shop.\n\n\n Traces of winter still remain: the center of the main road has been cleared of snow, but in the corners of the alleyways there’s still some snowmen that have yet to melt, and along the sides of the road there are still mountains of snow that had melted a little bit and then refrozen hard. The faces of everyone who has gone out to meet the new spring are bright, and their footsteps are buoyant as they go to and fro along the streets. The number of carts and carriages on the main road has significantly increased as well.\n\n\n It looks like the number of people visiting Benno’s shop is much higher than normal, so even though we’ve arrived in the afternoon, where there are usually comparatively few people present, it seems extremely busy. As I ask Lutz if it might be best for us to come back later, Mark appears, walking towards us. It seems as if one of the employees that we’ve become acquainted with might have noticed us and called him over.\n\n\n “Good afternoon,” I say. “It’s good to finally see you again, Mister Mark.”\n\n\n “Ah, Lutz and Ma?ne! Blessings upon the thawing of the snow. May the goddess of spring bring you great favor.”\n\n\n Mark raises his right fist in front of his chest, then presses his left palm to it, fingers together, slightly bowing his head. I have no idea whatsoever what he could possibly be doing, so Lutz and I stare wide-eyed at him.\n\n\n “Uh? What was that?”\n\n\n “…It’s the way you greet someone in the new spring?”\n\n\n Judging by Mark’s tone of voice, he doesn’t know how we couldn’t know what that was, so I can guess that this is some sort of extremely obvious greeting that is exchanged around here.\n\n\n “This is the first time I’ve heard it. Lutz, did you know about this?”\n\n\n “No, it’s my first time, too.”\n\n\n If Lutz hasn’t heard of it, then it may be something unique to this particular part of the city, or perhaps it’s something occupationally-related.\n\n\n “…Is this maybe a greeting only merchants use?”\n\n\n “It is something that has always been done in my family,” Mark replies, “so I haven’t given it much consideration, but all of the socialization I have done outside of work has been with other merchants, so that might be entirely possible. Since business booms as the snow thaws, we wish blessings upon the thawing of the snow, and greet our fellows by wishing that the goddess of spring brings them great favor.”\n\n\n Having said that, he teaches us this merchant’s greeting. It looks like this is a greeting you give the first time you meet someone in the spring. I’m just going to file this away as something similar to “happy new year”.\n\n\n As Mark did a moment ago, I put my right fist in front of my chest, press my left hand against it, and try practicing the greeting.\n\n\n “Blessings upon the thawing of the snow…?”\n\n\n “That’s right,” he says.\n\n\n “May the goddess of spring bring you great favor, I think.”\n\n\n I quietly mutter it to myself over and over, but I’m fairly confident I will have completely forgotten about this by tomorrow. It’s times like this that really remind me that I very much want a notepad. I may have a slate tucked in my tote bag, but that’s not a notepad.\n\n\n “The master is presently conducting a negotiation. What matters of business might you need to speak with him about?\n\n\n In response, I start ticking off the things I’d like to do today on my fingers.\n\n\n \"Umm, first I would like to settle accounts regarding our winter handiwork. Next, since I’d like to resume paper-making as quickly as possible, I’d like to verify whether or not the craftsman has finished making the larger bamboo mats by now. Also, I would like to speak with Mister Benno about my apprenticeship, but it seems he’s currently busy?”\n\n\n “I understand. Very well; let us begin with settling your winter’s handiwork. He should finish his business while we work.”\n\n\n He guides us to a small table inside the shop. Lutz and I sit down next to each other, and Mark seats himself opposite us.\n\n\n “These are the last of the hairpins we made for our handiwork, if you please,” says Lutz, speaking in much more polite language than he’s used to using.\n\n\n He presents the bag containing the hairpins. Mark removes them from the bag to count them.\n\n\n “There are twenty-four here,” he says. “Including the ones you left with us during the winter, this makes a total of one hundred and eighty-six, is that correct?”\n\n\n “Yes sir, that is correct.” Lutz nods, having verified Mark’s final count matches the tally we had made on a small board.\n\n\n Each hairpin is worth five medium copper coins. From that, the handling fee Lutz and I are charging will be deposited directly into the guild. Then I take out the various bags that I’d brought with me in order to make distributing the rest of the money easier, and start dividing it up.\n\n\n To make sure that Lutz’s brothers don’t fight, we divide their share evenly across the three of them, excluding Lutz. Splitting it up is easy: each of them gets six large and two medium copper coins. As for my family, my mother made eighty-three, Tuuli made sixty-six, and I made thirty seven. Since these numbers are all over the place, splitting it up is a bit of a pain. My mother winds up with one small silver, six large copper, and six medium copper coins. Tuuli’s share is one small silver, three large copper, and two medium copper coins, and my share is seven large and four small copper coins.\n\n\n “With this number of pins, we should have stock to last us until next winter,” says Mark. “There’s quite a lot of demand for these! Since there are so many colors to choose from, our customers seem to enjoy themselves picking theirs out.”\n\n\n I smile, imagining a parent and child picking out a hairpin together.\n\n\n “Ah, is that so? I’m glad,” I say. “I made myself a hairpin as well, you know!”\n\n\n “How might it be decorated?”\n\n\n I giggle. “That will be a secret until the day of the ceremony.”\n\n\n Mark quirks an eyebrow. “Oh my,” he says. “Then, I shall look forward to seeing it on that day. Now then, you next wished to discuss the resuming of your paper-making, did you not?”\n\n\n “That’s correct,” I say. “We won’t be able to actually resume work until Lutz has had the opportunity to visit the forest and check on the state of the river, but since spring has come, I think that I would like to start as soon as possible.”\n\n\n Benno’s investment will only continue until the early summer, when our baptismal ceremony will be held. Thus, I’d like to resume our work as soon as we can.\n\n\n Mark nods slightly. “Very well. I shall ask the workshop about your order. If I’m correct, you wished for two bamboo mats, the size of a contract sheet?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir, thank you very much.”\n\n\n I notice several merchants leaving the back room, as if the negotiations taking place there finished at about the same time we had finished our discussion out here.\n\n\n “I shall go inform the master of your presence. Please, wait one moment.”\n\n\n After he momentarily disappears into the back room, he returns to lead us in. Since this is the first time I’m meeting Benno this spring, I promptly press my left palm into my right fist in front of my chest, delivering the greeting I’d memorized.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, it is good to see you again. Blessings upon the thawing of the snow. Oh, um… may the goddess of spring’s, um, great favor… huh?”\n\n\n As I struggle to remember something I’d heard just a moment ago without the aid of a notepad, Lutz looks at me in amazement. He steps in front of me, pressing his left palm into his right fist in front of his chest.\n\n\n “Master Benno, blessings upon the thawing of the snow. May the goddess of spring bring you great favor.”\n\n\n “Aha, yes, that! Blessings upon the thawing of the snow. May the goddess of spring bring you great favor.”\n\n\n Thanks to Lutz jogging my memory, I deliver the proper greeting. Benno, visibly trying not to laugh, returns our greeting.\n\n\n “Ahh, blessings upon the thawing of the snow. May the goddess of spring bring you great favor. …I have to say,” he says, chuckling, “that was a very sloppy greeting. Make sure you learn to say it correctly.”\n\n\n He taps the table with his finger, beckoning Lutz and I to sit down. We do so, and then talk about the spring well-wishing.\n\n\n “That was something we just learned from Mark a little earlier, you know. It’s not something either of us heard growing up, so say something like, ‘very good for your first try’, please!”\n\n\n “…Oh, is that so? Then, good work, Lutz. Now then, you wanted to talk about your apprenticeship?”\n\n\n Benno only praised Lutz, who’d completely remembered the greeting. I pout, briefly, before launching into today’s main question.\n\n\n “I won’t be apprenticing here after my baptism,” I say.\n\n\n “Huh? …Wait. Why are you saying this? Is it because I didn’t praise you just now? Well, you didn’t say it right, but at least you tried?”\n\n\n He rubs hard on his temples, uncomprehendingly, and forces out some praise for my greeting.\n\n\n “That’s not it! It has nothing to do with that.”\n\n\n “If not that, then what?”\n\n\n “Umm, well, I’m kind of weak, you know?”\n\n\n “Astoundingly so, yes.”\n\n\n His interjection stabs straight into my heart.\n\n\n “Urgh… You were worried earlier about whether or not I’d be able to properly do my work here, weren’t you? If you had an apprentice who was always taking days off because of her poor health and was only being assigned easy work that wouldn’t put a strain on her body then, if you think about it, wouldn’t that be bad for human relations here at the shop?”\n\n\n “Is that all?”\n\n\n He glares down at me with his reddish-brown eyes, and I remember the other concerns that Otto had raised with me.\n\n\n “Also, if I’m earning profits from my goods, then isn’t there the chance that I’d be making more money than even the veterans who’ve been working here for over ten years? Money’s the easiest way to ruin relationships.”\n\n\n “Who told you that?” he says, eyes narrowed. “There’s no way you would have come up with that on your own.”\n\n\n I nod vigorously. Back when I was Urano, the only thing I ever did or ever really wanted to do was read, so my field of view was pretty narrow. This time around, I hadn’t really been considering anything but my own physical strength. It took Otto pointing things out for me to start thinking about human relations.\n\n\n “Mister Otto,” I reply.\n\n\n “…I see.”\n\n\n Huh? I think his voice just now was pitched a fraction of a step lower… And then, he’s got a sort of predatory aura going on now… or am I imagining things?\n\n\n I tilt my head slightly to the side as I think about Benno’s ferocious aura, then say the thing that’s been weighing most heavily on my mind.\n\n\n “Also, you know about my devouring, right? If I were making the decision, then I don’t think I’d hire an employee that I wasn’t sure would still be around in a year.”\n\n\n It’s very likely that any resources spent on my education will go entirely to waste. I don’t think a merchant would be capable of wasting resources like that.\n\n\n Benno rubs his forehead, looking at me with sharply discerning eyes.\n\n\n “Then, if you’re not working at my shop, what do you plan to do instead?”\n\n\n “I’ll be transcribing letters or official documents at home, working with Lutz to develop new products on his days off, and from time to time helping out at the gates… basically, I’ll just keep doing what I’ve been doing. After talking with my family, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to do things that don’t place too much of a strain on my body.”\n\n\n “And being an apprentice and so on would. Got it.”\n\n\n The strain goes out of his eyes and shoulders. He rubs at his temples, looking like he’s trying to figure out what he’s going to do next. As he mutters to himself, I speak up again.\n\n\n “Umm, Mister Benno. Do you have any work that I might be able to do at home?”\n\n\n In that moment, Benno’s eyes gleam, and a slow, predatory smile spreads across his face.\n\n\n “Your writing is very neat, hm. I can send some amanuensis work your way, so stop by with Lutz from time to time. Alright?”\n\n\n “Thank you very much.”\n\n\n What was that just now? I feel like I’ve just been cornered by a carnivorous beast…\n\n\n Since my request was accepted so easily, I put aside my deep thoughts and move onto my other question.\n\n\n “Umm, so if that’s the case, what’s going to happen to my guild card? I’m planning on selling through Lutz, but I’m not going to have an apprentice’s card from your shop, right? I’ll be unaffiliated, right?”\n\n\n We had originally planned around my eventual registration as an apprentice at Benno’s shop after my baptism, but if I’m not actually going to be his apprentice, then I wonder what will happen to my guild card? Since it’ll be after my baptism, I don’t think they’ll let me have a temporary registration. However, if I’m not attached to a shop, I won’t be able to conduct any business without being registered.\n\n\n “I don’t know what kind of products you’re planning on making, but how about we call the storehouse you’ve been using 'Ma?ne’s Workshop’, register you as the workshop head, and get you a card that way? If you enter into an exclusive production agreement with my shop, then our business won’t be much different from how it is now.”\n\n\n “Workshop head?! That sounds kinda cool! If everything will be more or less the same as it is now, then yes, please, let’s set it up like that.”\n\n\n I clap my hands excitedly, and Benno nods happily.\n\n\n “So,” I say, “this is something that I mentioned to Mister Mark, but we’re going to be restarting our paper making as soon as we can go look at the river’s current condition. We’re currently planning on the two of us making the paper until our baptisms, but after that Lutz will be busy with his apprenticeship and I won’t be doing an apprenticeship at all, so I’m hoping that we’ll be able to pass the entire task on to a workshop you select. Is that okay?”\n\n\n “When you say the entire task, do you mean that you’ll still be the one picking the workshop? Is that right?”\n\n\n Our magic contract stipulated that Lutz and I would be able to have safe, stable employment at Benno’s shop. Since this is turning into a new industry, I think the people and the workshop making it would be particularly important to Benno. For me, however, I won’t have either salary or extra profit, so as long as a large amount of paper winds up in circulation, I don’t particularly care who winds up making it.\n\n\n “I mean, I don’t know anything about workshops, and I also don’t know anyone who might want to work on making paper. All I know is that since the process requires soaking tree bark in a river, it would probably be best for the workshop to be near the river, I think.”\n\n\n “Near the river, huh… that’ll be difficult. How are you doing it now?”\n\n\n Lutz shrugs. “Right now, we’re carrying all of our equipment to the river bank in the forest, but doing that every day is really hard… oh, um, difficult, sir.”\n\n\n “If you think about scaling things up for mass production,” I say, “then the equipment will need to be much bigger, so transporting it to the river will be next to impossible, I think? Well, thinking about that is probably a job for you, Mister Benno, or the people at the workshop.”\n\n\n “…Hmm, you’re right.”\n\n\n Since it looks like Benno has understood, I’ll just leave selecting a workshop and sourcing the tools to him.\n\n\n “Please take care of selecting a workshop, getting the equipment, and finding suppliers for the materials before our baptisms. As the actual day of the ceremony gets closer, Lutz will go and instruct the workers in the actual manufacturing process.”\n\n\n “Me?!”\n\n\n Lutz’s eyes go wide, and he gapes like a fish. I smile sweetly, giving him a big nod.\n\n\n “I mean, aren’t there steps that I can’t do myself? I think it would be best for you to show them how to do it in person. If after spending the entire spring doing it over and over you’re still uneasy about it, then I can go with you too, so you’ll be fine!”\n\n\n “You’re really passing the entire task off, aren’t you,” says Benno, with an amused chuckle.\n\n\n I glance guiltily to the side. I’m definitely well aware that I’m seriously shirking a lot of responsibility here. However, more than just making prototypes, improving distribution, and setting up mass production, I already want to be setting my sights on the next project. If I spend all my time fussing over the particulars of making paper, then I’ll never actually get to making books, no matter how much time I spend. This spring, I want to make enough paper for me to use, and then turn my attention towards printing.\n\n\n “Then, please excuse us.”\n\n\n With my heart full of my time-limited ambitions, I depart from Benno’s office.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, the fast-working Mark delivers new bamboo paper mats to our storehouse. Hearing that, Lutz takes the opportunity to check on the condition of the river when he heads to the forest for his gathering.\n\n\n “Lutz, how’d it look? You think we can make paper?”\n\n\n “There’s a little more water flowing than usual from all the snow thawing, but not more than we’d get after a heavy rain, I think.”\n\n\n And, with that judgement, we officially resume making paper. First thing in the morning on the following day, Lutz fetches the key, then we immediately head off for the storehouse. As we walk along the alleyways, still cold enough that you need a coat, I spend my time thinking about the day’s work.\n\n\n To start with, when we get to the warehouse, we’ll check to see if the outer bark we’d harvested from the tronbay back in the autumn and left out to dry is still alright. If it is, then we’ll start by working on stripping that down to its inner back. While that happens, I’d like to use the preserved folin inner bark to start making actual paper.\n\n\n “I’d really like it if we could wait for the water to get a little warmer, though…” I say.\n\n\n “Yeaaah, you’re right. But, if you keep in mind that we’re trying to save up money, the sooner we start the better.”\n\n\n Benno’s support for our paper-making enterprise is only going to last until the day of our baptismal ceremony. Until then, we want to do as much as we can to earn as much as possible.\n\n\n “I wonder if the tronbay bark’s going to be alright…?” I say, wondering aloud.\n\n\n “That’s been airing out this entire time, so it’s probably going to be completely dried out by now.”\n\n\n “It wasn’t drying in the sun, so I’ve been really worried about mold growing all over it!”\n\n\n Since we left it alone all winter, it’s only natural that it would have completely dried out by now, but whether or not it dried in a way that we actually want is another question entirely.\n\n\n “There aren’t really any molds that grow on tronbay,” says Lutz.\n\n\n He may be shrugging it off, but since we completely skipped the sun-drying part of the process altogether, I can’t help but worry.\n\n\n We arrive at the storehouse and unlock the door. With a creak, the door opens. Through the gloom and the dust, dark, wavy strips of material hang from the shelves like strands of seaweed, giving the entire place a supremely ominous air.\n\n\n “Is it really going to be okay?” I ask.\n\n\n “I think I’m a little worried now,” Lutz replies.\n\n\n I prod at a strip of outer bark, finding that it’s completely dried out. Since the outer bark itself is dark, I can’t really tell from the color alone whether or not it has mold growing on it.\n\n\n “How about we bring these to the forest and try soaking them in the river for now?” I mutter to myself.\n\n\n “What all are we going to bring to the forest today?” asks Lutz, sweeping dust off of the wooden box with back straps that he’d left in here.\n\n\n “Umm… Lutz, how about you bring the pot and some ash? And, hm, I don’t think we’ll need something as big as a tub, but maybe we should bring a bucket as well. It would be kinda bad if we couldn’t find any firewood in the forest, so maybe we should bring some with us? I’ll bring this outer bark and this preserved folin inner bark, and my 'chopsticks’, too.”\n\n\n “I don’t get why we need a bucket, but if you say we need it I’ll bring it.”\n\n\n I gather up the dried tronbay outer bark and the folin inner bark from where we’d hung it in the warehouse, fetch the pair of cooking chopsticks Lutz had made for me, grab a few dust rags, and put it all in a basket. The two of us strap our supplies onto our back, and rush off to where the other children are meeting to get ready to go to the forest.\n\n\n We all arrive at the forest, and as the other kids scatter about to go foraging, Lutz and I head for the riverbank. Lutz starts getting the pot ready right next to the river. He sets it down on a stove made of piled-up rocks, then uses the bucket to fill it up with river water.\n\n\n “Oh,” he says, “if we use this then we don’t have to get soaked when we get water from the river. I knew you had a good reason!”\n\n\n If you want to fill up the heavy pot with water directly from the river, then you’ve basically got no choice but to get in the river yourself. It seems like Lutz hadn’t quite been thinking ahead that far.\n\n\n Now that the pot’s full of water, we use the firewood that we brought to get a fire started. While we wait for the water to boil, I want to start soaking the outer bark in the river, if possible.\n\n\n “Wow, that looks cold,” mutters Lutz, staring at the river, swollen with water from melting snow.\n\n\n If we want to make sure that the bark doesn’t wash away as it soaks, we need to build a circle of rocks to put it in. The one that we had made during the fall, however, has fallen apart, and only about half of it remains. Our first step thus has to be building a new stone circle.\n\n\n “You can do it, Lutz!”\n\n\n “Eek! Cold!!”\n\n\n Lutz squawks as he wades into the river of ice water. If I were to go in myself, I’d almost certainly get another fever and my family would probably bar me from leaving the house for a while, so basically the only thing I can be doing to help is to cheer him on.\n\n\n For Lutz’s sake, I walk around the area, gathering up fallen firewood. While I’m in the middle of that, though, he calls out for me.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, bring the bark over!”\n\n\n “On it~!”\n\n\n As soon as the bark’s in the circle, Lutz leaps out of the river, running to the stove to warm himself up with the fire. He holds his bright-red hands up to the fire, rubbing them vigorously together. I fill up the bucket with some warm water from the pot, then set it down in front of him.\n\n\n “Put your hands and feet in here. If you don’t warm them up, you’ll get frostbite!”\n\n\n “…Ah, warm… this feels great!”\n\n\n He sticks his hands and feet into the bucket of warm water, heaving a sigh of relief. The hot water starts cooling down almost immediately, but thanks to that foot bath, it looks like his body’s warming up a bit.\n\n\n The pot has started gently simmering, so I add the ash and the white bark to it, stew it well, then get Lutz to put it in the river to rinse out the spare ash. Thanks to Lutz’s hard work, even if it did seem like the freezing river had him on the verge of tears, our job for today is finished."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The next day, we need to bring in the bark from the river and strip the dark outer bark down to the light inner bark, so we bring the board, pot, and bucket with us. Sitting by the fire (and, occasionally, dipping our hands in the hot water to warm up), we use our knives to strip down the bark.\n\n\n “I have to say it: I don’t want to be doing this when it’s not summer. My fingers are completely numb right now,” I say.\n\n\n “You can say that again,” replies Lutz. “Going into the river is awful.”\n\n\n As we grumble, we force ourselves to keep our hands steady, and work our way towards finishing up the tronbay inner bark. Even now that we’re stripping it down, I’m still not seeing any spots on it that look like it might be mold, so I let myself breathe a sigh of relief.\n\n\n “…Doesn’t look like any mold grew on it after all. I’m glad!”\n\n\n “I mean, the folin’s one thing, but didn’t I tell you that the tronbay was going to be okay?”\n\n\n “It’s a pretty dangerous plant, huh?”\n\n\n After we finish stripping the bark, we go foraging in the forest. Since it seems that there are a lot of medicinal plants that only grow during this season, Lutz and I go together, him teaching me as we go.\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz. Why aren’t we picking up this red fruit here? Is it poisonous?”\n\n\n I notice that Lutz avoids a fruit that hangs along our path as we walk past. It’s red, and about the size of the first knuckle of an adult’s thumb. I’d have to guess that this fruit is somehow dangerous. I point at it, careful not to touch it, and ask Lutz about it.\n\n\n “Ahh, it’s better to just leave tau fruit alone. Basically, all that’s in there is water. You can’t eat it, so if you bring it home all it does is dry out, so there’s not really any use for them right now.”\n\n\n “What do you mean, right now?”\n\n\n “Oh, in the summer, they grow about as big as your fist, and when they hit something, they explode and send water everywhere, so then we all chuck them at each other.”\n\n\n It seems like I should look at these as some sort of naturally-occurring water balloon. Since all it would do is wither if we brought it home, it seems like it would be best to leave it alone, otherwise it won’t grow any bigger.\n\n\n That’s a weird fruit.\n\n\n “All the kids and adults in the town come together and have a big fruit fight using these. Man, isn’t the Star Festival great?”\n\n\n I’ve been here at least a year, but I can’t recall anything about this particular festival at all.\n\n\n “…Hey, Lutz, I haven’t heard anything about this Star Festival, though? It sounds like some sort of summer festival… thing?”\n\n\n “Oh, around that time, you were basically dying, weren’t you? I wanted to invite you, but your mom said your fever wasn’t going down at all. I brought your bamboo strips around after that.”\n\n\n Ahh, around then, huh?\n\n\n Based on what he’s saying, I can figure out which time in particular I was in the process of dying. My mokkan got burned up, which prompted the first episode in which I can clearly remember feeling like I was being swallowed alive by the devouring. Since it seems like I was totally unconscious for quite a few days, and stuck in bed for a while after that, even if there was a festival, going to it would have been completely out of the question. I’d guess that my family didn’t go, either.\n\n\n “Tuuli probably wanted to go, but I guess she didn’t because of me, huh?”\n\n\n I might be robbing Tuuli of her opportunities to make happy childhood memories! I hang my head as I think about that, but Lutz just shrugs, shaking his head.\n\n\n “Nah, your mom stayed to keep an eye on you, so Tuuli got to participate. Ralph and I picked a lot of tau so that we could team up against her.”\n\n\n “Oh, really? That’s a relief.”\n\n\n “It would be great if you could make it out this year, Ma?ne!”\n\n\n “Yeah!”\n\n\n I promise him that I’ll keep an eye on my health so I can participate in the Star Festival, and we finish up our foraging. Even though I made that promise, however, I have no idea whether or not my parents would allow me to participate in a festival that involved chucking water balloons at each other.\n\n\n From the next day on, we work out of the warehouse. At this point it’s turned into work that we have to have warm water nearby to constantly warm up our hands in, but we get to work on making paper out of folin, using the new contract-sized bamboo paper mats. As we let that paper dry over the course of a few days, we start working on making paper out of the tronbay inner bark.\n\n\n “The folin paper’s pretty dry, now. I think it’s because today was super clear.”\n\n\n “The tronbay paper should be dry after tomorrow, maybe?”\n\n\n As I check on the manufacturing process, I take the twenty-six sheets of folin paper and split them evenly with Lutz. As he takes his thirteen sheets from me, he frowns, troubled.\n\n\n “Hey, Ma?ne. Why are you splitting it up here? Isn’t it just fine to split up the money after we’ve brought all of the paper to Master Benno?”\n\n\n “I mean, what I really want is the actual finished product. It would be wrong for me to keep paper that Benno bought us the materials for, it’s okay for me to keep the stuff that we made from materials we gathered ourselves, right?”\n\n\n If I were to sell paper to Benno and then buy it back, he’d take his 30% commission off the top. In that case, it’s better for me to just not sell it to him in the first place.\n\n\n “So you’re not going to sell any?”\n\n\n “I’ll sell just half of it. I’m gathering paper so that I can make a book!”\n\n\n Now that we’ve not just established the proper formula but have also started growing increasingly familiar with the actual manufacturing process, our success rate is starting to increase, meaning that we’re producing fewer and fewer failures. That makes my end goal of making a book more complicated. My mother has told me so many stories by now that recording all of them is going to be a huge task.\n\n\n After completing our work, we immediately head to Benno’s shop to bring him our finished paper, bringing the key to the warehouse along with us.\n\n\n “Oh, it’s done?”\n\n\n Benno takes the two stacks of folin paper from Lutz and I, then counts them. Lutz’s stack has thirteen sheets, and mine has six. He frowns, noticing the blatant difference in number.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you’ve got way less in here. Why’s that?”\n\n\n “Because what I ultimately want is the paper, I’ve kept some for myself. Of course, this wouldn’t be paper made from materials for which you paid, but from materials we gathered ourselves; that should be alright, is it not?”\n\n\n “…Hm, sure. I don’t particularly care about what you do with your own materials, but what exactly are you going to be using all that paper for?”\n\n\n He wears a slightly guarded expression as he asks me that question.\n\n\n “I’m going to be making a book. That’s why I want paper.”\n\n\n “A book? …Why’re you making one of those? To sell?”\n\n\n “Huh? I just want one to read myself, though…?”\n\n\n Benno and I exchange strange looks, collectively tilting our heads to the side. There’s no way that Benno, who can’t comprehend using such a high-value good as paper to make something not for sale, and I, who just wants a book and doesn’t actually care about the material value, could understand each other.\n\n\n “Well, whatever. Paper this size will sell for one large silver coin. My commission is thirty percent, so, how much is your share?”\n\n\n Lutz doesn’t really understand percentages yet. As he stammers, frantically trying to work out the math, I quickly respond with the correct answer.\n\n\n “Seven small silver coins, sir.”\n\n\n “What?!” yells Lutz. “Seven small silver coins?! Wh… th… that’s too much, isn’t it?!”\n\n\n Lutz, upon hearing a number so completely beyond his expectations, gapes at me in sheer shock.\n\n\n “…Lutz, calm down. I know it sounds like a lot of money for us to be earning, but we’re only going to be seeing profits for this until our baptismal ceremonies, you know? If you think about how much money Mister Benno is going to be making off of this paper from now on, this is really a pretty tiny amount, so don’t worry about it.”\n\n\n “Don’t worry about it? You…”\n\n\n I’d tried to calm him down, but his eyes start rolling around in his head in pure uncomprehending shock.\n\n\n “Since you’re selling thirteen sheets,” I say to him, “you’ll be getting nine large and one small silver coins. I’m selling six, so I’ll get four large and two small silver coins.”\n\n\n “Uh, when you say ‘nine large silver coins’ there’s no way I can hear that and think that’s a 'pretty tiny amount’, right?”\n\n\n “Hm? Then, should we reduce the selling price?”\n\n\n I incline my head slightly to the side in doubt, looking at Lutz as he seems to be paralyzed with fear, as I make my suggestion. However, Benno, still sitting in front of us, smiles at us wryly, shaking is head while he rejects our suggestion.\n\n\n “We can’t sell it for any lower. We’d just be creating needless strife with some people who have vested interests in the field. Let’s keep it at the same price for now. When this starts actually circulating around the market, I’ll start thinking about changing the selling price. Hey, if you’re scared of that much money, how about I increase my commission?”\n\n\n That last bit he aimed directly at Lutz, grinning broadly.\n\n\n “We don’t have any say in how much it gets sold for,” I say, “so we’ll leave determining the actual sale price to you, Mister Benno, but I won’t agree to any change to your commission. Hey, Lutz. If you don’t need that money, how about you give it to me?”\n\n\n “As if I’d give it to either of you!” he yells. “I was just a little shocked at how much money it was, that’s all!”\n\n\n Lutz clutches his guild card tightly to his chest. Since guild cards are bound to their owner by blood, it’s impossible for anyone but the actual owner to use them. It’s a perfectly safe place to keep your money.\n\n\n “If you store it with the guild, then you don’t have to look at the cash itself, so it’s not so scary, is it?”\n\n\n “Crap, I’m kinda jealous how weirdly shameless you are about all this, Ma?ne.”\n\n\n “Whoa, shameless?! That’s meaaan!”\n\n\n In my Urano days, I saved my money in the bank. Then, in this world, I’d earned entire small gold coins, and then spent basically all of them paying for that magic tool, so I guess I’m just pretty used to the movement of large sums of money by now. There’s no way I’m being shameless about it.\n\n\n As I sulk, I reach out to tap guild cards with a broadly grinning Benno, settling our accounts. I get five large copper coins in cash from him to bring back to my family. Lutz does the same, getting some coins for his family, and we finish up our transactions.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n A few days later, when Lutz goes to retrieve the key for the warehouse, he comes back carrying a letter and a fairly large package. More accurately, it’s not a letter, but a wooden board upon which an invitation has been written. In the package are a couple hooded coats, designed to be pulled on over the head like some kind of poncho.\n\n\n “What are these?” asks Lutz, frowning at his differently-colored poncho.\n\n\n I look over our written invitation. It succinctly lists the time, place, and reason for the meeting.\n\n\n “It says that we’re to meet in the central plaza at the fourth bell for the purpose of purchasing clothing,” I say.\n\n\n “Huh? Clothes?”\n\n\n “…It says that there are people who have come to voice objections to the paper we’ve made. While the sender of the invitation wants to meet with them to discuss a possible resolution, it seems that it would be best for us to not stand out so that our existence doesn’t become known. Since our appearances don’t blend in at the shop, we’re to wear these when we go to meet with the sender.”\n\n\n “Uh? What the heck is this?! This sounds really dangerous, right?”\n\n\n The two of us slip the ponchos on over our heads to try them on. They’re very warm, and cover our clothing entirely. For now, it seems that it’s best to cover up our raggedy clothing. When we raise the hoods, both our hair and our faces are hidden, so when we’re walking around we should keep them up. My hairpin, it seems, is very conspicuous.\n\n\n “I don’t know whether or not it’s actually dangerous, but since we’re going to be meeting Mister Mark, how about we make sure we bring in the tronbay paper beforehand so that we can sell it while we’re at it? Oh, although, maybe it would be better if we weren’t weren’t walking around with it when we were just told we shouldn’t stand out?”\n\n\n I start checking on the state of the tronbay paper, but Lutz suddenly gets really mad.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, why’re you so relaxed about this?!”\n\n\n “Huh? I mean, I basically already expected that a new product like this would run against someone else’s vested interests. I guess it’s a little sooner than I would have thought, though…”\n\n\n “'Vested interests’?”\n\n\n Lutz frowns, repeating the unfamiliar term.\n\n\n “Some person (or people) who already have rights to earn profits from something. Mister Benno mentioned it yesterday, you know? That if we lowered the prices we’d be creating strife. If I had to guess, this time it’s the people who make parchment.”\n\n\n “What do the parchment makers have to do with it? Our paper is made from wood, so they’re not related at all, right?”\n\n\n If you just look at the manufacturing process, they’re completely unrelated, but both the end use and the level of the clientele are exactly the same. Until now, there was nothing at all that could threaten the parchment makers’ profits, so the sudden appearance of a previously unknown kind of paper has probably sent them into a panic, I think.\n\n\n “Ummm, so, if nobody but them could make any sort of paper, then no matter how expensive they made it, everyone would still have no choice but to buy parchment if they wanted to write contracts, you know? But, if a new kind of paper showed up, then that new paper could steal some of their existing customers, see?”\n\n\n “Ahh, I guess you’re right.”\n\n\n Lutz nods, seeming to understand. If a new product that’s good for the same thing appears, then of course some customers would be drawn away towards the new thing.\n\n\n “If that’s the case, then they couldn’t take in the same proceeds, you know? And they wouldn’t like that. Plus, if we got to the point where we could sell a lot of paper, then the sale price would start going down, too.”\n\n\n “Huh, really?”\n\n\n I draw a graph on my slate. I mark two lines for the X and Y axes, then draw two intersecting curves as simple representations of supply and demand, and then start to explain their connection.\n\n\n “So, this graph shows how 'supply’ and 'demand’ are connected. This line’s the 'supply curve’, and this one’s the 'demand curve’. 'Supply’ is the amount of a good exists, and 'demand’ is the number of people wanting to buy it.”\n\n\n “Ahh,” he replies.\n\n\n “If there’s lots of people who want to buy a good, and there’s not enough of it on the market to sell, then the price of that good goes up.”\n\n\n As I explain the importance of the left side of the two curves, he seems to understand. “Ah, if there’s a shortage you can charge as much as you want,” he murmurs.\n\n\n “Then, as more of the good is able to be sold, then the people who want it can start buying it, and then you’re left with fewer people who want it, you know? So then, the price starts to go down.”\n\n\n As I explain, I slide my finger along the curves, until I reach the intersection point in the middle.\n\n\n “If there’s more goods available than people who want to buy it, then no matter how much of it you put out for sale you won’t actually be able to sell it, you know? In that case, then the price will just get lower and lower, right?”\n\n\n As I keep dragging my finger right, the supply and demand curve completely switch places on the Y-axis.\n\n\n “Do you get it? Just because of the fact that we’re able to make paper, prices are going to start dropping. Since the parchment makers aren’t going to want to reduce the price of parchment, and they want to maintain the same amount of profit that they had before, they had to voice objections over a new kind of paper entering the market.”\n\n\n “Hey, isn’t that really bad, though?” he asks, anxiously.\n\n\n I shake my head, smiling. “Since Mister Benno’s telling us to keep ourselves hidden, what he’s really saying is that it’s okay to leave taking these people on to him. It’ll be fine, don’t worry about it. …Although I don’t know exactly what’s going on since I haven’t been told about it in any detail.”\n\n\n By the time our meeting time comes around, we’re able to finish twenty-four sheets of tronbay paper, but since we’re waiting to see what the actual plan is, we leave it behind in the storehouse.\n\n\n “Lutz, put your hood up too, for now, so that way they won’t be able to recognize your face or your hair color.”\n\n\n The fact that Benno went as far as to send us clothes to wear means that there’s no way that there’s zero chance we might get caught up in something dangerous. As we nervously wait in the central plaza, the fourth bell rings, and Mark comes to meet us.\n\n\n “Thank you for waiting,” he says. “As promised, shall we go acquire the clothing you’ll need as apprentices?”\n\n\n “Yes please, Mister Mark.”\n\n\n Since I’m not going to become an apprentice, I don’t actually need the clothes, but if I’m going to be coming and going from Benno’s shop, then it might be a good idea for me to have clothing that won’t stand out. I contemplate whether or not this is actually a waste of money as we walk, leading Mark to mistakenly believe that I might not be in peak form and scoop me up into his arms.\n\n\n “I can walk on my own?!” I protest.\n\n\n “Ah; I had heard you moaning, so I had merely grown somewhat anxious. Please, for the sake of my own peace of mind, let me carry you.”\n\n\n “I was just thinking while I walked. There’s nothing wrong with my health!”\n\n\n His smile not faltering in the least, Mark speeds up his pace just a little bit. It seems like he’s of a mind to completely ignore any of my arguments.\n\n\n “Then, please feel free to think to your heart’s content.”\n\n\n “Luuutz!” I whine.\n\n\n “This’ll be way faster, so stay like that,” he says.\n\n\n With my plea for Lutz’s help struck down so firmly, I cease my struggling.\n\n\n Grr, why do I feel like I’m surrounded by my enemies!\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The three of us enter a clothing store, and the shopkeeper comes out to greet us with a smile. Both the employees and the clients here are all dressed sharply in elegant clothing. If Lutz and I had come to a store like this on our own, we’d have been shooed away immediately.\n\n\n “Oh my, if it isn’t Mister Mark? Welcome! Are these new apprentices?”\n\n\n “Yes, that’s right. I’d like to place an order for two sets of clothing, if you would.”\n\n\n This may be the shop that Mark buys all of the apprentices’ clothing from, as with just that brief request the shopkeeper smiles and nods.\n\n\n “Huh?” I say. “Two sets… is that one for me, too?”\n\n\n Lutz, of course, needs a set, but I’m certainly not becoming an apprentice. However, Mark simply nods, his smile as polite and constant as ever.\n\n\n “When you come and go from the shop looking like you do now, no matter what you do you wind up standing out. I’m terribly sorry, but I’ll still be having clothing prepared for you as well. Even if you won’t be working as an apprentice, you will still be visiting our shop, so I think it will be handy for you to have at least one set of clothes for yourself.”\n\n\n “…You’re right, I guess.”\n\n\n I’m not going to be an apprentice, but since I’m going to be working on developing new goods and am going to need to consult with Benno about both my earnings as well as whatever work he gives me to do at home, it’s likely that the frequency with which I visit the shop won’t actually change much from where we are now. Even worse, next to Lutz’s pristine apprentices’ garb, my worn-out clothes will just look all the more pitiful. Since I have some cash to spare right now, it might indeed be best for me to have some clothes made.\n\n\n Lutz is pulled deeper into the shop ahead of me, stripped down to his underwear, and measured all over. I’m pulled into a different room, and stripped down as well. Even just after having all sorts of measurements taken here and there, I’m left extremely worn out.\n\n\n “The advance fee will be one small silver coin.”\n\n\n “Alright,” I reply.\n\n\n We order everything apprentices need to wear, from top to bottom, including shoes, then use our guild cards to pay them one small silver coin. Just like Benno had said, the final total will be a little less than ten small silver coins. With that, it seems we’ll have a complete set of apprentices’ clothes.\n\n\n After we finish our clothing order, Mark leads us to Benno’s shop. There, we find Benno staring at our paper with a bit of a glare, but when he sees the two of us, his expression softens.\n\n\n “Ah, you’re here? It looks like things have gotten somewhat bothersome, so I’m being vigilant, even if I wonder if I might be going a little overboard. You two, be as vigilant as you can, too. Don’t let your guard down. These people could be anywhere, and I have no idea what they’ll do now that their interests are at stake.”\n\n\n It seems like Benno’s being a little overcautious, but he just tells us not to be unprepared for people whose interests we’re affecting. Since the two of us are still unbaptized children, he adds, if we’re wearing apprentices’ clothes, then he thinks we shouldn’t draw anyone’s attention, even if we’re loitering around the shop.\n\n\n “You’d written 'vested interests’ on that board; so is this the parchment makers, then?”\n\n\n “That’s right. The parchment makers’ association has filed a complaint with the merchant’s guild, it seems.”\n\n\n “With the merchant’s guild?”\n\n\n I tilt my head to one side, not exactly certain what the relation between the parchment makers’ association and the merchant’s guild could be. Benno gives a simple explanation of how the guild’s jobs includes protecting vested interests, resolving strife caused by new enterprises, and mediating disputes.\n\n\n “It seems that the complaint they lodged last evening was that there’s someone making paper who wasn’t a member of the parchment makers’ association and wasn’t paying them their dues. They contacted me, demanding to manage our activities, saying we’re outlaws arbitrarily doing things of our own accord.”\n\n\n “Huh,” I say, “and then?”\n\n\n There’s no way that Benno would just quietly lie down and give up. He’d probably try to find some point of compromise. When I, completely unconcerned, prompt him to continue, a triumphant, predatory smile spreads across his face.\n\n\n “I immediately refused. I told them that since this isn’t paper made from animal skin, the parchment makers’ association has nothing to do with it, and that they should get out of my face.”\n\n\n The blood drains from my face when I see how excessively belligerent Benno’s being. If he could find some sort of compromise, then he wouldn’t have to fight with them over sales at all, would he?\n\n\n “Huh? Ummm, so you didn’t try to compromise or negotiate, then?”\n\n\n “Idiot. If I start acting all modest from the beginning, they’re not going to take me seriously, you know? The reality of it is that we’re not stealing any of their manufacturing methods, so they can’t charge us any sort of technical fee. There’s no way you can make plant-based paper using a process designed for making paper out of animal skin, so there’s no real hierarchy here. What these guys really want to do is have a monopoly on everything paper-related at all and, if they can, steal our profits for themselves.”\n\n\n It looks like I’ve got my way of doing things and Benno’s got his, so even if I try to object it looks like nothing will come of it, but I wonder if there’s a way we could handle things a bit more peaceably?\n\n\n “Ummm, I think that since parchment’s made of paper, they won’t be able to suddenly increase their production. If the guild’s going to be intermediating, then perhaps they could restrict the kind of paper they could use for official contracts to parchment only? If you’d agree to that, then they’d still mostly keep their existing market and their existing products; how about that?”\n\n\n “You’re as soft as ever, kid.”\n\n\n Benno snorts derisively. I wonder if he thinks that guaranteeing them their existing clientele and profits by letting all official contracts be written on parchment would just be quietly rolling over? I wonder if this might just not work.\n\n\n “I just don’t like doing pointless things,” I say. “Besides, what I really want is to increase the circulation of paper so that lots of people can do new things with it. I want to see books, notepads, paintings, paper art… I want it to be something that people will even let kids use.”\n\n\n “That’s… a much grander dream than I expected,” he murmurs, his eyes open with amazement.\n\n\n “Huh? You think it’s grand? I’ve been thinking that if we could just make a lot of paper, then we could make it happen. That’s why I think that if we want to be bold and sell folin paper at a way lower price than parchment, then as long as people are using it for things besides writing contracts, then it should be fine, shouldn’t it? For instance, look at that report. If that was written on paper, then it would be easier to carry, and easier to store, too. And it’s way easier to write on than boards…”\n\n\n “I see, you want to differentiate the use of different kinds of paper, huh… I’ll try proposing that.”\n\n\n This time he doesn’t tell me that I’m being soft, but instead gives me a scheming sort of smile. It seems like I might have actually tickled the profit-seeking center of his brain.\n\n\n “If we’re differentiating between kinds of paper,” I continue, “then how about we treat tronbay paper as a high-grade good? To be honest, I think it’s a much higher-quality product than parchment.”\n\n\n “You’re right. I’ve already been planning on selling it at a much higher price than parchment.”\n\n\n “Huh? Much higher?”\n\n\n I look at him with wide eyes, wondering if he might have misspoken. Benno, on the other hand, narrows his eyes, looking back and forth between me and Lutz, scrutinizing us.\n\n\n “…Did the two of you just not notice?”\n\n\n “Huh? Notice… what?”\n\n\n “Lutz, what are the special properties of tronbay?”\n\n\n Lutz jumps, startled by the sudden question, then starts listing off the various characteristics of tronbay as they come to mind.\n\n\n “Huh? Properties? Well, it sucks up all of the nutrients from the surrounding soil, it grows really quickly, it’s hard to burn—”\n\n\n “Ah!” I interject, “is that it! …Is paper made from tronbay hard to burn?”\n\n\n Come to think of it, my father said that furniture made from tronbay is fire resistant, to the point where it’s often left standing after a big fire. The young, soft wood isn’t useful for making furniture, he said, so we made paper out of it.\n\n\n “Yeah, that’s right. Compared to ordinary paper, it’s extremely hard to burn. Of course, it isn’t completely impossible to burn it, but it’s still an excellent paper for writing national secrets or national public records. Something like a hard-to-burn paper will sell for a very high price indeed.”\n\n\n That’s certainly a special kind of paper, so of course it would sell for a high price. Even in Japan, it’s not like all kinds of paper cost the same. If it took a lot of labor to make, if it’s made out of something rare, or if it’s otherwise somehow special, then a single sheet could sell for an astonishingly high price indeed.\n\n\n “I understand,” I say. “…Then, how much would a sheet of tronbay paper sell for?”\n\n\n “For a contract-sized sheet, I’ll be selling them for five large silver coins each.”\n\n\n “Whoa…”\n\n\n The enormously huge price he’s assigned to it gives me a sudden headache, while Lutz is so shocked that he can’t even say anything, but Benno merely says, as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world, that “it’s a fire-resistant paper made from a hard-to-find material, that’s why.”\n\n\n “So, then,” he says, “until negotiations with the parchment makers’ association have finished, don’t show your face around the shop for a while. I’ve got a good reason for why I don’t want you two to be seen. Specifically, if your paper-making method were to leak and start spreading around, we’re going to start seeing corpses.”\n\n\n “Uh.”\n\n\n I stand there, blinking, shocked by how quickly the conversation turned grim. Benno then starts reminding me of some things about the contract magic that I’d completely forgotten about.\n\n\n “According to our magical contract, the individual who decides who can manufacture paper is you, Ma?ne, and the individual who determines who can sell it is you, Lutz. If someone who doesn’t know anything about this contract tries making or selling paper on their own, I have no idea what might wind up happening.”\n\n\n “Whaaat?! Contract magic is that dangerous?! It even affects people who don’t know anything about it?”\n\n\n This completely unforeseen development has me reeling. I hadn’t even considered that the magical contract that guaranteed us safe employment would have such an incredibly dangerous function to it.\n\n\n “It’s meant to guarantee the rights of people who deal with the nobility, right? Even if the person who violates it has no knowledge about the contract at all, some kind of punishment will still be handed down. That’s why I want to keep your existences a secret, declare to the merchant’s guild that I have a magical contract saying that my shop makes and sells the paper, and thus keep the parchment makers’ association in check.”\n\n\n Perhaps I shouldn’t be calling this magical contract something that secures our employment, but something that puts us in incredible danger. It declares that I hold the sole right to determine who is able to make plant-based paper and Lutz holds the sole right to sell it, and that, in reality, puts us in a really dangerous situation, doesn’t it?\n\n\n “I’d like to keep it a secret that you two are the ones who control who can sell it. I’ll leave the key to the storehouse with you, so don’t come around here for a while. When I’m done with my negotiations, I’ll contact you through Otto.”\n\n\n Benno, appearing as trustworthy as ever, says this to us, and Lutz and I nod in agreement."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Thanks to the magical contract I signed, wishing for a stable future, people might start dying.\n\n\n Benno’s words have me terrified. There’s no way I would have wanted to put other people in harms way just so that Lutz and I could secure our future employment. Trembling and shivering, I walk home with Lutz. There’s a pit in my stomach, like I’d swallowed a chunk of lead, and it churns within me.\n\n\n “You don’t have to worry so much,” says Lutz. “It’ll be okay. Master Benno’s taking care of it.”\n\n\n I nod at Lutz as he tries to reassure me, but after I get home, I start thinking about how people I might not know might start dying and how we might face some kind of punishment, and all I can do is worry and worry. My stomach ties itself in a knot.\n\n\n If you were to ask me what’s so scary, it’s dragging completely unknowing outsiders into this.\n\n\n What I really want to do is lock myself in my house, but Lutz practically drags me out of the house, telling me that staring blankly at the wall made me look like I was thinking some strange thoughts. We keep working on making paper and keep going to the forest, but apart from that the only thing we can do is wait to hear back from Benno. However, even after a few days, no matter how many times we’ve passed through the gates on our way to and from the forest, we haven’t heard a single thing from Otto. I haven’t heard anyone talking about any mysterious deaths, either. Everything seems to be basically the same as it always has been.\n\n\n As even more time passes, my fear starts to be replaced by suspicion. Would people really start turning up dead? Couldn’t Benno have just been exaggerating? Thinking along those lines, I try to recall exactly what he said, and what his facial expression and attitude had been like.\n\n\n “…If you think about it, it’s kinda weird, right?” I say.\n\n\n “What is?” replies Lutz, furrowing his eyebrows. He peels a fresh, wet sheet of paper off of the bamboo mat and spreads it out on the paper bed.\n\n\n “The fact that contract magic can affect people who don’t know about it,” I remind him.\n\n\n “Why?” he replies, in a casual tone of voice. “It’s magic, isn’t it supposed to be mysterious?” He finishes laying down his sheet of paper, and I start working on mine.\n\n\n “I think it’s kinda weird that magic is supposed to be mysterious. Or, rather, what if someone writes contract magic about some basic technique or some wide-spread commodity? Wouldn’t there be fallout from that everywhere? And if it was used in a faraway city, then there’s no way we’d ever hear about it in this city, too…”\n\n\n “Huh, I guess you’re right.”\n\n\n I continue thinking about it as I spread pulp over my paper mat. If contract magic were used as some kind of patent enforcement system, then that means there would need to be some kind of patent office controlling it. It would be dangerous to the public if nobody knew whether or not a particular product was protected by contract magic.\n\n\n “And, because we don’t know about it, I’m thinking that there have to be limits to the range or the effects of contract magic. Besides, wouldn’t there be much stricter protection in place around the use of such a dangerous kind of magic?”\n\n\n “You’re kind of talking in circles around it, but, really, you’re anxious, aren’t you?”\n\n\n “Anxious…”\n\n\n I unintentionally freeze up when he says that. Lutz, sitting next to me, takes the bamboo mat from me and keeps working.\n\n\n “When you’re trying to hide what you’re really feeling from yourself, you always start talking a lot,” he says. He lifts his chin a tiny bit, then urges me on, saying, “if you keep it all down I won’t understand any of it, so just spit it all out already.”\n\n\n “…I’m scared that people who don’t know about our magic contract might get put into danger. I want to think that Mister Benno was joking or even lying to us. Like, nobody’s in danger right now, right? He just wanted to scare us, right? …That’s what I want to be thinking.”\n\n\n “Well, if he is joking, what’s the point? What does he get out of deceiving us?”\n\n\n “Urgh… I, I mean, before now he’s deceived us a lot. I’m thinking that maybe he’s trying to cheat us, or maybe he’s keeping secrets, or maybe this is some kind of test.”\n\n\n As I wonder aloud why Benno could be trying to keep us away, I suddenly hear a very familiar voice come from behind me.\n\n\n “Hm? You mean to tell me you don’t trust Benno, Ma?ne?”\n\n\n Having thought that there was nobody else in the workshop but the two of us, Lutz and I instantly snap our heads around to see who we had just heard.\n\n\n “Mister Otto?!”\n\n\n “Why’re you here?!”\n\n\n Otto waves at us, eyebrows raised in an expression of mild surprise. He’s dressed in civilian clothes.\n\n\n “I’m here to deliver a message from Benno, remember?”\n\n\n “A message?!”\n\n\n Certainly, Benno had said that he’d contact us through Otto, but I’d thought that would have involved flagging us down when we passed through the gates. I certainly didn’t think he’d just show up at our storehouse like this.\n\n\n “It’s finally done, he said.”\n\n\n Such a simple message doesn’t tell me anything. I, who suffered through a constantly churning stomach as the result of a lack of information, immediately jump on him, pressing for details.\n\n\n “What’s finally done? How’d it get done?!”\n\n\n “It seems there were some difficulties with it.”\n\n\n “Some difficulties? What happened?!”\n\n\n Otto merely shrugs, refusing to give any sort of answer that actually answered anything. I have no idea if he actually doesn’t know what’s happening or if he’s merely pretending not to.\n\n\n “Benno didn’t explain anything to you?” he asks.\n\n\n “He didn’t tell me much. I know that if people who don’t know about our magic contract make or sell paper on their own then something bad will happen, and that he doesn’t want us to come around the shop until he’s done with his negotiations with the parchment makers’ association, since he wants to keep our manufacturing methods hidden. That’s all.”\n\n\n As I explain what little Benno had told me, Otto gently strokes his chin.\n\n\n “Hmm, so he’s told you the barest minimum amount for now, hasn’t he?”\n\n\n “Our contract hasn’t done any damage to any unknown people, has it? That’s the thing I’m most worried about…”\n\n\n “He kept your manufacturing methods hidden so that wouldn’t happen, didn’t he? There really hasn’t been any damage. Anything more than that you should probably ask Benno about. When you get to a good stopping point, how about we go there together?”\n\n\n “Okay!”\n\n\n Hearing that nobody’s been hurt takes an enormous weight off my chest. With my body suddenly feeling much lighter, I diligently go back to spreading pulp over the paper frame.\n\n\n “Ah, so is this how you make paper? What’s this thing here?”\n\n\n “A trade secret.”\n\n\n “This syrupy sort of goo, what’s it made of?”\n\n\n “Trade secrets.”\n\n\n Even though Otto seems very interested in how paper actually gets made, I refuse to answer any of his many questions as I continue my work.\n\n\n “We’ve got a great working relationship, Ma?ne. It’s alright to tell me about this stuff, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “Mister Benno will get mad at me if I start carelessly telling you everything. Right, Lutz?”\n\n\n I pass the conversation on to Lutz, who smiles, shrugging.\n\n\n “Right, because you never think, you always just start talking. You should probably keep your mouth shut.”\n\n\n “Ahaha…,” chuckles Otto. “Talking without thinking? I can imagine how thick the vein popping out of his forehead gets when that happens.”\n\n\n “Oh, his veins don’t pop out that often. He usually just gets really, really shocked.”\n\n\n After we tidy up our tools, the three of us head towards Benno’s shop. As we walk through the alleys, Otto, faster than we are, pulls ahead. He stops, then looks down at me, rubbing his temples.\n\n\n “…Do you usually walk this slowly?”\n\n\n “…Yes…?”\n\n\n “Whoa, you’re amazing, Lutz. You’re way more patient than I am. I respect that! …Anyhow, pardon me.”\n\n\n “Whoa!”\n\n\n Otto, confessing his own impatience, abruptly picks me up, then starts walking briskly forward. Now that I think about it, recently, both Benno and Mark have insisted on carrying me every time. It seems that, somehow, my walking speed is so slow that adults can’t help but feel like they absolutely have to carry me around. This is kind of a shock.\n\n\n When we arrive at Benno’s shop, Mark comes out to greet us.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, Lutz, good afternoon. Master Otto, you have my deepest gratitude for everything you have done for us.” He bows to Otto.\n\n\n “It wasn’t a big deal,” replies Otto, offhandedly. “It was actually pretty fun! Is Benno in?”\n\n\n He immediately heads inside. Still holding me in one hand, he uses his other hand to push open the door to the back room.\n\n\n “Benno, the water goddess has arrived!”\n\n\n The instant Otto enters, saying something strange, Benno immediately shoots him a glare, a bloodthirsty gleam in his eyes. The sheer intensity of Benno’s glare is such that I, still carried in Otto’s arms, am hit by the shockwave.\n\n\n “Shut up, Otto. You don’t want Corinna to divorce you, do you?”\n\n\n It seems that Benno, as Corinna’s substitute father, might have the authority to force the two of them to get a divorce. Otto’s basically his son-in-law, then, so it seems Benno’s something like the head of the family.\n\n\n I’m not the only one who puts Benno’s sharp glare and his low growl together and realizes how serious he really is. Otto, who’s built his entire life revolving around Corinna, frantically starts apologizing.\n\n\n “Whoa! No way! That was a little joke, you know?!”\n\n\n “It’s not a joke if it’s not actually funny.”\n\n\n Benno, wearing an expression such that I can’t quite tell if he’s joking or serious, starts reaching out as if to crush Otto’s skull. I, suddenly scared of being dropped, would like this to stop.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, what seems to have you in such a bad mood?”\n\n\n “It’s this asshole’s fault.”\n\n\n Although Benno scowls at him, Otto doesn’t seem to act like he cares that much as he sets me down on the floor.\n\n\n “Benno,” he says, “looks like Ma?ne doesn’t trust you! I caught her grumbling about you a little while ago. She was worried you might be deceiving her, keeping secrets from her, or even testing her, she said.”\n\n\n I’m pretty sure he knows exactly how angry Benno is. He’s absolutely saying something unnecessary right now. I have no doubt that he’s saying these things because Benno’s mad.\n\n\n “Mister Otto,” I object, “don’t say that!”\n\n\n I’m positive that Otto’s words will only make Benno’s mood worse, so I worriedly look over to see how Benno’s reacting. However, instead of seeming any angrier, Benno just looks down at me, then lets out an exhausted sigh.\n\n\n “Haahhh… are you getting too perceptive? Or maybe just too doubtful? Or maybe you just have a bad personality? I’ve been doing all of this hard, pain-in-the-ass work for you, and all I needed you to do was to just stay away and be quiet, and still…”\n\n\n “But,” interjects Otto, “not just blindly swallowing whatever someone tells you is a very important skill for a merchant to have, so trying to figure out the real meaning behind their words and actions is the right thing to do!”\n\n\n He gives me a big grin and a thumbs-up.\n\n\n “Well, whatever,” says Benno. “I’ll answer your questions. Sit.”\n\n\n We sit down at our usual table, facing each other and, with the very first words out of my mouth, I ask Benno about the thing that I’m most worried about.\n\n\n “Can contract magic really affect uninvolved people?”\n\n\n “Based on what’s written in it, yeah, it’s happened before. This time, if we’re not careful, it could happen again. I explained this to you already, right?”\n\n\n Certainly, he had said that. He’d explained it, but I just hadn’t accepted it.\n\n\n “But, if it were used for some basic craft, or some product or technique that’s already wide-spread, wouldn’t there be all sorts of damage everywhere? If someone were to write a magic contract in some far-off country, then we’d have no way of knowing about it at all… there’s got to be some sort of limit on its effects, or a maximum range, isn’t there? Also, shouldn’t there be some sort of control on the use of magic contracts, or something like that…”\n\n\n Benno nods, looking slightly amazed as I lay out my thoughts.\n\n\n “Yeah, magic contracts only really work in the city they were signed in. Small-scale magics that happen inside the city can’t make it out of the magical barrier built into the walls around it.”\n\n\n “Magical barrier?! Whoa, what’s that?!”\n\n\n The mention of a previously-unheard fantasy setting term sets my heart alight, and I instinctively lean forward and start asking for more information, but all I earn is another glare from Benno.\n\n\n “It’s the foundation of a town, but that doesn’t matter right now. So, are we all done with questions and explanations for today?”\n\n\n “Ahh, no, wait! So if contract magic can affect people who don’t know about it, then that’s really dangerous, isn’t it? It’s weird to just be able to casually use it for whatever, isn’t it?”\n\n\n Benno raises one eyebrow, looking a little uncomfortable, and stares at me.\n\n\n “No, you can’t just ‘casually use it for whatever’. The magical tools you need for it are given only to specifically approved merchants, and they’re so expensive your eyes would pop out of your head if I told you. And also, like you thought, contracts that can affect people besides the signatories absolutely must be declared to the lord of the land. If any damage were to happen without us declaring it, then we’d be the ones who get punished.”\n\n\n “Huh? Then…”\n\n\n The instant I start to panic about forgetting to declare the contract and damage happening, Benno flicks my forehead.\n\n\n “Gyah!”\n\n\n “Don’t misunderstand. I told the lord of the land about this a long time ago.”\n\n\n He guessed what I was going to say before I could even open my mouth. As I groan, rubbing my forehead, Benno snorts, the corners of his mouth turning up in a triumphant grin.\n\n\n “And, when I declared the contract, I was told that I needed to inform the merchant’s guild that I had signed a magical contract relating to a new commodity, and register it with them.”\n\n\n “…So in other words, you declared it to the guild as well?”\n\n\n “Of course I went! I declared it and registered it. Then, I went to get approval to start a new trade association.”\n\n\n “What?”\n\n\n Start a new trade association? What does he plan to do? Isn’t he doing something incredibly over-the-top?\n\n\n Hearing those unexpected words, my eyes widen in surprise and I tilt my head to one side. Seeing this, Benno puffs up his chest, looking extremely self-satisfied.\n\n\n “Plant-based paper is something that could turn into an enormous enterprise, right? So, I went to start a papermakers’ association, like the parchment makers’ association, so I can spread my business wide, even to other cities.”\n\n\n “…This is news to me, though?”\n\n\n Stunned, my face freezes. Benno nods emphatically.\n\n\n “It’s the first time I’m telling you.”\n\n\n “W… wait a minute. So that means, you were planning on competing with the parchment makers right from the beginning weren’t you?! You never wanted to have a peaceful talk with them at all!”\n\n\n Why he’d race straight towards such a stubborn conclusion, I have no idea. I can’t see any room for laying any groundwork, making concessions, or finding any points of compromise anywhere in there.\n\n\n “It’s not my fault that it didn’t end nice and quietly. It’s that old bastard’s fault.”\n\n\n “Are you just shifting the blame?” I reply.\n\n\n As Benno glares at me, growling, Otto, sitting next to him, starts laughing uproariously, clutching his sides. I have no idea just how that got set off, but Benno and I just glance at him, mutually deciding to leave him alone.\n\n\n “I’m not shifting the blame. I went to the merchant’s guild to get everything declared, but because I didn’t have any of the actual product on hand when the contract was signed, I was told that I couldn’t actually register it. So, when the prototype was finished, I went again to go register it.”\n\n\n “Ah…”\n\n\n “But, the guild master decided he didn’t like the idea of me registering a new trade association, so he gave me this long-winded speech, and then even though I got my application in, it seems like it’s still not done being processed, even though the seasons have already changed entirely.”\n\n\n Come to think of it, back when Lutz and I went to get our temporary registrations, the guild master interfered with that too. He eventually allowed us to be registered, since he wanted to be able to do business with me for a hairpin, but I remember him being extremely reluctant about that.\n\n\n “That happened before, when Lutz and I needed temporary registrations, but could the guild master hold back your registration or reject it for totally personal reasons?”\n\n\n “If he could come up with some plausible pretext for it. Remember, when we got you registered, his reason was that you weren’t my blood relatives, right? This time, he said he felt like the parchment makers’ association already was a paper organization, so there wasn’t a need to make another association solely for plant-based paper.”\n\n\n Judging by the deeply unpleasant expression on Benno’s face, he must be reliving the mood he’d been in during his meeting with the guild master. I feel like it must have been a dangerous struggle, with the guild master constantly finding fault with him.\n\n\n “I can imagine how that discussion went,” I say.\n\n\n “I’d filed my application back in the autumn, so I started selling paper now thinking that there’s no way I still wouldn’t actually be registered. It’s obvious that I wasn’t cautious enough, but do you really think I’m shifting the blame here?”\n\n\n He glares at me, and I frantically shake my head.\n\n\n “Ummm, no, I think it’s the guild master’s fault for procrastinating.”\n\n\n “That’s right. So, when I sold paper without that registration, then the parchment makers’ guild went to lodge a complaint. But that old bastard played it totally innocent, and then he even started by siding entirely with the other guys…”\n\n\n It’s looking more and more like Benno’s rival isn’t actually the parchment makers’ association. It’s the guild master.\n\n\n “So, the magic contract still isn’t done being registered, even though the lord of the land himself told me to go do it. If something bad were to happen to some unknown person because of that, then what do you think would happen?”\n\n\n Failing to register after being explicitly told to would either leave an extremely bad impression or be treated as an outright felony, I think.\n\n\n “I think the lord of the land would get very angry,” I say.\n\n\n “Yeah. He’d confiscate my tools for making magical contracts, and then, he’d restrict all of my dealings with the nobility, and then he’d punish all of the signatories. If that happens, I think that would probably be that old bastard’s best possible outcome! So, until registration finished, there was no way we could let anyone know about how your paper-making methodology worked.”\n\n\n “Ah, I see…”\n\n\n Now that I know how vigilant Benno’s trying to be against the guild master, I can understand how strict he was being.\n\n\n “However, there’s no way I could get the two of you tangled up in the enormous pain in the ass that is a negotiation between adults, right? Especially you, Ma?ne, since you don’t pay any attention to your actual surroundings, and then just because some acquaintance saves your life, you just start carelessly blathering on about all sorts of sensitive information.”\n\n\n “Whaaat?! You trust me that little?!”\n\n\n “There’s an abundance of evidence. Reflect on your own actions a little.”\n\n\n “Ngh…”\n\n\n Reminded of the various things I’d wound up doing at the guild master’s house, I can’t come up with any retort. Certainly, from Benno’s standpoint, he has no idea what I might wind up doing, so keeping me isolated is the best course of action.\n\n\n “I think I understand the gist of it,” I say. “So, were the negotiations with the parchment makers’ association very difficult?”\n\n\n “That was all just making the necessary arrangements, so that wasn’t particularly difficult. No, the only bothersome part of that was dealing with that old bastard.”\n\n\n The guild master really is the last boss, huh? I never thought that Benno would be treating the parchment makers as trash mobs. This is a development I hadn’t even considered, back when I was making paper with a huge knot in my stomach.\n\n\n Otto, who had been quietly listening to our conversation, grins broadly, then opens his mouth to speak.\n\n\n “I was taken along to that meeting. We worked out an agreement on a compromise plan.”\n\n\n “Compromise plan?”\n\n\n “The one where we’d distinguish kinds of paper based on usage,” says Benno.\n\n\n “Ahh…”\n\n\n Benno’s words reminds me of the fact that I’d suggested it to begin with, and I clap my hands. With that compromise, we’d be able to distribute paper far and wide while preserving, for now, the parchment makers’ market territory. This is a big step forward for my book-making project, isn’t it? As paper becomes more widespread, the price will drop, and just through that alone books will become way easier to make.\n\n\n It looks like I finally don’t have to worry about paper anymore when it comes to making books.\n\n\n Once Benno establishes a workshop for mass production, all my paper-related worries will disappear. My next issue will be finding ink, and then printing… and as my thoughts take off into the clouds, even Otto looks like he’s somehow enjoying himself.\n\n\n “And now everyone’s shocked! Who’s this guy, and what did he do with that totally uncompromising Benno we know?! So now there’s this rumor going around that the water goddess came to visit him.”\n\n\n “The water goddess?” asks Lutz, speaking up now that the conversation has digressed from the troublesome tales of the meeting and the mood of the room has softened somewhat.\n\n\n “The springtime herald of the melting snow,” explains Otto. “The goddess who brings an end to the long winter.”\n\n\n Otto’s words snap me back to my senses. Now that I think about it, I really don’t know any of the mythology of this world at all. I already found one mention of a god in the new year’s greeting, so it’s likely that there’s more of them hiding around in day-to-day life around here.\n\n\n “…This water goddess, is she different from the goddess of spring that we talk about in the new year’s greeting?”\n\n\n “Different, hmm… well, the goddess of melted snow, the goddess of new buds, and all of the other spring-related goddesses are all called goddesses of spring, you know?”\n\n\n “Huh…”\n\n\n Is it just me, or does calling it “polytheism” make it sound a little more relatable? At least, this doesn’t look like a world where I’d be forced into the same kind of monotheism that I was kind of coerced into in my Urano days. I’m feeling a little less anxious about my baptism, now.\n\n\n “…That’s it?” says Otto, looking blankly at me. It seems that, after he took the effort to explain all of that to me, responding with a single “huh…” might have been a little rude.\n\n\n “Hm? Oh, umm… I’m happy to know a little more about the goddesses now. I’ll be sure to ask you more about the gods next time!”\n\n\n “Oh, that’s not what I meant, O wa—”\n\n\n “Otto, do you want to be kicked out?” growls Benno, giving him an extremely irritated look.\n\n\n I have a feeling that my incorrect guess might have somehow been the cause, but I can’t really tell how just from seeing Benno’s angry expression, and I’m still pretty sure I was correct.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, now that I think about it, why did you bring Mister Otto to the meeting?”\n\n\n I toss Otto a lifeline in order to stop Benno from talking about how he was going to kick him out of the family, and it seems like I successfully manage to shift Benno’s attention to me. He quickly lets go of Otto and turns to me. Otto gives me an extremely thankful look.\n\n\n “When the paper makers’ association gets off of the ground, I plan to have him help me with it.”\n\n\n “Oh? Wait, then, you mean Mister Otto will get to be a merchant?!”\n\n\n Has the day come where Otto, who had abandoned the life of a merchant so that he could marry Corinna, could finally become one again? As I think that happy thought, though, Benno shakes his head at me.\n\n\n “No, Otto’ll be a soldier til the bitter end. I’m just using him in his free time.”\n\n\n “Whaaaat?! That’s really mean, isn’t it?!”\n\n\n To have to work all day as a soldier, and then be used by Benno as a merchant when his soldier’s work is done, that really is a pitiable state to be in. Lutz, sitting next to me, nods in agreement. However, Benno just snorts, then looks at Otto with a cruel grin.\n\n\n “Oh, it’s only natural that he work to pay me his share of the rent. For Corinna’s sake. Right, Otto?”\n\n\n “I think I’d be earning a little more than just rent money, though?”\n\n\n The two of them stare at each other with dark smiles, now completely ignoring me and Lutz. I have no idea how long it’ll take for them to be finished with this staring contest, so I tap lightly on the table.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, I’ve got a follow-up question. What eventually happened with the guild master?”\n\n\n Benno turns his gaze away from Otto and focuses on me. He shrugs his shoulders, then grins triumphantly.\n\n\n “Since we found some common ground, the parchment makers’ association agreed to the creation of a paper makers’ association, so the guild leader reluctantly approved of it too.”\n\n\n “He was forced to approve of it, you mean?” interjects Otto.\n\n\n Otto’s phrasing is probably a little more accurate, I think. Lutz and I nod in understanding. Seeing this, Benno clucks his tongue at us.\n\n\n “I’ve filled out every necessary form exactly, I’ve negotiated everything with the parchment makers’ association, and I’ve done so with nobody getting injured. The fact that everything’s being dragged out so long, even with all that, is entirely because the guild master is dragging his feet.”\n\n\n “Yeah, that’s about right,” says Otto. “But, maybe, you might not have needed to say things like 'if you’re so senile that you can’t read paperwork anymore then you should just retire already’ or 'how about you just let me do it if you are so damned inclined’? Just a thought.”\n\n\n I squeak as my breath catches in my throat.\n\n\n “It’s because you say things like that!” I say. “If you’re being that… brazen, then of course things are going to get difficult! You made the guild master mad, didn’t you?”\n\n\n “Oh, his face was bright red, he was so mad.” says Otto. “I didn’t think a person’s face could even get that red!”\n\n\n Otto is talking like this is somehow kinda funny, but this is absolutely not a laughing matter. Benno adds, “that was a sight to see,” and Otto nods emphatically.\n\n\n “I don’t care how much I piss off that old bastard. This time, thanks to all of his pestering, not pissing him off would have been even harder.”\n\n\n It seems like the gulf between Benno and the guild master has grown even wider and deeper thanks to these events.\n\n\n “Anyhow, this time for sure I’ve confirmed that our registration is complete. Now, it’s time to put everything into making and selling some paper. First off, I’ve got to decide on a workshop in the city.”\n\n\n Now that the complicated problems have been solved, Benno starts talking about how he’d like to decide on a workshop for putting paper into production.\n\n\n “I’d like to get mass production going at a workshop shortly after this summer’s baptismal ceremonies are complete.”\n\n\n “Why?” asks Otto, tilting his head curiously.\n\n\n “After doing a lot of profit calculations, I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s best to get started after Lutz is baptized and starts his apprenticeship here. At that point, I don’t need to pay these two anymore. Plus, by the time I find a workshop, have the equipment made, procure the raw materials, and have the staff learn the manufacturing technique, it’ll be around that time anyway.”\n\n\n “Hm, you’re right,” I say.\n\n\n It had been hard for Lutz and I to secure our own tools as well. It’s only natural that getting however many large-scale tools he’d need for mass production would be incredibly difficult.\n\n\n “In any event, Ma?ne, Lutz. I’ll be consulting with you on picking out a workshop, and you’ll tell me everything you know about the manufacturing process.”\n\n\n It seems that now it’s Benno’s turn to ask the real questions. Lutz and I exchange a glance, and let out tired sighs."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Tell me everything you know about paper-making, so that I can figure out where and how large the workshop will be,” says Benno, looking very self-important. Wouldn’t it be appropriate, though, for me to ask for a fee for this information, like I did for the rinsham?\n\n\n Watching him carefully, I open my mouth. “Lutz and I aren’t going to make any money off of this paper makers’ association of yours, so we’re going to have to charge you for any information about actually making paper, you know?”\n\n\n “…Ah well, can’t be helped. How much?”\n\n\n Benno smiles, smugly, tapping the table with his finger. How much should I actually charge, though? I have no idea whatsoever what a fair price would be in this case.\n\n\n “Ummm, how much are you willing to pay?”\n\n\n “Whatever you ask for. How much?”\n\n\n He turns the question back around on me, his smile widening, perhaps having guessed my thought process. The only reference point I have for information fees is the rinsham, which was three small gold coins. Since Benno’s going as far as to make a new trade association for vegetable-based paper, he must be thinking that he’ll be able to do great things with this.\n\n\n “Nnngh… H… how about tw… twice the fee from the rinsham?”\n\n\n “Alright, deal. Here.”\n\n\n Benno pulls out his guild card and waves it around in front of me. I take mine out and clink it against his. He just calmly accepted my offer without even the slightest flicker in his broad smile. Should I have charged him way more? I really don’t have any idea how to estimate these things at all.\n\n\n As I ponder, grumbling, Otto folds his arms, looking at Benno.\n\n\n “For the workshop, let’s listen to what Ma?ne has to say, then start thinking about the size and amount of equipment we’ll need, and the scale and location of the workshop itself. For now, we can probably just appropriate the tools that we already have at the storehouse, right?”\n\n\n Otto’s words cause my eyes to bug out.\n\n\n “Those are the property of Ma?ne’s Workshop!” I say. “If you take them, then won’t Lutz and I basically not be able to make paper anymore?”\n\n\n “…The storehouse itself is Master Benno’s, though,” adds Lutz.\n\n\n I glare at Lutz, lips pursed, when he interjects, then look over at Benno. If they start doing things like appropriating our tools, then we’d be in a lot of trouble. Plus, those tools aren’t at all suited for mass production.\n\n\n “Also,” I add, “that really won’t work. The tools we have at Ma?ne’s Workshop can’t really be used for mass production.”\n\n\n “Hm?”\n\n\n Benno raises his eyebrows, not following my train of thought. I start to explain.\n\n\n “Our tools were made primarily for the sake of finishing our prototype, so we made them easy for us to use. They’re lightweight, miniaturized, and simplified, so they’re not really suited for mass production. Also, I was concerned about spending too much of your money, sir, so I made several substitutions using things at hand…”\n\n\n “Huh?” says Otto. “Why would you be concerned about that when he said he’d give you money? It would have been better to put together the best equipment you could…”\n\n\n Otto looks at me like I’m an idiot, but I really hadn’t been thinking about trying to put together the best possible equipment at all. Back then, getting even a single nail was extremely difficult for me, so the only thing I was thinking about was how I could make things as cheaply as possible.\n\n\n “I wouldn’t have done something so shameless,” I reply. “I think that I might get a little more bold in the future, though.”\n\n\n “I really don’t care if you get more bold,” says Benno. “So, when you say these aren’t suited for mass production, what do you mean by that?”\n\n\n “There’s a difference in physique.”\n\n\n I think about how to phrase things in a way that’s easiest for Benno to understand.\n\n\n “For example, the paper frame that the two of us have been using is the size of a written contract, but an adult man could probably use a much bigger paper frame for making paper. If you could use a frame that’s large enough to make four sheets at a time, then you’d save a lot of time.”\n\n\n “Ah, I see.”\n\n\n Even if you scale up the operation, if you still make relatively small contract-sized sheets one by one, all you’ll do is increase the amount of time and manpower you’re using. If you’re strong enough to use a larger paper frame, then making several sheets at once is a better idea.\n\n\n “And also, since we wanted something we could actually handle, we’re using a large tub to make pulp, but if you’re going to use a larger paper frame, then you’d need a larger vat to make all the pulp you’d need, wouldn’t you? And right now, I’m using cooking chopsticks to mix the pulp instead of the rake you’d usually use…”\n\n\n “I’m not familiar with any of these tools,” says Benno, tapping his temple thoughtfully and looking down at me. Most of these tools are things that we didn’t order through him.\n\n\n “Hmmm, I think that it might be hard to understand what kind of tools you’d need and what we’ve been substituting if we don’t show you our actual process down at the storehouse while we explain it.”\n\n\n “Oh? Well then, I’ll stop by your storehouse tomorrow to observe you. I haven’t actually seen your workshop before, so this is a perfect chance.”\n\n\n I’m startled by how smoothly he suddenly decides tomorrow’s course of action. I try to recall what plans we’d already had for making paper.\n\n\n “Even if you say you want to come by to observe us, we unfortunately just finished our current round of paper today. So, tomorrow all that we’ll be doing is letting it dry, so we don’t particularly have anything to do with that particular batch, so we were thinking that we’d go to the forest tomorrow to gather raw materials…”\n\n\n “Hoh, so you’re saying that you’re starting a brand new batch?”\n\n\n “That’s right. We’ll be cutting wood, steaming it, and stripping off the bark. We’ll then bring it back to the warehouse to let it dry, and that’s about it.”\n\n\n As I talk, Benno nods along.\n\n\n “Alright,” he says, “Mark will go with you.”\n\n\n “Huh? To the forest?”\n\n\n When he says that, I try to picture Mark coming to the forest with us. It just doesn’t work. I refuse.\n\n\n “Mister Mark is a wonderfully proper gentleman who always dresses impeccably. He’s not at all suited for things like cutting wood or stripping bark. …Hmm, but, Mister Benno, you’d be alright wearing work clothes, right?”\n\n\n “Hey, what do you mean by that?!”\n\n\n “What I’m saying is that you’re the one who wants to learn more about the work, sir, so I think it would be best for you to go.”\n\n\n “That’s not what you just said.”\n\n\n Even though he has a pretty disagreeable expression on, Benno agrees that he does want to understand the process from beginning to end, so he decides to accompany us after all. Before we know it, we’ve made plans to head off to the forest to work tomorrow.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, when Lutz went to retrieve the key to the warehouse, it seems that he apparently found Benno, already wearing work clothes. Mark, who came out to greet Lutz, had a troubled expression on his face, constantly worried that Benno might be running wild. Lutz quietly whispers all of this to me shortly after he returns.\n\n\n “I’m impressed you can work in such a tiny space,” says Benno.\n\n\n He slowly spins around inside the storehouse, taking it all in. To Benno, who usually works in such a large shop, it’s only natural that a storehouse only big enough for two children to loiter in would seem very cramped.\n\n\n “It’s fine for when it’s just me and Lutz, but when you’re here as well it is pretty small. Well, most of our work takes place outside, so there’s not a lot that we actually do in here, you know.”\n\n\n We start gathering up the tools we usually take with us when we head to the forest to gather materials. Into the pot, we put the steamer, the bucket, and a bit of firewood. Today, all I’m carrying in the basket strapped to my back is my pair of chopsticks, the plank I use in place of a plate, some kalfe root, and some butter. Benno offers to carry part of Lutz’s load, but Lutz just slowly shakes his head.\n\n\n “It’s okay, I’m used to it by now… uh, sir. Instead of helping with my stuff, it would really help if you could carry Ma?ne.”\n\n\n “You always carry all of this, kid?” Benno replies, frowning. “That must be rough, isn’t it?”\n\n\n He snorts, then abruptly picks me up, backpack and all, carrying me piggyback.\n\n\n “Wha?!”\n\n\n “Hold on tight. Lutz, give me that big wooden frame, at least. I can’t stand how it looks like it might get smashed.”\n\n\n Benno takes the steamer in one hand, then starts walking. His strides are enormous, and he sways back and forth a lot as he walks. Terrified, I cling tightly to his head.\n\n\n “Ummm, so we picked the size of our pot based on what Lutz is able to carry, but since the pot is fairly small that means that the amount of wood we can steam at once has to be small as well. You should probably consider whether you want to use one big pot or a few smaller pots, I think? If you find a workshop near the river, then you won’t have to carry the pots to the river, just the materials, so it’ll be much easier.”\n\n\n “Mhmm…”\n\n\n Since today we’re going with Benno, an adult, we don’t need to be with the rest of the unbaptized children today. We skip the usual meeting point entirely and head straight from the storehouse to the southern gates. When we arrive, I see my father and Otto talking about something.\n\n\n “Daddy, Mister Otto. We’re heading out!”\n\n\n I give the two of them a big wave over Benno’s shoulder. Their eyes widen a bit, and they hurry over to us.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, who’s this?” says my father.\n\n\n “This is Mister Benno, the merchant that I’ve been working with. Mister Benno, this is my father.”\n\n\n While the two of them exchange their greetings, I notice out of the corner of my eye that Otto is shaking a little bit.\n\n\n “Mister Otto, what’s wrong?”\n\n\n “Oh, nothing, I mean, looking at you two together, Benno’s looking a little bit fatherly…”\n\n\n “Shut up, Otto. I’m a bachelor.”\n\n\n Benno angrily smacks Otto upside the head, then starts walking with long, swaying strides.\n\n\n Huh, Benno’s a bachelor, he says? He’s at a great age, though.\n\n\n Since the marriage age is pretty low around here, my father is barely in his thirties. It feels a little strange for Benno, who looks to be roughly the same age as my father, to be unmarried.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, you’re not going to get married?” I asked.\n\n\n “…Yeah, probably not.”\n\n\n “Would it be okay for me to ask why? This is purely out of curiosity, so if you don’t want to say then I can forget all about it.” Benno smiles wryly. “It’s not like it’s a big secret,” he says. “When I wanted to get married, I had my hands full taking care of my family. After Corinna got married, I didn’t have anyone left that I still had to take care of, but then the woman I wanted to marry died. There wasn’t anyone else but her, so I never got married. That’s it.”\n\n\n “That’s it,” he says, even though it’s such a heavy story.\n\n\n I let out a slow sigh. The reason he’s single is because a very important person to him died. I can’t really pester him for more details, nor can I poke fun at his bachelorhood. I pat his head gently, and he smiles wryly.\n\n\n “What’s this, now?”\n\n\n “Oh, nothing. I just thought that you were going to say that you’re single because you’re in charge of such a large shop and things like marriage and succession and all of that would make your life obnoxious.”\n\n\n “Well, you’re not wrong. But, it’s been pretty quiet lately. I’ll be training Corinna’s kids to by my successors so there’s no problem there. That was one of the conditions I gave for those two to get married, after all.”\n\n\n Whoa. Hang in there, Mister Otto.\n\n\n As I quietly cheer him on in my heart, we reach the end of the dark tunnel and emerge into the world beyond, where the stone-paved road is replaced with dirt and the air is much, much fresher. The broad field of view leaves me with a great sense of freedom.\n\n\n “Ahhh, it’s been a while since I’ve gone to the forest,” says Benno.\n\n\n “Now that you mention it, you did say a while ago that you’d gone picking paru. I thought that merchants’ children didn’t really go to the forest, though. Freida even said that she’d never been except for picnics…”\n\n\n I can’t forget the shock I’d felt when Freida said that it sounded like I went on picnics every day. Benno chuckles, then gets a nostalgic look in his eyes.\n\n\n “I’d occasionally slip out of my house to go in secret,” he says.\n\n\n “In secret…”\n\n\n “The other apprentices around my age that were working in my family’s shop would go there to forage, you know? So it’s only natural that I’d get curious, right? Kids still do that, right?”\n\n\n “…Aaaah, yeah,” says Lutz, “now that you mention it, every now and then when some of the apprentice kids come with us I see some people I don’t really know.”\n\n\n After their baptisms, apprentices still go to the forest on their days off to forage or hunt. Unlike us pre-baptismal children, they can go to and from the forest freely, so there’s lots of them that just go whenever they want. However, sometimes they have friends who aren’t apprentices yet, so they occasionally meet up with other kids at the usual meeting stop and go with the group. It seems like even Benno went with other kids like that.\n\n\n “So, how do the children of merchants generally spend their time?” I ask.\n\n\n “I spent most of my time studying. I studied how to receive customers that come to the shop. When I went to the town market, I had to do calculations on the prices I saw, learn how to identify outsiders, how to tell when goods were good or bad, and so on…”\n\n\n No matter how he describes it, it’s really difficult for me to understand a life where every single action is related to commerce. All I can really understand from that is how utterly different his life was compared to mine and Lutz’s.\n\n\n “That’s certainly very different from how Lutz and I live, huh…”\n\n\n “I’m sure kids from smaller shops are even more different, too.”\n\n\n Lutz puts our gear down by the riverside, makes sure the fireplace is still intact, and sets up the pot. I draw some water from the river, pour it into the pot, and set the steamer on top of it. Today, I throw in potato-like kalfe roots in as well.\n\n\n “I’m going to go cut some wood,” says Lutz. He looks up at Benno. “What will—”\n\n\n “Lutz,” Benno interrupts, “if you’re going to work at my shop, start calling me ‘sir’.”\n\n\n “Sir, what will you do? Are you going to stay here and wait with Ma?ne, come with me to cut wood, or…”\n\n\n “I’m interested in the kind of wood that you’ll be cutting, so I’ll go with you. Shall we?”\n\n\n Lutz and Benno head deeper into the forest to search for wood. I collect whatever firewood I can find in the area around the pot, keeping an eye on our things. The two of them eventually come back, carrying a lot of freshly-cut wood. When Benno looks at me sitting idly by the pot, he raises his eyebrows a bit.\n\n\n “You’re not doing anything?”\n\n\n “You asked me what I can actually do, right? Right now, my job is to sit here and be quiet. If I faint, there usually isn’t anyone here to carry me back home.”\n\n\n When Lutz isn’t by my side, that’s when I have to try my hardest to move around as little as possible, or so I’m constantly told. There have been many, many times where I’ve arbitrarily started doing things on my own and wound up causing a lot of trouble for everyone.\n\n\n “…Lutz, you always surprise me with how patient you are.”\n\n\n “That’s right!” I say. “You’re really amazing.”\n\n\n “Stop it, Ma?ne!” he says, giving me an embarrassed glare. “I’m gonna go grab some more firewood.”\n\n\n He makes his escape, and Benno and I grin at his back as he runs off. Then, I pull out my knife. I start picking folin out of the pile of wood Lutz brought back and cutting it down to a size that will fit into the steamer. Meanwhile, I keep telling Benno about Lutz.\n\n\n “Lutz really is amazing. If he hadn’t been there, I don’t think I’d even still be alive. The first time the devouring tried to swallow me, he saved me.”\n\n\n “Oh?” he says, looking a little impressed.\n\n\n “Back then, before we started doing things that actually made money, Lutz was always looking after me, and helping me make a lot of different things.”\n\n\n “…Ah, I’d heard about that. So, Lutz is basically your patron, then?”\n\n\n It was entirely possible for me to have hogged all of the profits to myself for our winter handiwork and our paper-making enterprises. To a merchant, it must seem very strange for me to split the rights and profits for the things I’ve been dragging him into.\n\n\n “That’s right. Since Lutz basically saved my life, I’ve been doing what I can to help him. Although all I’ve really been able to do is come up with new things to make, and then once we have that, sell them through you and make money off of that.”\n\n\n “…Ah, I see. So, I need to make sure to keep him at my store at any cost, hm.”\n\n\n “Thank you for your continued support,” I reply.\n\n\n Benno pats me on the head, as if to say “leave it to me”, and I feel relieved.\n\n\n By the time I finish cutting the folin down to sticks of about the same length, Lutz comes back. He adds some water to the pot, and I use my cooking chopsticks to put the wood into the steamer, taking out the potatoes already in there.\n\n\n “Lutz, quick, add the butter!”\n\n\n “Yeah, I know!”\n\n\n He sticks some butter in it, giving us buttered potatoes. Benno looks down at the potatoes lined up on the plate-substitute board with the same unimpressed expression that Lutz had the first time he’d tried it.\n\n\n “Master Benno, sir, Ma?ne’s cooking is really delicious. Even if it’s just a potato.”\n\n\n Lutz laughs excitedly as he bites into his potato. Seeing this, Benno shrugs, lifting his potato to his mouth as if he doesn’t have much choice in the matter.\n\n\n “…That’s actually good.”\n\n\n “Eh heh heh, steaming it actually locks in all of the flavor, and biting into a piping hot potato on a cold day is really extraordinary.”\n\n\n After we finish eating our potatoes, we ask Benno to keep an eye on the pot for us while Lutz and I start foraging. We manage to gather a few medicinal plants.\n\n\n After the bark is steamed, we rinse it in the river water and immediately start stripping it off. Benno helps us as well, but he’s unexpectedly clumsy with his knife, and leaves the bark in tatters. As he helps us, I watch our total amount of usable bark slowly decrease.\n\n\n “Mister Benno,” I say, “we’re all done with stripping the bark now. Could you please help Lutz clean up?”\n\n\n Since we’re done stripping bark, we head back to the storehouse and hang the bark up to dry. Benno wrinkles his nose when we ask him to hang the bark on the nails we have pounded into the shelves, but helps us out anyways. I’m a little envious of how he doesn’t need to slowly inch a footstool along as he works in order to reach the top shelves.\n\n\n “Like this, if we had any more bark then we wouldn’t be able to dry it. If we wanted to dry that much, then you’d want to build something like this.”\n\n\n I sketch out diagrams on my slate, explaining some of the tools we don’t have at the workshop. Benno nods, asks questions, and picks up some of the tools we do have to feel them.\n\n\n “We’ll dry this batch of bark in the sun until it’s completely dried. If we don’t make sure it’s entirely dry, then it might start getting moldy. Then, we’ll take the dried bark and soak it in the river for at least a day.”\n\n\n “Hm, that could be stolen then.”\n\n\n “That’s right. That’s the part that’s the most worrying. If someone knows how this is made, then here’s where the money is. That’s why I think it’s all the more important for the workshop to be near the river.”\n\n\n As I continue talking, I pat the bag of ash sitting in the corner of the workshop.\n\n\n “After soaking the bark in the river, we use our knives to strip off the outer bark, boil the inner bark with ash, and then soak it in the river for another day. Boiling the bark with the ash makes the fibers soft and flexible.”\n\n\n “I see…”\n\n\n “After that, we remove any impurities or defects from the fibers, then beat the fibers with this rectangular stick here until they’re as soft as cotton. This specific one is sized for Lutz, so an adult man could use a much larger and heavier stick, which would be more efficient.”\n\n\n I point at the table we use for beating fibers, and Benno picks up the stick and waves it around. “I would want something heavier if I was going to be smashing things,” he murmurs.\n\n\n “Then, we take the now-fluffy fibers and mix them with a sticky fluid called a binding agent, making pulp. Since we’re using this paper frame, we can make it in this tub, but an adult would be able to use a much bigger paper frame, so increasing the size of both the frame and the tub would let you make much more paper. To mix the pulp we’ve just been using a bunch of cooking chopsticks that Lutz made tied together, but if you’re using a big vat then you wouldn’t be able to mix the entire thing together like that, so you’d want to use a larger tool, something like a large comb to mix it. Something like this.”\n\n\n I sketch out another diagram on my slate. Benno hums thoughtfully, and starts stroking his chin.\n\n\n “After that, we use this paper frame. We shake and tilt it around like this, to make sure that it all ends up the same thickness, then take the finished sheet and pile it here, on the paper bed. We let it dry on its own, giving us this,” I say, indicating the pile of mostly-dried paper on the bed. “Tomorrow, we’ll put a weight on top of the pile, drying it out even more.”\n\n\n “What for?”\n\n\n “This will squeeze the last of the stickiness from the binder out. After that, we stick each sheet to that board over there, one by one, and let it dry out in the sunlight. Once we peel it off from there, the paper is finally done.”\n\n\n After I finish my rough explanation of the entire process, Benno lets out a long sigh, seeming to admire our work.\n\n\n “This is a much longer process than I’d thought,” he says.\n\n\n “Well, while it’s drying, then you can work on something else, so it doesn’t really feel like that long of a process. If you want to make a lot of it, I think you’d wind up very busy. Besides, right now, actually going into the river is extremely difficult.”\n\n\n Benno nods deeply, having helped us draw water from the river today. “So this’ll be the kind of workshop that shuts down in the winter,” he mutters. If you couldn’t put the wood in the river during the winter, then it would be too hard to work with, so you couldn’t make any paper.\n\n\n “Since you can’t make it without a river, please make sure you think very hard about the location of the workshop itself.”\n\n\n “Alright, got it. Looks like things are going to be pretty hectic for me, then!”\n\n\n Despite the fact that he says things will be hectic, he looks like he’s actually enjoying himself. You can do it! I think to myself, silently cheering him on.\n\n\n I thought that at that point everything would be completely out of my hands, but Benno, having only a little practical experience making paper, excitedly starts picking out workshops, the people who wind up being extremely busy are me and Lutz. When we’re not making paper, Mark sticks to us like glue, escorting us around to various craftsmen to help him order tools and equipment. “This is still covered under your information fee,” we’re told, and are given no choice but to go along with it.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The tools are made, the people are gathered, the manufacturing process is explained, and the warehouse is acquired. By the time things start coming together, the season has turned to summer."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Ma?ne, what should we do today? The weather looks pretty bad.”\n\n\n The dull, heavy clouds that blanket the sky outside my window aren’t at all ideal for making paper. It might still be possible to go to the forest to forage, but if it suddenly starts pouring I’ll just wind up being a huge burden, so I should probably just stay home and watch the house.\n\n\n This spring, on days when we’ve been blessed with good weather, we worked on making paper to earn some money. When the weather wasn’t quite so good, we went with Mark, wandering around the city as we worked on getting the workshop ready. However, by now, the workshop is basically finished and all of the workers have been trained. The other day, they even successfully finished their trial run, so by now there’s not a whole lot left for me and Lutz to do.\n\n\n “Mister Benno said that our baptismal ceremony is next Fire Day, so I wanted to do our last round of paper making, but I guess we can’t help the weather being as bad as it is, huh…”\n\n\n “Kinda sucks about not being able to do another batch of paper, but man, I still can’t believe that I have so much money now, right?”\n\n\n Every time we went to deliver our paper, we each brought back one small silver coin with us for spending money, which we gave to our families. This meant that our food situation had gotten a little bit better, but our lifestyles ultimately hadn’t really changed all that much. The amount of money we have stored with the guild, however, is enormous, partly due to just how comparatively great the weather has been for paper making and partly due to the fact that tronbay paper sells for an enormously high cost. After our most recent sale the other day, I now have a little more than two large gold coins’ worth of money saved up, and Lutz isn’t very far behind at all. No matter how you think about it, this is not the kind of money pre-baptized children should have.\n\n\n Well, I guess that once we’re baptized, I won’t be earning any money for a little while, after all.\n\n\n I think to myself, going over the list of what we needed to do before the day of our baptismal ceremonies, then suddenly look up in shock.\n\n\n “Lutz, we need to go see Mister Benno today. I completely forgot!”\n\n\n “Huh? He’s not expecting us, is he?”\n\n\n “Oh, he isn’t, but our baptisms are next Fire Day, right? We need to make sure that you’ve got everything that you’ll need for your apprenticeship already prepared. …Your parents aren’t merchants, so they won’t have any tools prepared for you, you know?”\n\n\n “…Ah!”\n\n\n Since a child’s baptism marks the day they start working, it’s tradition for those children to be given the clothing and equipment they’ll need for their new apprenticeships. When a child follows in their parents’ footsteps, their parents pick out those tools to give to them as presents, as if to say, “do your best”.\n\n\n However, Lutz’s parents haven’t been able to prepare him anything. One reason is that Lutz’s father still objects to this course of action. Another is that since neither of his parents are merchants, neither of them know what tools he’ll actually need. Even worse, they don’t even know just how much money it would take to get someone prepared to be a merchant’s apprentice.\n\n\n Benno told us that clothing was necessary, and we’d placed an order, but I can’t believe that that could possibly be enough. When Tuuli, a seamstress’s apprentice, was baptized, our parents gave her not just a set of work clothes but also a kit full of sewing supplies. It’s highly likely that a merchant is going to need much more than just clothing. Luckily, we’ve saved up quite a lot of money, so we should be able to buy whatever we need to ourselves, and if we ask Benno or Mark, they’ll probably tell us what we need to know.\n\n\n “I really don’t know what else you’ll need besides clothes,” I say. “Since you’ll be doing a lot of studying as part of your new hire training, you’ll need your slate and your calculator, but there’s got to be more than just that, right?”\n\n\n “Right now, we can buy whatever we need. I’m really glad we saved up all that money, just like you said.”\n\n\n Even though Auntie Karla had become Lutz’s ally, there really wasn’t much of anything she could actually do to help her son become a merchant. She doesn’t have any connections to any merchants, and Lutz’s father still opposes his decision. All she was really able to do is scold his brothers for their bad behavior, but Lutz has told me that even just that has made his life a little easier.\n\n\n “When you become an apprentice, Mister Benno is basically going to be acting as your guardian, so I think it would be best for us to go ask him about it,” I say.\n\n\n I grab my usual tote bag and head out into the gloomy weather with Lutz, walking towards Benno’s shop.\n\n\n “Oh my, but I thought you weren’t going to have any more paper for us for another few days?”\n\n\n Mark, who has more-or-less figured our schedule out by now, looks a little surprised to see us approach.\n\n\n “We’re hoping to ask Mister Benno about something,” I say. “…Although, maybe we might be able to ask you?”\n\n\n I think I remember hearing that Mark was in charge of educating apprentices at this shop, at least.\n\n\n “What might you need?”\n\n\n “We’d like to know what kinds of things, such as tools, an apprentice might need. Lutz’s parents aren’t merchants, so they don’t know what kinds of work-related things to give to him at his baptism, so we need to prepare these ourselves…”\n\n\n “Ahh, I see,” he says, looking a little astonished. “I hadn’t thought of that.” He frowns slightly, tapping on his temples.\n\n\n “I know the ceremony is very soon,” I say, “but do we still have enough time? Since Mister Benno will be Lutz’s guardian, would it be best for us to discuss this with him?”\n\n\n “Hmm, you’re right. After you’ve finished your discussion with the master, shall we go purchase what you need?”\n\n\n As usual, we’re led into the inner room. There, we see a busy-looking Benno, sitting at a desk piled high with boards and papers, quickly scribbling something down.\n\n\n “Master Benno,” says Mark, “Lutz and Ma?ne have come to see you.”\n\n\n “What for?” he asks, not looking up as he continues to write on his board.\n\n\n I gently push Lutz forward, urging him to ask on his own.\n\n\n “Master Benno, sir, I would like to ask you about the equipment I’ll need to prepare for my apprenticeship,” he says.\n\n\n “The equipment you’ll need to prepare…?”\n\n\n Benno puts his pen down, perhaps having reached a good stopping point. He has a dubious expression on his face, like he isn’t quite sure what Lutz is asking, so I step in to explain further.\n\n\n “Ordinarily, we were thinking that his parents would prepare these things, but since neither of Lutz’s parents are merchants, they don’t actually know what he needs. So, what will Lutz be needing when he becomes an apprentice? Surely it’s more than just clothes, right?”\n\n\n “Ahh, that’s right. Go with Mark to buy your things. I got word that the clothes you ordered before are done, so go order a few changes of clothes when you go pick those up.”\n\n\n “Alright,” I say, nodding.\n\n\n Lutz looks confused, slowly tilting his head to the side.\n\n\n “Changes of clothes?”\n\n\n “Obviously,” replies Benno. “There’s no way you’ll wear the same set of clothes to work day after day, will you? It’ll be a big problem if they get dirty or start stinking.”\n\n\n Since this is a shop that deals with the nobility, appearance is extremely important. An employee would absolutely not be able to show themselves in torn or dirty clothing. Practically every employee of this shop is always dressed very tidily.\n\n\n “A change of clothes for every day, sir?” Lutz asks, frowning.\n\n\n “That’s right.”\n\n\n “…You kidding me?”\n\n\n In Tuuli’s case, and probably Lutz’s brothers’ cases as well, her work clothes get washed once a week. It’s work that our mother does on her day off, so the concept of changing clothes every day doesn’t even really exist. Since we don’t even have much in the way of ordinary clothing, we keep wearing the same set of clothing for as long as any freshly-laundered clothing is still drying. Also, when fabric gets washed, it gets damaged bit by bit, so there are many families that, with the exception of underwear, avoid washing their clothes for as long as they can bear it.\n\n\n Unlike Benno, who has subordinates to do it for him, Lutz is on the bottom of his family’s hierarchy. It would probably be very hard for him to ask his mother to wash an entire week’s worth of changes of clothing. However, this is something that is definitely required for work.\n\n\n “If you can’t ask Auntie Karla,” I say, “what if you washed it yourself? You’ll have some free days when you’re an apprentice.”\n\n\n “Urgh…”\n\n\n “If you were a live-in apprentice, then you’d have to do it all by yourself anyway, you know.”\n\n\n “I… guess… you’re right.”\n\n\n I can understand his astonishment; this isn’t at all in line with what he’d thought was common sense. However, there’s nothing he can do now but swallow this new information about what society expects common sense to be.\n\n\n “I know how shocking it is to be hit with something that doesn’t fit your common sense, but you can’t really do anything else but accept it. This is something that you need to do to make sure that the customers don’t get uncomfortable. It’s just another way craftsmen and merchants are different.”\n\n\n “Ah, okay,” he nods.\n\n\n Benno, as well, looks like he’s experiencing some culture shock. He blinks, slowly, muttering to himself.\n\n\n “Your lives really are fundamentally different, huh.”\n\n\n “So, please,” I say, “if you think something might be a little strange, please point it out. We really don’t know anything about it.”\n\n\n “Alright, I’ll keep an eye out. …Mark, I’ll leave these two to you.”\n\n\n “Very well, sir.”\n\n\n We wait briefly for Mark to reach a stopping point in his own work, then the three of us head to pick up our finished clothing. He carries me in his arms along the way there, but after an entire spring of being carried around while making arrangements for the new workshop, I’m fairly resigned to my fate.\n\n\n “Welcome,” says the shopkeeper.\n\n\n With a single glance at Mark, Lutz, and me, she immediately realizes what we’re here for, and she urges us towards rooms deeper in the shop.\n\n\n “Please, try these on.”\n\n\n The clothing that she presents me with is just a simple blouse and skirt, but since it’s cut to my exact measurements, it fits me perfectly. I’d be extremely excited just for clothing that isn’t patched together, but this is order made. I experimentally raise and lower my arms, squat down, and stand back up, checking for any problems with the fit, but it feels incredible. It fits amazingly, with no parts of it too tight or too baggy.\n\n\n “Amazing! This feels great to wear,” I say.\n\n\n “Oh, excellent!” she says. “Now, Mark said you’ll be wearing this today, so I’ll wrap up these clothes for you here.”\n\n\n It seems that Lutz had ordered two more sets of clothes in the same style and design while I was still trying on my clothes. When I leave the dressing room, Mark and Lutz, who had been talking with the shopkeeper, turn to look at me.\n\n\n “You look very cute wearing that,” says Mark. “A simple change of clothes has made you look like a child from a good family.”\n\n\n “Yeah, you look like a proper lady!” adds Lutz.\n\n\n Being praised by the two of them like that gets me even more excited. I pinch up the folds of my skirt.\n\n\n “Really?! I’m cute? Like a proper lady? With just some new clothes?”\n\n\n “When you’re standing still and not talking,” says Lutz.\n\n\n “Hmph,” I sulk. “…But, Lutz, your posture has gotten a lot better lately, too, so you’re looking like a proper gentleman!”\n\n\n Benno has been reminding Lutz to mind his personal appearance, so he’s been keeping himself as clean as he can, and occasionally washing his hair with rinsham. His golden hair is glossy and sparkling. Also, he’s been paying more attention to his posture and movements, saying that he’s copying Mark because I keep talking about how excellent he looks. So, now that he’s in a proper set of clothes, he really does look gentlemanly. He doesn’t look out of place wearing them at all.\n\n\n “Now we will be able to actually enter the other establishments we need to go to,” says Mark.\n\n\n It’s not rare to be turned away at other stores for being improperly dressed. After Lutz and I use our guild cards to finish paying for our clothes, Mark leads the two of us, in our proper garments, towards the next shop.\n\n\n We arrive at a stationery shop, and Mark opens its wooden door, which has the mark of a pen drawn on it. The front of the store is dominated by a long counter, behind which stands a kindly-looking old man, polishing something. Products are neatly lined up shelves along the wall, but since this store doesn’t sell many goods directly, these are largely just individual samples. This is a fairly typical sort of shop in this town. Small shops are primarily reception areas for their customers, with most of their actual goods in storehouses. It’s a necessary measure to protect against robbery, but it’s somewhat of a shame that you can’t easily compare products against each other.\n\n\n “Mister Mark! What can I get for you?”\n\n\n “Hm, let me see. We’ll need an ink pot, a pen, and parchment for a contract of employment. We already have a slate, slate pencil, and calculator, I believe? Then, if we add some number of writing boards, that should be it.”\n\n\n As I listen to Mark, I let out a small sigh. These are definitely not the kinds of things that Lutz’s parents would be able to afford. Lutz and I may be able to afford them now, but neither ink nor parchment are things that we could be able to so easily buy in our usual sphere of influence.\n\n\n “Oh, me too!” I say. “I’d like a pen and some ink, please.”\n\n\n Seizing the opportunity Lutz’s errands have afforded me, I also purchase a pen and an ink pot for myself. Being able to buy ink, which is such an expensive, unobtainable item, leaves me deeply emotional. The old shopkeeper places pen and ink on top of the counter for me. After we touch our guild cards to complete the transaction, I reach out and pick them up.\n\n\n “Woohoo! My own pen and ink!”\n\n\n My smile almost splits my face wide open as I twirl around, holding my new bottle of ink and my wooden pen. However, Lutz’s smile, unlike mine, is bitter.\n\n\n “All that money I saved is just going away bit by bit. …Does being a merchant really cost this much?”\n\n\n In a small shop, they’d probably have the necessary tools already prepared. They also probably wouldn’t make their employees buy parchment for their own employment contracts, either. They’d usually use wooden boards for that, I think?\n\n\n “I don’t think it’s just being a merchant. I think it’s that Benno’s shop is so big. But, you should still have money left over, right?”\n\n\n “But, I mean, we spent so much of it, in just one day! That doesn’t really feel good. I don’t want to have to rely on my parents, so let’s try to make even more paper before our baptismal ceremony.”\n\n\n “We really don’t have much time left, so it’ll be good if it clears up soon, yeah.”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n We return to Benno’s shop and deliver him the news that we’ve finished our shopping. “From now on, wear those clothes whenever you come here,” he tells us, giving us the stamp of approval now that he can see us looking properly apprentice-like.\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz. Where are you going to store all this? The storehouse?”\n\n\n “That’s probably safest, huh…”\n\n\n The two of us start discussing how leaving the things we buy in the storehouse for safekeeping would be a bit of a pain, since we’d need to borrow the key in order to get into it. Benno, overhearing this, shrugs his shoulders.\n\n\n “There’s no real reason to keep any of that in the storehouse, why not just keep it in your own room?”\n\n\n “Umm,” I say, “Mister Benno. We don’t have our own rooms. I only have a wooden box to keep my things in, and I can only keep what I can fit in there.”\n\n\n Benno’s eyes widen when I point out this difference in our standards of living. When I saw Corinna’s house, I’d noticed that there were a lot of rooms. It seems that Benno, who was raised as the successor to a large shop, didn’t have any friends who didn’t have their own rooms, either.\n\n\n “I’ve got it worse then Ma?ne,” says Lutz. “Even if I put stuff in my box, someone will just arbitrarily rummage around in there and take it all out.”\n\n\n “What do you mean by that?”\n\n\n Benno’s eyes are filled with surprise. He squints down at us, uncomprehendingly, and I explain Lutz’s living situation a little more,\n\n\n “Lutz is the youngest of four brothers. So, his older brothers often just do whatever they like with his things. It’s really rough.”\n\n\n “So, the brothers are always stealing each others’ things?”\n\n\n “It’s okay if it’s the younger brother’s things, they say. A younger brother’s things are an older brother’s things. The older brother’s things are only the older brother’s things, though.”\n\n\n Benno rubs his temples as he listens to my description of Lutz’s home life. I’m sure he had no idea that our living situations could possibly have been this different. As a working man who has supported his family ever since his father died, Benno has probably never had to worry about his family stealing his things, nor has he ever had to worry about where to keep his things to begin with. His expression is one of sheer astonishment.\n\n\n “Lutz. How about you store your things upstairs? I’ll rent you one of the live-in apprentice rooms for cheap. If all of these things that you’ve finally put together disappear before your baptismal ceremonies, or if the things you need for work get stolen, that would be a big hindrance to your work here. That storehouse is too far away, too.”\n\n\n “…Thank you very much, sir.”\n\n\n Through Benno’s arrangement, Lutz manages to rent one of the rooms on the top floor of the building that are usually used by live-in apprentices, and use it as a better substitute for our storehouse. If he leaves the things that he’s purchased here and locks the door behind him, then he won’t have to worry about any other person going through any of his things.\n\n\n “So, when I come to the shop, can I come up here first to get changed?”\n\n\n “Sounds great,” he says. He wears an enormous smile over having finally acquired a space of his own.\n\n\n I leave my things here too until we can finally go home. Benno had told us that, since we had some time, we were going to the merchant’s guild with him, so we won’t be able to head home immediately.\n\n\n “If I don’t teach you some things about how the guild works in advance, I can’t use you to run errands, after all.”\n\n\n Since the children of mercantile families constantly visit the guild to help out their parents, it seems like going there to help retrieve documents is a fairly everyday sort of thing for them to be doing. So, one of the things that an apprentice at a shop can do from the very start is run errands at the guild. Even so, Lutz hasn’t been back to the guild ever since we went to deliver Freida’s hairpins, so of course he can’t run any errands there. He just hasn’t ever done so before.\n\n\n “Is there anything else…?” mutters Benno, trying to figure out what other things a merchant’s child would be expected to be able to do. He gathers up a few written applications and hands them to Lutz to bring to the merchant’s guild. I decide to tag along, mostly so that I can read the stacks of wooden tablets they keep on their bookshelves.\n\n\n “Whoa…”\n\n\n “Man, this is nuts.”\n\n\n The merchant’s guild building overlooks the central plaza. In front of it, many wagons are lined up in a long queue. I can see traders leaving their carts in the hands of their fellow passengers as they run into the building, applications in hand. We’re still outside, but already I can see how massively congested everything is.\n\n\n “It looks like the second floor is going to be very busy,” I say.\n\n\n “Yeah,” replies Benno. “The baptismal ceremonies are just around the corner, and market day is pretty soon, too.”\n\n\n Just like I’d predicted after seeing all of the carts outside, the crowd packed into the second floor is enormous. Benno pushes his way through the crowd, Lutz trying to avoid being crushed behind him, as he makes his way towards the inner staircase. As usual, I’m being carried in Benno’s arms, so I’m thankfully not getting crushed too. We show our guild cards to the guards in front of the stairway, and start to ascend. The tumult of the second floor almost instantly fades behind us. I have the strongest suspicion that the gate we passed through has some sort of magic on it to block out sound.\n\n\n “Running errands is going to be really difficult, huh,” sighs Lutz.\n\n\n If we had to force our way through that oppressive wave of people without Benno’s help, we wouldn’t be able to run errands here at all.\n\n\n “It’s possible that your documents could get stolen or crumpled up by other people, so make sure you watch out for that.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir.”\n\n\n “Now then, first off, these documents go…”\n\n\n Benno starts heading towards the counter, giving Lutz an explanation as he goes. I turn my back on the two of them and start heading towards the bookshelves, but Benno smacks me on the back of my head and grabs me by the scruff of my neck.\n\n\n “And just where do you think you’re going, kid?”\n\n\n “…I was going to go to those bookshelves and read.”\n\n\n “In your dreams. You don’t get to go off and read. You’re going to be the head of a workshop, so you need to learn all of this too.”\n\n\n “Yes, sirrr…”\n\n\n Benno teaches the two of us how to use the merchant’s guild services, going over the minute details of how to use the reception desk, as well as the various places that particular documents need to be brought to. He makes sure to point out to me where magical contracts are registered and inspected, since I’ll be working to develop new kinds of goods.\n\n\n “If you file a request here, you can inspect the magical contracts that are registered with the guild.”\n\n\n “Oh my, if it isn’t Ma?ne!”\n\n\n A pair of light pink pigtails rushes up towards us from the other side of the counter. There’s no mistaking who this is. This is the guild master’s granddaughter, Freida. She clearly looks like she’s here to worn as an apprentice. I hadn’t even considered that I might run into her here, so I stand there in shock while Freida crosses her arms and pouts at me.\n\n\n “Spring is nearly over, and you haven’t even been by to visit once!”\n\n\n “Ah, sorry about that, I’ve just been so busy…”\n\n\n I’m really sorry, but between making paper and establishing the new workshop, I’ve been extremely busy. I was thinking that, since I had fulfilled my promise to make sweets with you, I could just kind of break it off. If I were to go, you’d inundate me with invitations, and I wouldn’t know exactly how to spot the traps you’d hide in our conversation, so I wouldn’t be able to relax at all.\n\n\n “Well, I’m free tomorrow, so you’d be most welcome to come and play at my house,” she says.\n\n\n “Oh? Umm, but, if the weather clears up tomorrow, then—”\n\n\n Benno has been lightly resting his hand on my shoulder, and he suddenly squeezes it while I was mid-sentence. I had been about to say that I wanted to make some more paper, but I’m suddenly reminded that he had told us that he wanted us to do everything we could to keep our involvement in the paper-making process a secret, so I hurriedly snap my mouth shut.\n\n\n Freida glances briefly at Benno’s hand, then smiles sweetly. “If it’s raining tomorrow, then you’re very welcome to come over. It seems that you’ll be busy again if the weather clears up, but if it’s raining, perhaps you’ll come and play? I do recall you promised you’d stop by this spring, yet spring is just about at its end.”\n\n\n “Urgh…”\n\n\n If she phrases it like that, it’s hard to refuse. It’s true that if the weather is bad tomorrow I won’t be able to make any paper and will thus have plenty of free time.\n\n\n As I waver, she piles on more pressure. “There’s so much I want to talk with you about, especially about the devouring.”\n\n\n “Oh, I had some questions about that as well.”\n\n\n The person I know who has the most knowledge about the devouring is, in fact, Freida. There’s things that I’ve been thinking I want to ask her about, so the chance to speak with her is actually really helpful.\n\n\n When I say this, Freida’s face immediately lights up, and she claps her hands joyfully.\n\n\n “So, if it rains, then this will be perfect! I’ll make some pound cake and have it waiting for you.”\n\n\n “That sounds great. If it rains…”\n\n\n Fascinated by the thought of pound cake, I agree to her proposal. Benno’s grip tightens on my shoulder even more. He smiles down at me, a blood vessel clearly popping out on his temple.\n\n\n “Ma?ne,” he says, very patiently.\n\n\n “Mister Benno,” says Freida, smiling sweetly as she jumps in to save me. “we’re just talking about if it rains.”\n\n\n “Yes, that’s right!” I add, looking up at him. “Only if it rains, you know?” I reach up and pat his hand gently as his fingers dig deeper into my shoulder.\n\n\n “This idiot,” he grumbles to himself, then looks back down at me. “It will rain tomorrow,” he says, matter-of-factly. “Huh?”\n\n\n It seems that everyone here knows how to read the weather, even without a weather forecast. The rain that begins to fall in the evening lasts all the way through the night, and continues well into the day."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n It’s raining today. There’s no doubt about it, it’s raining today.\n\n\n The patter of heavy raindrops hitting the wooden shutters of the kitchen window causes my shoulders to slump as I sit there, eating my breakfast. Just like Freida had been laughing about, and just like Benno had been growling about, it is definitely raining. There’s no helping it, then! Since it’s already been determined that I’m going to have to go to Freida’s house, at the very least I’m going to try my best to get at least a little bit of good information out of her.\n\n\n Lutz will be there too, so everything will be fine.\n\n\n I take a hard hunk of millet bread, soak it in some of last night’s leftover soup, and chew soggily on it. I use the last of my bread to wipe off my plate, then, having finished breakfast, start looking around the room. I let out a long sigh.\n\n\n “I want to bring some sort of present, but we really don’t have anything here that I could bring to that house, do we…”\n\n\n Freida’s house is already full of the kinds of things the nobility keep in their houses. There’s nothing here that I could possibly give to a girl who already has everything.\n\n\n Tuuli gulps down some water, then looks at me, head tilted to the side.\n\n\n “What about some ‘simple shampoo’? She was really happy when you brought her some last time, right?”\n\n\n “Hmm… it’s gone on the market already, so Benno told me that if I was going to keep making some for myself, then I can’t be giving it away as much as I want.”\n\n\n “Oh, I see. And it’s raining, too, so you can’t pick any flowers or anything like that… yeah, that’s kind of a problem.”\n\n\n Tuuli uses a little bit of water from the water jug to wash off her plate as she talks to me. When she finishes rinsing it, she starts hurrying to get ready to head off for work. Our mother has already left, and our father is currently fast asleep after coming home late from the night shift. I start washing my own plate as well, trying to keep my voice down.\n\n\n “If only we could have decided this a few days in advance. Then I could have gone to the forest on a sunny day and picked some fruit to take with me…”\n\n\n Benno’s been so accommodating towards Lutz. He’s been so accommodating towards me as well, helping me set up Ma?ne’s Workshop so that I can keep thinking up new product ideas. Lately, I’ve been really trying to avoid doing anything that will make him angry. Sure, I’ve carelessly let slip a few secrets while chatting, and sure I’ve fallen prey to my own desires and just kind of arbitrarily made a few things, but none of that was intentional. There’s no way that I actually wanted him to be angry at me. So, if I want to avoid his wrath, rinsham is out. Anything at all to do with paper is out. If I bring a new dessert recipe, then both Freida and Ilse would be happy, I think, but Benno would absolutely get angry, so that’s out, too.\n\n\n Well, now that I’m not going to be his apprentice, it really is entirely my own business who I give my sweets recipes to, I think, but it would still be more trouble than it’s worth.\n\n\n As I hum thoughtfully to myself, a loud knock comes from the kitchen door. Tuuli, looking just about ready for work and having just finished putting on a thick cape that has been treated with oil and wax to ward off the rain, heads towards the door.\n\n\n “Hello, who’s there?” she says.\n\n\n Ah, I guess Lutz is a little early today, I think to myself, as I put away my clean plate. Suddenly, Tuuli’s startled voice rips through the kitchen.\n\n\n “Freida?! Why are you…?!”\n\n\n As soon as I hear those entirely unexpected words, I snap my head around to see Frieda standing outside our front door, accompanied by an attendant. Despite the rain, she is dressed as magnificently as ever, and her attendant wears a tidy uniform. They clash horribly with the impoverished backdrop of my home, emphasizing just how poor my family really is.\n\n\n “I have been so excited ever since I woke up that I just couldn’t stand it, so I’ve come to pick Ma?ne up,” she says, smiling sweetly.\n\n\n I hear an undercurrent of “did you think I’d let you escape?” buried in those words, and a shiver runs down my spine. I want to look away and pretend not to have seen any of this, but I can’t just flee and leave Tuuli behind.\n\n\n “Whoa,” says Tuuli, smiling as she waves me over, “you must have been really excited to come all this way in this kind of rain!”\n\n\n Tuuli, you’re an angel. Don’t lose any of that purity.\n\n\n “Ah, but it is exactly because of the rain that I have come! I couldn’t possibly ask frail Ma?ne to walk outside in weather like this. I have a carriage waiting for us on the main road.”\n\n\n It seems she thought I might have refused to come because I didn’t want to catch a cold in the rain. I can’t help but be a little impressed with her level of preparation.\n\n\n “Whoa,” says Tuuli, an innocent envy showing on her face, “a carriage?! Wow, Ma?ne, luckyyy!”\n\n\n Freida looks over at Tuuli, noticing that she’s carrying her things for work.\n\n\n “Oh my,” she says, slightly tilting her head to the side, “but are you not leaving for work, perhaps?”\n\n\n “That’s right,” replies Tuuli, a twinge of regret in her voice. “I’ve got to get going soon.”\n\n\n Frieda glances away momentarily as if thinking about something, then suddenly claps her hands together, a meaningful smile floating across her face.\n\n\n “Well, if that’s the case, perhaps we can drop you off along the way.”\n\n\n “What?! Really?! I can ride the carriage too?!”\n\n\n Tuuli’s face lights up immediately. A carriage is the kind of thing that poor people like us would ordinarily never get to ride on. I understand her excitement perfectly. It looks like I don’t have any choice but to get ready to go immediately.\n\n\n “Tuuli, I’ve got to go get Lutz,” I say.\n\n\n “Ah, that’s right! I’ll go run and get him.”\n\n\n “Oh,” says Freida, “but, if Lutz comes along, then you won’t have anywhere to sit…”\n\n\n Tuuli sets down her bags and starts to dart out the door when Freida apologetically stops her. At this point, whenever I go out, Lutz comes along with me as my minder. But, if Lutz comes with us, then Tuuli won’t be able to ride in the carriage, and will have to back out.\n\n\n “Huh? Um? …Then, I… can’t go?”\n\n\n Her brief glimmer of home turns to despair. She hangs her head, looking like she’s on the verge of tears. As I frantically try to figure out what to say to comfort her, Freida smoothly steps in. She takes Tuuli’s hand and then, and then, gives her a gentle smile.\n\n\n “Tuuli, today, Ma?ne is my responsibility. I’ll take care of picking her up and dropping her off. I can promise you that I will take extra care to make sure she does not fall ill. So, why don’t you ride along with us?”\n\n\n “…Ma?ne,” says Tuuli, “if you’re riding in the carriage, then you won’t get tired, and you won’t get soaked in the rain, you know? So it’ll be fine if Lutz doesn’t go with you today, won’t it?”\n\n\n Like hell it’ll be fine!!\n\n\n That’s what I want to say, but I can’t win against Tuuli’s pleading stare. There’s no way I can tell her to go walk to work because I’d be in trouble without Lutz there with me. Even just seeing how happy she looked to be able to ride in a carriage gets in the way of that idea. I don’t want to go to Freida’s house by myself, but I just can’t turn her down.\n\n\n “…Yeah, it’ll be fine, Tuuli. You should come with us!”\n\n\n “Thanks, Ma?ne. I’ll go and tell Lutz, so you get ready.”\n\n\n Tuuli, in high spirits, runs off toward’s Lutz’s house, a spring in her step. The sound of her footsteps quickly recedes into the distance, leaving only the tapping of the rain against the shutters. I glare fixedly at Freida, who just used my sister against me to get Lutz excluded.\n\n\n “Freida…”\n\n\n “Your sister seems quite happy, does she not?”\n\n\n “You’re right. …Haahhh, I guess I don’t have a choice. I’m the one that didn’t tell her no, after all.”\n\n\n I was the one who wasn’t able to toss Tuuli aside, so I can’t really blame Freida any more than this. I get my tote bag ready, thinking to myself how angry Lutz and Benno are going to be with me for acting without thinking again.\n\n\n “Sorry,” I say, “but I wasn’t able to get a gift ready for you.”\n\n\n “Oh my, but today you’re giving me a day of your time, are you not? Having the opportunity to speak with you is more than enough.”\n\n\n She laughs airily, looking the very picture of a girl who’s delighted to be able to play with her friend, but I know very well that Freida is no ordinary, innocent little girl.\n\n\n “Ma?ne,” says Tuuli, “I told Auntie Karla about us. C'mon, let’s go! I’m gonna be late.”\n\n\n Tuuli’s smiling face and bouncing gait immediately disperses the gloomy atmosphere hanging between me and Frieda.\n\n\n “Well then, shall we?”\n\n\n We shut the door and head outside. Here, rain gear tends to consist of a thick mantle and a wide-brimmed hat. Of course, this isn’t able to protect perfectly against it, so it gradually gets soaked through if the rain is heavy or you need to be outdoors for too long. Today, though, we’re only going as far as the main street, through narrow alleyways, so I don’t have to worry about getting drenched.\n\n\n “Quickly now, get on.”\n\n\n I hurriedly board the carriage waiting for us at the main road, taking off my hat and mantle and setting them next to me. Freida’s attendant sits outside, next to the driver, leaving just the three of us inside the carriage.\n\n\n “Whoa,” says Tuuli, “is this what a carriage looks like on the inside?”\n\n\n “Come, Tuuli, sit!” says Freida. “Would bringing you to the central plaza work for you?”\n\n\n “Yeah, the place I’m going is on the craftsmen’s road but it’s really close to the plaza.”\n\n\n Freida urges Tuuli to sit as she looks gleefully around the carriage. I sit between the two of them. This carriage looks like it was built to seat two adults, but it fits three children just fine, with a little room to spare. When the carriage starts to move, it shakes and sways just as much as I remember, but unlike the time I’d ridden with Benno and the guild master, I’m sitting in a proper seat, so I don’t think I’m about to be flung into the air.\n\n\n “It’s almost time for the baptismal ceremonies, is it not? Ma?ne, what will you be wearing, perhaps?”\n\n\n “Oh, she’s going to be wearing my hand-me-downs,” says Tuuli, “but we’ve altered it so much that it doesn’t look like a hand-me-down anymore. It looks really extravagant!”\n\n\n Tuuli’s chest swells with pride as she answers Freida’s question for me. During the winter, Tuuli helped our mother with the alterations from time to time, so there’s a few more decorations on the dress then there were before.\n\n\n “…Extravagant?”\n\n\n “I can’t really describe it, but I think it’s got kind of a different feel to it. Mom worked really hard on it, so it’s very cute!”\n\n\n It’s likely that Freida, having just seen the condition of our house, is having trouble imagining what “extravagant” would look like for us. She has an expression of wonder on her face, but we’re really not lying. Plus, there’s a big difference between what people around here usually think “alterations” means and what I did, so it’s difficult to explain.\n\n\n “Your clothing is really fluffy and amazing, too, Freida!” says Tuuli. “I want to try wearing something like that someday…”\n\n\n “Why, thank you very much. So, did you perhaps make yourself a new hairpin?”\n\n\n Freida, happy to hear Tuuli’s compliment, turns the subject towards hairpins. Apart from the one I’d made for Freida, every hairpin so far has been differently-colored variations on the same design. However, it seems like she can’t imagine that me making a hairpin for myself that looks exactly like all of the other ones out there, and is curious about what that might be.\n\n\n “Oh, it’s a gift for her,” says Tuuli, “so I worked really hard on making it. It’s got three big flowers, like the ones we made for you.”\n\n\n “Then, Ma?ne’s hairpin will match mine, perhaps?”\n\n\n Freida looks at me, a little doubtfully, her head tilted to one side. Tuuli seems like she can’t really figure out how to properly explain it, so she tugs on my sleeve, looking troubled.\n\n\n “Well, they’re white, and they sway, so even though the big flower are the same, they don’t really match. Right, Ma?ne?”\n\n\n “We used unbleached thread, so they’re more of a cream color, although from a distance they look white. We’ve added some smaller flowers as well, but there’s still a few more differences between yours and mine. You should look forward to seeing it! Right, Tuuli?”\n\n\n “Yeah, if we tell you all about it now, then you’ll have nothing to look forward to.”\n\n\n Tuuli covers her mouth, hiding an impish grin. Freida looks like she’s been caught up in it, grinning too.\n\n\n “Well, then I really am looking forward to it! I’ll be watching for you outside.”\n\n\n As we talk about the baptismal ceremonies, a row of workshops, where Tuuli works, comes into view around a corner. The carriage comes to a halt, and Tuuli puts on her mantle and hat. She grabs her bag full of tools, then shoots me a brief worried glance.\n\n\n “Do not worry,” says Freida. “I will look after her the very best I can.”\n\n\n “Tuuli,” I say, “good luck at work today!”\n\n\n “Thanks for letting me ride in your carriage, Freida. Ma?ne, I’m off, but don’t cause any trouble!”\n\n\n She gives us a big wave, then takes off running towards the workshop. We wave goodbye, and the carriage starts clattering forward once again.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Welcome, Ma?ne. Glad you could make it. I baked some pound cake today, and I’d love to hear what you think of it.”\n\n\n When we arrive at Freida’s house, Ilse the cook is waiting for us. We’re led to the parlor, where tea and pound cake has been set out for us. I take a bite and immediately start to melt. The moist batter has been baked to a perfect shade of golden brown, and, perhaps because Ilse has adjusted for the oven’s peculiarities, the cake itself is much more delicious than it was last time.\n\n\n “Delicious~… This is way tastier than it was before! You did an excellent job tweaking the recipe.”\n\n\n “I’m happy to hear you say that! I’m curious, can you think of anything to make it even better?”\n\n\n “Improvement? …Ummm, I think it’s delicious enough already, though?”\n\n\n I take another bite of cake, savor its sweet flavor, and ponder for a moment. I know that she could plate it extravagantly when she serves it, or she could change the flavor by adding dried fruits or grated citrus peel, but I also know that just telling her this might be the kind of information provision that would get Benno mad at me.\n\n\n Hmmm, if I do something, Benno will probably get mad, and this really is delicious even if it’s so simple, so there wouldn’t be any problems at all if I were to just stay quiet, but I really do want to help this extremely eager chef to improve her work.\n\n\n “Well, it’s not an improvement, exactly, but… how about I tell you about it in exchange for a bag of sugar?”\n\n\n I recall seeing a bag in the kitchen that looked like it contained about one kilogram of sugar. When I ask for that, Ilse looks over at Freida, who actually has the right to decide.\n\n\n “A bag of sugar… would it be okay to give it to her, Miss Freida?”\n\n\n “Yes, of course.”\n\n\n “Alright, I have the young lady’s permission, so! Tell me!”\n\n\n The sheer ravenous force behind Ilse’s curiosity makes me squeak in momentary fright, but then I open my mouth to speak.\n\n\n “If you grate ferigine peel and add it to the batter, that’ll change both the smell and the taste, and it’ll still be delicious. You could add other things, too, and those will change the flavor as well. As for what exactly to put in and exactly how much, please do some experimentation on your own. I’ll tell you this as a bonus, too: if you’re going to bring this out to serve to nobles, then you could thoroughly whip heavy cream and make a fringe around the edge of the cake, then decorate it with fruit to make it look really extravagant.”\n\n\n “Hm?! I’m going to try that!”\n\n\n Ilse gasps, then immediately stands up and leaves the room. Suddenly left behind, Freida and I blink a few times, then smile wryly.\n\n\n “My apologies, Ma?ne, for showing you, my guest, such a sight. Ilse is usually so calm and composed, but as soon as she sees a new recipe…”\n\n\n “It’s good to be eager to learn. If she tries her hardest, then just that will increase the number of tasty things out there, won’t it?”\n\n\n A zeal for studying is something to be admired. I think that spreading tasty things throughout the world would be a very happy thing, so I definitely want to try experimenting with a lot of different things to try to create new kinds of sweetness.\n\n\n “Come to think of it,” I say, around a big mouthful of pound cake, “why are you apprenticing at the merchants’ guild? Aren’t you going to be opening a shop in the nobles’ quarter? Can you really be an apprentice if you’re not going to actually be an employee?”\n\n\n It’s already been arranged for Freida to go live with the nobility when she grows up, so I hadn’t even considered that she’d be apprenticing at the merchants’ guild.\n\n\n Freida takes a sip of her tea. “It’s something I asked my grandfather for. It’s so that I can both study and make connections for when I’ll be living in the nobles’ quarter. When I open my shop, I’ll be doing so all by myself. I can’t go about thinking that it actually is a job that one person can do on her own, so I need to make as many personal connections as I can.”\n\n\n “All by yourself? You won’t, uh, have any attendants, like Jutte?”\n\n\n “Nobody but myself will be allowed to stay in the nobles’ quarter. Although, when I go there, my partner will have prepared some attendants for me, so it is not like I’ll be living entirely on my own.”\n\n\n Even still, I can’t imagine that any attendants she’ll have in the nobles’ quarter will be at all familiar with economics or business management. Having a young woman who has just barely entered adulthood suddenly stripped of her allies and made to open a shop by her self… isn’t that a little too harsh? Can’t they let her have even one person to consult with?\n\n\n “One person definitely cannot run an entire shop by herself,” she continues. “My family will be allowed in and out of the nobles’ quarter to deliver supplies and the like. They won’t be by my side the entire time, but it’ll be reassuring, will it not?”\n\n\n “…I guess so.”\n\n\n I can’t imagine that it’ll actually be that reassuring, but I can see that Freida is fighting hard for her own destiny, looking straight ahead down her path. I can’t really say anything besides to agree with her. The very grown-up way of thinking and speaking that she’s learned are her weapons and armor. She must keep determinedly polishing them so that she can survive in the unknown world that waits for her.\n\n\n “So, in order to make sure that I am able to handle whatever might occur after I establish my shop, I’m apprenticing with the guild and helping out at my family’s shop.”\n\n\n “You’re amazing, Freida. I can tell that you’re putting a ton of thought into all these things that’ll be happening so far in the future.”\n\n\n When I say that, she immediately gets a very stern expression on her face. She looks at me very seriously, then after a moment of silence, opens her mouth to speak.\n\n\n “There’s something I’d like to ask you as well. May I?”\n\n\n “Sure, go ahead.”\n\n\n Ahh, here it comes, the main question, I think. It’s pretty obvious what she’s about to ask me. I smile, urging her on.\n\n\n “What in the world are you thinking? Ma?ne, by all rights, should you not have extracted yourself from Benno’s employ and come to work with us? I’ve been waiting for you to do this. If you’re seeking connections, then coming here would…”\n\n\n If I were seeking any connections with the nobility, then it would be much better for me to rely on Freida and the guild master than on Benno. This is something Otto pointed out to me as well. I think anyone would realize this. Working at a shop that already has a deep connection with the nobility would of course better my chances of finding a favorable solution, even if only a little. Freida made her offer with a self-confidence that’s grounded in her family’s history and influence. Now, her tone of voice is just a little fiery, and a hint of an unspoken impatience is showing through in her eyes.\n\n\n “Summer is just around the corner, yet you haven’t made any move at all. Have you truly given any thought to what we discussed? If you’re not given to a noble as soon as possible, then the way things are going, you’ll…”\n\n\n Freida’s complaint is based on her concern for me, since I have the same devouring disease that she does. Even if I am brought to a noble, it’s not a guarantee that I’ll be able to immediately form a contract. I actually feel a little self-conscious over how much she’s worrying about me, if her feeling that this needs to be quickly rushed through is being amplified by her overbearing nature.\n\n\n I chuckle, returning Freida’s even stare.\n\n\n “You know, Freida. After thinking about it a lot, I decided that I want to be with my family, even if it means wasting away.”\n\n\n “…Huh?”\n\n\n Freida freezes up, her eyes wide and mouth open. Her lips tremble, just a little, and she weakly mutters, “I can’t believe it…”\n\n\n “I’ve halfway given up already. Since Tuuli started crying, I told her that I’d keep looking for some way to survive somehow, but there’s no other way to live with the devouring except to make a contract with a noble, is there?”\n\n\n I’m sure that the guild leader, in order to save his granddaughter, would have used every scrap of his influence, his money, his connections, and every other useful thing he had to frantically search for every solution he could. He would have bought some time by gathering up magical tools in order to keep searching for any better method than making a contract. Not finding anything, he must have given up on his search and turned towards finding a noble who would grant a contract with the most favorable conditions, thinking that that was the only way forward. The answer is obvious.\n\n\n “…I don’t know of any.”\n\n\n “Honestly, I’ve been wondering if I might be able to find another magical tool somewhere that I could use, but I don’t think I want to make a contract with a noble. There’s no substitute for magical tools if I want to do something about the devouring, is there?”\n\n\n “If I knew of anything, I’d already be using it.”\n\n\n She gives me an irritated glare, and I shrug my shoulders.\n\n\n “I know, right? So, the question I wanted to ask you today is if it’s possible at all to buy magical tools from someone who isn’t a noble? Or maybe, could I make magical tools on my own, or something… that’s not possible, is it?”\n\n\n I was thinking that if I couldn’t find any magical tools then I should try making some myself, but, unfortunately, none of the books I’d read as Urano contained any methods for creating magical tools. These concepts did exist in fantasy novels and games, but I don’t think that I can use any of those as reference material. Also, there’s no workshop here in the city that produces magical tools.\n\n\n “You need mana in order to make magical tools, and since only the nobility have mana, they’re the only ones who can make them. So, the only people who know the methods for making magical tools are behind those castle walls.”\n\n\n “Alright. …I’d been thinking that if I knew how to make them then I could just do it myself, but I guess it really is impossible.”\n\n\n If only mana-possessing nobles could make them, then any workshop for making them would be on the other side of those tall ramparts. I’d been hoping that if I could just learn the manufacturing methods, then I could use all of my funds to make something happen, but I guess I really was just being na?ve, after all.\n\n\n “…I hadn’t even considered making my own,” says Freida.\n\n\n “That’s because you’re from a rich family,” I say, giggling. “In my world, if I decide that I want something, then if I don’t make it myself I won’t ever get it, so the very first thing I thought of was whether or not I could figure out how to make it myself… you know.”\n\n\n Rinsham, paper, soot pencils, and chopsticks were all things that I needed, so I was driven to make them myself, as much as I was able.\n\n\n “Is your family that important to you?” she asks, quietly. “You’re not scared of being swallowed up by the fever?”\n\n\n “Umm, how do I put this. I don’t want to die, but I’m not really scared of it, I don’t think.”\n\n\n I’ve already died once. Being able to live out Ma?ne’s life is just a bonus granted to me by God. I finally managed to make my life actually fun to live, but that opinion hasn’t fundamentally changed.\n\n\n “…I don’t have any books right now, so my family is the only important thing I have. I’m not choosing to die, I’m choosing to be with my family. That’s all.”\n\n\n “Books?”\n\n\n “Yeah. I’ve actually saved up quite a bit of money, so I wonder if I could buy one, maybe?”\n\n\n I tilt my head, pondering, while Freida gives me a worried smile.\n\n\n “If books are what you’re after, then shouldn’t you go to the nobles’ quarter after all? There should be many there, should there not?”\n\n\n “Aaah, if a contract said that I could read books as much as I wanted, then I’d probably sign it on the spot, but do you really think a nobleman that would keep me around as a pet would let a poor commoner like me read something so valuable?”\n\n\n “The more I think about your living conditions, the more difficult they seem.”\n\n\n From a noble’s perspective, I’m just a commoner from a city with a low literacy rate. Even though I know how to read, it still wouldn’t be out of the ordinary for them not to want me to touch any of the expensive, precious books that they themselves own. If I were to read them on my own, then they’d surely get mad. Plus, to a certain extent, I know myself. If there’s a book in front of me, there’s a good chance that I’ll lose all sense of reason. I can easily imagine myself leaping at a book and provoking someone’s wrath.\n\n\n “…So, I’ve been thinking that, until I die, I want to try to set up some way to mass-produce books, but this seems really hard. When I think about how short my lifespan is thanks to the devouring, I get halfway to just giving up. I’m causing so much trouble for my family, so right now I want to earn as much money as I can so that I can leave it behind for them when I’m gone.”\n\n\n As I light-heartedly joke about this, Freida’s light brown eyes suddenly flash with light.\n\n\n “Then, perhaps you’d like to sell me the rights to your pound cake recipe?”\n\n\n I look at Freida, whose eyes definitely have that merchant’s gleam now, and hum thoughtfully to myself. A pound cake is a very basic kind of sweet, but perhaps a time-limited monopoly might not be a big problem. Permanently giving her all the rights, like I did with Benno and the rinsham, would be problematic. It would undoubtedly get in the way of developing and spreading new sweets.\n\n\n “…If I were to ask for five small gold coins for the right to monopolize sales on pound cake for one year, how would that sound?”\n\n\n “I’d take that offer, of course.”\n\n\n She didn’t even hesitate for a moment.\n\n\n “…What do you mean, 'of course’? Did I make it too cheap?”\n\n\n “Yes, that’s right. The rights to monopolize sales on a completely unprecedented new good, like pound cake or plant-based paper, could easily be worth more than a large gold coin.”\n\n\n “A large gold coin…”\n\n\n Once again, it seems like Benno might have conned me into selling him all of my information for dirt cheap.\n\n\n “Would you like to raise the price?”\n\n\n “Nah, that’s fine. It’s only for a year, after all. I’ll sell you monopoly rights for five small gold coins.”\n\n\n I’m not comfortable with raising a price after I already made my offer, so I shake my head.\n\n\n “Well then, let’s write up a contract.”\n\n\n “Huh? You mean, a magical contract?!”\n\n\n Did this just get real scary? Am I going to have to see blood again and put innocent bystanders at risk? I start trembling uncontrollably, but Freida just lets out an amazed sigh.\n\n\n “…Ma?ne. Contract magic is not something that you can use so easily. It’s something that you use when your opponent has both overwhelming magical and political power, putting you at an enormous disadvantage, and you need to use an extremely expensive magical tool in order to secure your profits. In our case, a regular contract written on formal contract parchment would be sufficient, would it not?”\n\n\n “I guess you’re right.”\n\n\n Since my first ever contract was a magical one, I guess my intuition might have been a little skewed. However, if what Freida is saying is correct, then why would Benno use a magical contract with Lutz and I, who possess neither magical nor political power? This is a mystery.\n\n\n “Nevertheless, how do you know about magical contracts, since they’re so rarely used?”\n\n\n “…Mister Benno will get mad if I tell you, so it’s a secret.”\n\n\n “Oh my, you’re learning, aren’t you!”\n\n\n She giggles to herself as she reaches for a bell on a nearby table. When she rings it, Jutte slips into the room, making barely a sound.\n\n\n “Please get a written contract ready for us,” says Freida.\n\n\n On the parchment that Jutte prepares for us, Freida uses a feather pen to outline the terms of our contract. Compared to the wooden pen that I bought, her quill certainly does look impressive, but I wonder if it’s just my imagination that it looks hard to use? To Freida, who is an apprentice at the merchant’s guild, this is ordinary, everyday work. For me, having been here for a while, this is something I’m at least familiar with. After we go over the contract to make sure there’s no discrepancies, we touch our guild cards together to finalize the deal.\n\n\n “Why did you decide on a year?” asks Freida.\n\n\n “After a year, everyone will know that your shop is where pound cake was invented, won’t they? Also, by then, I think sugar will have spread around to more people, so I’m trying to leave some room for new entries into the market.”\n\n\n “New entries?”\n\n\n “If the recipe is announced, then the number of competitors will multiply, and we’ll quickly start seeing new kinds of sweets, won’t we? Delicious sweets make people happy, so if there’s a lot of different people making them, and they start spreading everywhere, then I think that’ll be a good thing.”\n\n\n “Hah, you really don’t care at all about your own profits, Ma?ne. Being a merchant doesn’t suit you.”\n\n\n Freida and I sign our names at the bottom of the contract parchment. With that, the contract between me and Freida to guarantee her monopoly rights for a year is complete.\n\n\n “But, well, me announcing the recipe in a year does require that I’m actually around then, doesn’t it? If I’m not, then I’ll leave that job to you.”\n\n\n “Hmph! I put my own profits above all else. If you want that recipe announced, then you’d better still be here next year to announce it yourself!”\n\n\n She huffs, turning her head away. She looks like she might be on the verge of tears."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The morning of my baptismal ceremony is busy, particularly for my mother. She has to put together breakfast, tidy up after it, and get both her and my father into their only set of nice clothes, so if I were to sleep in or chew sluggishly on my food, she’d get mad at me. Thus, I cram my breakfast down my throat so fast I feel I might choke, and while she’s tidying up I retreat to the bedroom with Tuuli so that I can get changed.\n\n\n Thanks to both Tuuli and my mother gradually making little additions to it here and there, my dress isn’t just fluttery because of the extra fabric that’s been pinned back. The two of them had used their skills at making lacework flowers, honed by a winter’s worth of handiwork, to decorate the dress with little flowers here and there, and now it’s almost excessively decorated. If Benno hadn’t let me keep the leftover thread from our winter handiwork, they probably wouldn’t have had the materials to do this with, I think.\n\n\n My fluttery one piece dress rustles as I pull it on over my head like a t-shirt. I wrap the blue sash around my waist, and tie it tightly into a bow. The ends of it hang limply down past my shins.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, didn’t you have to double that up?” says Tuuli, frowning.\n\n\n I untie the sash, and try wrapping it around myself twice. However, even thought I’d been able to tie it off last winter, it’s just a little bit too short now, so I can’t make it into a good-looking bow.\n\n\n “Huh? Have I been eating too much? Did I get a little chubby?”\n\n\n “Oh, no! You just grew a little bigger.”\n\n\n “Huh? I grew bigger?”\n\n\n “Probably, yeah. Look, we’d made the dress so that it would hang below your knees, but now it’s only halfway down your knees instead. You got a little bigger!”\n\n\n It seems that I’ve gotten a little taller in the space between winter and summer. If I were a normal child, this would be an obvious thing to have happen, but since my devouring is causing me to grow excessively slowly, I’ve never really felt as if I’m growing much at all. I stand there, deeply moved, trembling with joy, but Tuuli is a little more pragmatic. She stares at ends of the sash, contemplating how everything fits together.\n\n\n “…No matter how I look at it, the length just isn’t going to work. It’ll look untidy either way. Maybe we should cut it?”\n\n\n “Oh no,” I say, “that would be a waste. It’ll look fine as it is, so there’s no need to cut it. I’ll just double it up.”\n\n\n “That didn’t work, though?”\n\n\n “I won’t wrap it around myself twice, I’ll just double up the bow.”\n\n\n I wrap the sash around myself, then at my stomach tie a tight, two-fold, butterfly bow. Then, to complete the look, I rotate the sash until the bow is at my back, like when I put on a kimono.\n\n\n “How does it look?” I ask. “Is the length okay?”\n\n\n “So cute! That’s amazing! How did you do that?!”\n\n\n “Umm, well…”\n\n\n As I try to figure out how best to explain it, my mother barges into the room.\n\n\n “If you’re done changing, then get your hair done up. I’m getting changed now.”\n\n\n “Okaay! I’ll tell you later, Tuuli.”\n\n\n I quickly go out to the kitchen and start working on my hair. Last night, my entire family used some rinsham, so today everyone’s hair is smooth and glossy. Unusually, my father had looked like he wanted to be included in this, so I helped wash his hair too. When I tried asking why he was suddenly so interested, he said it was because Otto was bragging about how Corinna had washed his hair. Looks like he was a bit envious of that kind of life satisfaction.\n\n\n “Let me do that for you, Ma?ne.”\n\n\n As I start combing out my hair, Tuuli comes over, her eyes sparkling. It looks like since I’d done her hair for her on the day of her baptismal ceremony, she wanted to return the favor today.\n\n\n “Since you do the twirly thing with your hair ornaments, I can’t help you there, so at least let me comb your hair for you.”\n\n\n “Okay! Thanks.”\n\n\n I hand over the comb and Tuuli gets to work, humming to herself. She seems to be in a really good mood.\n\n\n “Your hair is so straight. It’s really beautiful! It smells good, too.”\n\n\n “Your hair smells the same, you know?”\n\n\n When Tuuli finishes, I thank her, then reach for my hairpin, my hair swaying behind me. I pick up the hairpin, careful not to crush the delicate-looking flowers, and then put my hair up as I usually do. Even if I’d thought about trying a more elaborate hairstyle, my hair can’t really be tied up with a string, so it would all quickly come undone.\n\n\n “Alright then…”\n\n\n Even though I’m using a different hairpin, I’m doing my hair the same way I always do, so I’m done with it almost immediately. This hairpin is somewhat heavier than the simple rod I usually use, and I can tell that whenever I shake my head the little flowers hanging off of it sway back and forth. When I start having a little fun shaking my head a bit, Tuuli claps excitedly.\n\n\n “Whoa, cute!” says Tuuli. “That matches your hair color perfectly! And it’s so wonderful watching it sway whenever you move.”\n\n\n “That suits you very well, Ma?ne,” says my mother.\n\n\n “You look like a princess,” says my dad. “You’ll be the cutest kid at the entire ceremony!”\n\n\n My parents, both finished changing, come out of the bedroom and start complimenting me on how nice I look in my new dress. I’m happy for all of this open, unreserved praise, but it’s also a little embarrassing, too.\n\n\n “Hey, Daddy, isn’t that what you told Tuuli, too?”\n\n\n “Of course it is!” he says, grabbing me and Tuuli in each of his arms. “I’ve got the cutest two daughters in the whole wide world.”\n\n\n Tuuli and I shriek, trying to free ourselves. He cackles, refusing to let us go.\n\n\n “Aaah! You’ll mess up my hair!”\n\n\n “Enough of that!” says my mother. “If you’ve got enough time to fool around, then go and get outside already.”\n\n\n My father immediately lets us go as soon as she says that, but it’s too late. As I catch my breath, my mother looks me over, sighing.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you’ll need to re-do your hair,” she says.\n\n\n “Sorry ‘bout that,” says my father, shrugging apologetically.\n\n\n I smile at him, then pull out my hairpin, shake out my hair, stick it back in, and fix it. Sure, my hair can’t ever be done in any sort of extremely elaborate hairdo, but thanks to its peculiar smoothness, even if it gets a little ruffled all it takes is a little bit of hand combing to sort it back out.\n\n\n “Looks like everyone’s starting to gather outside,” says Tuuli, opening the front door wide and waving us over. We go downstairs and head out into the plaza around the well, where many of our neighbors have already started to gather.\n\n\n “Oh, there’s Ralph and the others. Looks like Lutz is wearing Ralph’s hand-me-downs, too.”\n\n\n I look over at where she’s pointing, and see Lutz, indeed wearing Ralph’s nicest hand-me-downs, surrounded by a large number of people. Since I didn’t actually see Ralph on his baptismal day, I wouldn’t have been able to tell that they were hand-me-downs if I hadn’t been told, though. Lutz is wearing a white shirt and pants, with a light blue sash tied around his waist. If I had to guess, this was probably made for Zasha, the oldest child in the family. Both the sash and the embroidery look like they’d match Zasha a lot better.\n\n\n “Lutz—”\n\n\n “Oh my, Ma?ne?! What is with that dress?! You look like a very rich little girl, don’t you!”\n\n\n Before I can get to him, Auntie Karla catches me. Her loud, resounding voice quickly draws the attention of everyone around us.\n\n\n “They’re Tuuli’s hand-me-downs,” I say.\n\n\n “Those are hand-me-downs?!”\n\n\n “Yeah. It was way too loose around the shoulders, so we gathered it up here and here and added straps, then there was extra cloth on the sides so we added some pleats here, and then it was too long so we rolled it up and sewed it in place. That’s all, just some really simple alterations.”\n\n\n As I give a quick explanation, the nearby women all gather round, jostling each other as they try to get a better look. Since I’m far shorter than the average child of my age, they all have to stoop down to see. Being surrounded by all these people staring down at me from above is actually a little scary. I unconsciously reach behind me and grab tightly to my mother’s skirt.\n\n\n “Hmm! This doesn’t look like it was an alteration at all. It looks quite splendid!”\n\n\n “Oh, let me see! Aha, I see, you could do this because Tuuli and Ma?ne are so different in build. That won’t work in our family…”\n\n\n “Ahahah, I’d thought the sash was a bit extravagant, but it was too long so you had to double it up, didn’t you?”\n\n\n As all these people are chattering amongst themselves however they like, they occasionally throw a “congratulations” or a “happy baptism day” at me, but they all feel very perfunctory.\n\n\n “And this hairpin! It’s so elaborate, isn’t it? This must have been so expensive.”\n\n\n When they point out how pricey my hairpin must have been, my mother just laughs, shaking her head.\n\n\n “We made it ourselves, so it wasn’t very expensive at all. Since I was able to alter this dress to fit her, I had all sorts of thread leftover that I thought I’d need in order to make her own dress, so we used that.”\n\n\n “Really? My daughter said that she’d wanted me to buy her one of these for her baptism. Do you think you could teach me how to make them?”\n\n\n “You’ll need some very, very fine needles to make it work. If you can get a pair of those, the rest is easy.”\n\n\n I hadn’t expected her to interrupt at all! She’s managed to redirect everyone’s attention towards herself. Now that she’s the one getting flooded with questions, I quietly manage to slip away through the crowd of older women. Looks like having just a slightly different dress and a slightly different hairpin really did make me the target of a lot of interest after all.\n\n\n Alright, escape complete.\n\n\n The instant I let myself breathe a sigh of a relief, however, I immediately find myself surrounded by a ton of girls interested in both my clothes and my hairpin. These are all slightly older girls, who’d already had their baptisms by the time I was finally able to go to the forest. Aside from Tuuli, I didn’t really have any contact with these people.\n\n\n “Aaah, so cute!!”\n\n\n “Let me see, let me see! Whoa, Tuuli made this, right? Amazing!”\n\n\n A girl who seems like she’s spent some time with Tuuli rudely grabs at my hairpin. It smoothly slides out and my hair falls down around me.\n\n\n “Ah!”\n\n\n “Oh, I’m, I’m sorry! What do I do…”\n\n\n She turns green, clutching my hairpin, mortified that she’d just destroyed a hairstyle that must have taken ages to put together. I hold out my hand, though, smiling sweetly.\n\n\n “It’s okay! I can fix it.”\n\n\n She gives me my hairpin back, and I get to work fixing my hair. I quickly comb it out, wrap it tightly around the pin, and with a twist, secure it in place.\n\n\n “Huh? What? What did you just do?! That’s no ordinary decoration, is it?”\n\n\n “Eh heh heh,” says Tuuli, “It’s just a decoration, yet it can hold hair in place. My little sister is really amazing, after all!”\n\n\n Tuuli, for some reason, puffs up her chest proudly. After that, everyone takes turns admiring my two-fold bow and pinching my dress here and there, all the while Tuuli triumphantly explains everything. Everyone seems to be having a lot of fun, but ultimately everything they’re saying and doing is exactly what the older women had been saying and doing too.\n\n\n I somehow slip away from that crowd as well, and breathe another sigh. Now that I’m finally not surrounded by so many unfamiliar faces, I suddenly realize just how tired I am. I start heading towards Lutz, hoping to find some place to take a breather.\n\n\n “Lu~utz…”\n\n\n “Oh, Ma?ne! Looks like you finally got away from Mom—”\n\n\n He turns around to look at me and suddenly freezes.\n\n\n “Hm? What’s wrong?”\n\n\n “Uh, nothing. Umm—”\n\n\n “Whoa, what’s with that dress? That looks totally different from Tuuli’s.”\n\n\n Ralph appears, pushing Lutz aside.\n\n\n “We just altered Tuuli’s dress from bef— gaah! Zasha, put me down!”\n\n\n “Congratulations, Ma?ne! You’re so tiny and cute. Way cuter than cheeky Lutz here!”\n\n\n “Ma?ne, happy baptism. That dress really suits you! But, man, you’re really tiny. You barely even look like you should be getting baptized today, huh?”\n\n\n “I’ve gotten a little bigger! Not that you’d be able to tell, though!”\n\n\n I’d sought out Lutz so I could finally relax, but now I’m surrounded by all of his older brothers. Lutz flushes red with embarrassment, and chases his brothers off.\n\n\n “Oh no, Zasha! Ma?ne’s looking kinda ill!”\n\n\n “Whoa, Ma?ne. Hang in there. The ceremony hasn’t even started, right?!”\n\n\n Still held in Zasha’s arms, I let myself go limp. Zasha, who’ll come of age next year, already has the kind of stability a full-grown adult would have.\n\n\n “I wanna go home…” I whine.\n\n\n “We haven’t even left,” says Lutz.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The temple bells start to ring in the distance, their rhythmic chiming resounding through the town. It’s the signal that it’s time to head towards the temple. Out of all of our neighbors who use the same well we do, the only children getting baptized this season are Lutz and myself. The two of us are quickly surrounded by cheering adults.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, let’s go! Onwards to the main street!”\n\n\n With a jerk, my father lifts me out of Zasha’s arms and takes off towards the main street, at the head of the pack. After a moment, Lutz frantically chases after us. Over my father’s shoulder, I can see our families, as well as the other adults, following behind. In the street ahead, just like when Tuuli had her ceremony, I see children emerging from alleyways here and there, followed by their families. Then, crowds of spectators start pouring out, until the edges of the street are covered in people.\n\n\n “Are you okay, Ma?ne?” asks my father.\n\n\n “Umm… maybe?”\n\n\n In the distance, I can hear the sound of cheering grow louder. It seems like the procession is drawing near.\n\n\n “Rest until we get you to the temple,” he says.\n\n\n “Okay, I will. Thanks, Daddy.”\n\n\n It seems like my father will be carrying me all the way to the temple. After all, I can’t walk at the speed everyone else will be going at, and if I collapse in the middle of the procession, the whole thing will be ruined.\n\n\n Behind the slowly-growing column of children dressed in white, their families follow behind. It looks like my father is going to try to put himself right at the end of the line of children, in the front row of parents. However, if Lutz stands here with us, he probably won’t be able to see anything but the people immediately around him.\n\n\n “Lutz, do you want to go on ahead?”\n\n\n “Nah, if we’re split up, then when we get to the temple I’d have to search for you, so I’ll stay here.”\n\n\n “Then, maybe you could walk near the edge? So that you can see Mister Benno’s shop on our way past.”\n\n\n “…Yeah, good idea.”\n\n\n As I watch, the procession starts to pass us by. My father steps forward, me held in his arms, and Lutz follows us, joining the procession. From my tall vantage point, I can see everything around me, unlike during Tuuli’s ceremony, when I’d been completely buried. On both sides of the main street, people are waving hugely at us, whistling shrilly, and showering us with blessings. The windows of the buildings that overlook the streets have been thrown open wide, and groups of people lean out of each, shouting congratulations down at us. The children ahead of us smile widely, filled to bursting with pride, and wave back at the people along the streets and in the windows.\n\n\n “Ma?ne,” says my father, “make sure you wave back at everyone. You’re saying thanks.”\n\n\n “Oh, I see!”\n\n\n With my father’s prompting, I let go of him with one of my arms, and, with a smile, start to wave. I try to pattern my waving after the way members of the Imperial Family back in Japan would respond to cheers with their gentle smiles.\n\n\n Yes, just like that! With elegance and grace!\n\n\n Even if I had the determination, this isn’t the kind of smiling or waving that I could suddenly figure out how to do on my own, but if I have something to model it after, then copying that isn’t a problem at all. Plus, in this town, there’s nobody to laugh at me for mimicking the Imperial Family. So, I smile as elegantly as I possibly can, and wave my hand in the most gentle, elegant manner that I can muster.\n\n\n Whoa, people are pointing, am I standing out too much?!\n\n\n I don’t know if it’s because being carried by my father makes me too conspicuous or not, but I feel like I might be attracting too much attention. But, since everyone’s looking at the procession, I don’t think there’s any way that I’m the only one drawing attention here, though.\n\n\n “Ma?ne,” says my father, “my arm’s getting a little tired. I’m going to switch.”\n\n\n “Okay,” I reply.\n\n\n While we wait in the central plaza for the processions from the other streets to arrive, my father shifts his posture. I’ve already seen everything up until this point during Tuuli’s ceremony. After everyone has gathered in the central plaza, we’ll start proceeding towards the temple that sits in front of the castle ramparts.\n\n\n From the central plaza, I can see that the temple is a building made of white stone that stands taller than the city’s outer walls. In fact, it’s as tall as the castle ramparts themselves. It’s a large, splendid building, but between the long, narrow windows that line its surface and the fact that it’s built so that it’s almost jutting out from the castle walls themselves, I can’t help but wonder if it was originally used as a fortress or if it was even part of the castle walls themselves.\n\n\n Hmm, although, did they really take a building designed for soldiers to use and use it for religious purposes instead? In wartime, the temple probably sends out people to provide aid, but in ordinary times, they could probably build something like that with all the offerings, donations, and whatever other ways they could squeeze money out of their believers…\n\n\n Since the only knowledge that I can base any of this speculation off of is what I know from Japan, no matter how much I think about it I can’t actually be sure of anything. However, up until now, I haven’t really thought at all about this institution they call “the temple”, and haven’t seen anything that even remotely resembles its architectural style or appearance, so it’s kind of fun to try to puzzle my way around it.\n\n\n Now that everyone’s gathered, we start proceeding towards the temple. From this point on, both the people along the sides of the road as well as the children who join the procession are wearing noticeably different things. It’s clear that the cloth itself is worth a lot of money, and even though the outfits are still basically all white, the cuffs and hems are all lavishly embroidered.\n\n\n After we walk a little ways, Benno’s shop comes into sight. Lined up in front, I can see Benno, Mark, Otto, and Corinna, all surrounded by other familiar faces from the shop.\n\n\n “Lutz, I can see Mister Benno and Mister Mark! Mister Otto and Miss Corinna are there too to congratulate us.”\n\n\n “Seriously?”\n\n\n Unlike me, who can see at the same level of my father, Lutz is in the middle of the procession, so it seems like he still can’t see Benno’s shop. When he finally spots it, he grins hugely and waves. Mark waves back, and all of the other employees follow suit, all shouting out as one.\n\n\n “Lutz, Ma?ne, congratulations!”\n\n\n I’m a little startled to suddenly stand out so much, but I’m thrilled to be congratulated by everyone, and I give them a huge wave back. With my spirits as high as they are, there isn’t a trace of Imperial dignity left. Otto embraces Corinna with his left hand and waves at us with his right. Corinna waves at us as well, smiling gently.\n\n\n “Make sure you stop by to say thanks on your way back from the temple,” says my father to Lutz, reaching down to ruffle his hair as he walks beside us.\n\n\n The two of us, of course, nod emphatically.\n\n\n “Hey, Ma?ne,” says Lutz. “Do you think Master Benno looks a little shocked?”\n\n\n “You noticed it too, huh?”\n\n\n Amidst all of his broadly smiling and waving employees, Benno stands alone, staring at us, rubbing his temples and scowling.\n\n\n Hmmm, knowing Benno, isn’t that the same look he gives me whenever I do something really unnecessary? Did I somehow do something wrong again?\n\n\n We draw closer and closer to the temple, and the details of the white building I’d been observing from far away slowly start to come into view. Reliefs have been carved along the walls, and on both sides of the entrance there are four statues carved of stone lined up. Whether these are statues of this city’s gods or just ordinary decorations, I can’t really say.\n\n\n While my vision was occupied by the sight of the front of the procession starting to enter the temple, we’d started pass Freida’s house. The guild master and his family have all taken positions along the side of the street. I even see Ilse and Jutte there too.\n\n\n “Congratulations, Ma?ne!”\n\n\n “Thank you!”\n\n\n The people I know call out to me, waving. I wave back at them, and yell back.\n\n\n “Freida!”\n\n\n The guild master has Freida in his arms, like my father is carrying me. She looks a little shocked as she smiles and waves back at me.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you look wonderful!” she yells. Amongst all of the cheering, I can just barely hear her.\n\n\n Before the several stairs that lead into the temple, guardsmen stand, looking imposing. They wear blue clothing underneath what appear to be simple pieces of armor. I can see fine ornamentation on it, and it is polished to the point where it gleams in the light. Coupled with the fact that their clothing is glossy as well, it seems clear that even this is ceremonial.\n\n\n The enormous double doors loom over us, towering taller than two grown men. Both the doors and the thick wooden gate they’re set into, are crafted expertly and carved intricately. The gates have been opened wide, and beyond them I can see a long white stone plaza stretching ahead. At the end of it is a large, five-story building, and to either side are smaller three-story buildings, all tied together by walkways. All three buildings are built from the same white stone, but only the one in the center has been decorated with carvings and reliefs.\n\n\n “Well, this is as far as parents go. Lutz, take care of Ma?ne for me.”\n\n\n “Yeah, leave it to me.”\n\n\n My father sets me down. I take Lutz’s hand, and we walk, at the tail end of the procession, towards the enormous doors. As even the most loudly excited kids start to quiet down as soon as we pass through the doors, the noise gradually starts to abate.\n\n\n “Hey, Ma?ne.”\n\n\n Lutz’s voice reverberates much more than I expected. I turn to look at him. “What?” I say, keeping my voice down, leaning in close as if I’m trying to hear a secret. Lutz keeps looking forward, but leans closer to my ear, and speaks in little more than a whisper.\n\n\n “That dress and that hairpin really suit you. You’re shockingly cute.”\n\n\n When everyone else praised me like that, I always just smiled back and thanked them as normal, but somehow, having this whispered into my right before entering a temple destroys my usual reaction.\n\n\n “Um? Uh? Why, now…”\n\n\n I instinctively look up at him, and see him smiling a genuine smile, as if he hadn’t a care in the world.\n\n\n “My brothers said it before I could back there, so I figured I should wait until they weren’t around.”\n\n\n “Ah… oh… is that it? Then, thank you!”\n\n\n I put one hand on my chest to try and still my leaping heart, and, holding hands, Lutz and I walk together into the temple.\n\n\n Since we’re the last people through, even if nobody could hear what we were saying our entire exchange was visible to the people behind us. The fact that the crowd behind us had yelled “wow, cute! It’s like they’re getting married,” and my father had been gnashing his teeth as he saw us off is something I only learn after the ceremony is over."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The shrill voices of the children who entered before us echo throughout the temple, ringing so loudly within the walls that I feel a headache coming on. I stop walking, unintentionally, and Lutz tugs gently on my hand, pulling me forward.\n\n\n “Watch your step, there’s some stairs,” he says.\n\n\n “Okay,” I reply.\n\n\n As I take a few steps forward, watching my step, I hear a heavy groaning sound from behind me as the doors start to close. Startled by the shadow suddenly passing beneath me, I turn around to see gray-robed priests pushing the doors shut.\n\n\n “Ah, that’s right, we were the last ones through, so…”\n\n\n When the doors are shut tight, a blue-robed priest slowly walks in front of it. He waves some sort of wind chime-like bell, attached to which is a strangely-colored stone. It jingles. In the next instant, the voices of the other children disappear, as do their echoes, leaving only the faintest ringing that quickly fades to silence.\n\n\n “What was that…?”\n\n\n Lutz’s voice doesn’t come out. Or, more accurately, nothing more than a whisper comes out. Judging by his facial expression and posture, I think he’d tried to speak in a normal tone of voice, louder than what actually came out. He looks shocked at how little sound he made, touching his throat.\n\n\n “Maybe it’s a magical tool?” I say. “It happened as soon as that blue priest rang that bell.”\n\n\n As I expected, my voice doesn’t come out any louder than a whisper either. However, since I’d seen the moment the priest rang the bell, I was able to figure out what had happened and stay calm. When I say this, Lutz relaxes, breathing a sigh of relief. Now that he knows it’s not just him, and that there was a reason for it, he calms himself down.\n\n\n I sigh in admiration, then face forward again, looking along the long line of the procession ahead of us. The interior of the temple is like an atrium, long and with a high ceiling. The walls on both sides of the room are covered in intricate carvings, and thick, round pillars are lined up regularly along them. Tall windows, stretching nearly four stories high, line the walls in even intervals, letting long, straight shafts of light into the room. Both the walls and the pillars are white, with the exception of gold ornamentation here and there, and even in the dim light they still seem bright. The only place rich with color is the far end of the room.\n\n\n Unlike the Christian churches I’d seen in collections of photographs and art museums, there are no frescoes or stained glass windows. The white stone construction makes the room feel very unlike a Shinto shrine or Buddhist temple, and the colors don’t match any of the vibrant shades from southeast Asia.\n\n\n On the innermost wall, a multicolored mosaic stretches from the floor all the way to the ceiling, bearing an intricate pattern. It glimmers where it’s hit by sunlight from the side, reminding me just a little bit of a mosque for a moment, but there are stairs, too, over forty of them, going from the floor to nearly the height of the window. The stone statues that are arranged on the way up only reinforce how alien this all is.\n\n\n Perhaps these stairs are meant to evoke the idea of climbing towards heaven and the gods? Something about the statues lined up at the top of the stairs remind me of the dolls we put out for Girls’ Day, though…2\n\n\n On the upper-most stair, there are two statues next to each other, one man and one woman. Based on how they’re arranged, they give me the impression that they’re a married pair. Between that and the fact that they’re on the highest stair, I think they’re probably the highest-ranked gods in this religion. Even though they’re made of white stone, the male god is draped in a glittering black mantle set with countless golden stars, and the female goddess wears a golden crown, with long, tapered spines coming off of it like rays of light.\n\n\n Perhaps this is the goddess of light and god of darkness? Or perhaps the goddess of the sun and the god of the night? Either way, the mantle and the crown stand out.\n\n\n A few steps below that, there’s a stone statue of a slightly plump, gentle-looking woman, holding a golden chalice that glitters with gemstones. Below her, there’s a woman holding a staff, a man holding a spear, a woman holding a shield, and a man holding a sword. They’re all made of the same white stone, but the fact that they’re each holding just one brightly-colored item makes this even more mysterious to me. These statues were made to hold real things; is there some meaning to that?\n\n\n Something like a Holy Grail or a Holy Sword, perhaps?\n\n\n On the steps below that, there are flowers, fruits, bundles of cloth, and other offerings laid out. The more I look, the more it really does remind me of Girls’ Day.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, don’t just stand and stare, keep walking!”\n\n\n “Hm? Oh! Sorry, sorry.”\n\n\n Lutz tugs me forward, and I hurry a little bit to keep up with the end of the procession. The path down the center of the room is clear so that we can walk though, but on either side thick red carpets are spread out, spaced about one meter apart from each other.\n\n\n At the front of the room, there are a number of desks, where a number of priests garbed in blue seem to be performing some sort of procedure. The children who finish going through that procedure are guided by gray-clothed priests to either side of the room. They’re led to spots on the carpet, from the outside of the walls in, and told to take their shoes off before sitting down.\n\n\n As the procession slowly makes its way forward, either something happens or Lutz notices something new. “Geh,” he says, grimacing, as he looks ahead at whatever he’s seeing.\n\n\n “What’s wrong, Lutz? Is something happening at the front?”\n\n\n “…Ahh…”\n\n\n After waffling for a moment, as if he’s trying to figure out how to say something difficult, he lets out a defeated sigh, then looks over at me.\n\n\n “It’s a blood seal, like you hate.”\n\n\n “Wh… what?”\n\n\n “Some kind of magical tool, I think. Everyone’s thumbs are getting pricked and they’re pushing their blood onto it.”\n\n\n I’d much rather I hadn’t heard that, but now there’s nothing left for me to do but do a sharp about-face and immediately get right out of there. Lutz, however, grabs my hand tightly and refuses to let me go.\n\n\n “Give up,” he says. “This looks like some sort of registration thing. I’d bet this is related to that citizenship thing, right?”\n\n\n “Urgh… yeah, you’re right. I think that’s probably it.”\n\n\n Otto and Benno had both told me that after my baptismal ceremony was over, I’d be acknowledged as a resident of this town and granted citizenship rights. In other words, if I can’t get through this ritual, no matter how bad it may be, then I can’t get my citizenship.\n\n\n “…Why do magical tools like blood so much?” I ask.\n\n\n “Dunno,” he replies.\n\n\n Every single time I have to use a magic tool, it involves cutting open my finger and making blood on it. No matter how many times I do it, I’ll never be able to get used to the pain of it. When I look ahead to see what the other children are going through, I see brusque blue-robed priests jabbing their fingers with needles, then pushing those fingers firmly into what look like medallions of flat white stone. Those kids have their mouths open in what look like screams of pain, but I can’t hear anything coming from them at all. Seeing them clutching their sore fingers while being lead away towards the carpets has me trembling in fear.\n\n\n “Next please, this way,” says a priest.\n\n\n The line of people in front of me has thinned out, and a voice calls out from one of the empty desks. Lutz pushes me forward, and I start heading towards where I’m being called. The blue-robed priest smiles at me a little, looking me up and down, and then holds out his hand.\n\n\n “Please hold out your hand, palm up. I’m going to prick your finger, but it’ll only hurt a little bit.”\n\n\n Of course, the thing he said wouldn’t hurt does, in fact, hurt. The instant the needle pricks my finger, I feel a sharp pain, like being poked by something very hot, and a fat, red drop of blood wells up on my fingertip. Between the pain and seeing my blood, I can feel myself going deathly pale.\n\n\n “Smear that blood on here, if you would.”\n\n\n Unlike the priest I’d seen earlier, who’d been roughly forcing kids’ fingers into place, this priest just guides my hand over to a small medallion-like object. It seems like just gently smearing my blood onto its surface was good enough, leaving me relieved that the process wasn’t nearly as painful as I thought it would be.\n\n\n I’m glad that this priest wasn’t anywhere near as violent, but my finger still really stings!\n\n\n I wonder, had that magical tool that had been used to quiet us down not actually been used to stop our chattering from resounding through the temple, but to stop our screams of agony?\n\n\n “You two are the last ones through. This way, please.”\n\n\n We’re called over by a gray-robed priest who, despite being an adult, seems to still have a little immaturity left in him. Lutz and I start walking towards the carpet. After being instructed to take of our shoes, we do so, and then sit down on the carpet. Amongst all of the kids who are either sitting cross-legged or with their feet splayed out in front of them, I’m the only one sitting with my legs propped up, like I’m back in PE class in elementary school3. Being in such a wide-open, gymnasium-like space, surrounded by other children my age, makes me feel like this is the only correct way to be sitting.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, why’re you curled into a ball like that?”\n\n\n “It’s not a ball, it’s a triangle,” I explain. “It’s called triangular sitting.”\n\n\n “Huh? A triangle? Where?”\n\n\n “Like this,” I say, gesturing.\n\n\n As the two of us chat, the blue-robed priests, having finished registering everyone, collectively step back behind the desks. After they carry all of the boxes that they had been putting our registration medallions in out of the room, the gray-robed priests burst into action, bustling about as they start getting ready for the next phase. They carry out the desks, and in its place they bring out a much more extravagant altar and place it in front of the steps.\n\n\n The blue-robed priests come back into the room, lining themselves up on either side of the altar, and at roughly the same time the gray-robed priests line up along the walls where we’re sitting, seemingly finished with their preparation work. The way they’re standing behind us reminds me of teachers keeping watch over students at a school assembly, and I take extra care to make sure I’m sitting up properly in my triangle.\n\n\n “The head priest enters,” intone the blue-robed priests, waving the rods they’re holding. The sound of countless bells rings out, and an old man, dressed in white robes with a golden sash crossing his shoulder, slowly enters the room, carrying something. With careful, deliberate footsteps, he makes his way to the altar, upon which he gently sets the thing he was carrying.\n\n\n Is… that… a book?!\n\n\n I rub frantically at my eyes in disbelief, looking again and again to make sure that my eyes aren’t deceiving me. When I see the head priest start to slowly turn the pages, I’m convinced. That is, beyond the shadow of any doubt, a book. It feels like a bible, or some other form of holy scriptures.\n\n\n “Lutz, a book! That’s a book!”\n\n\n I poke him excitedly on the shoulder. He had been fidgeting constantly, unused to sitting on the ground. He cranes his neck to see.\n\n\n “Where? Where do you see it?”\n\n\n “Look, there, the thing the head priest is holding. That!”\n\n\n It looks like it is bound in leather, and the easily-damaged corners are reinforced with finely-worked gold. I can see from here that it’s studded with small gemstones, as well.\n\n\n “That’s a book? Whoa, that looks expensive. That’s nothing like the one that you’ve been making.”\n\n\n “There’s not a whole lot in common between a book like that, which has a lot of artistic value, and what I’m making, which is mostly practical. It’s like comparing the sword that that statue is carrying to your knife.”\n\n\n “Ahh, I see. Even so, aren’t you surprised to see something like that here?”\n\n\n “…I’m not surprised at all, actually. If you think about it, it’s actually pretty obvious.”\n\n\n As an ordinary Japanese woman with no particularly strong interest in religion, I’d never even considered going near the temple, but in a religious institution like this, there would of course be some way to collect all of the scripture, holy texts, bibles, and various teachings in one place. There would be books. Even if my body doesn’t let me move the way I want, even if I didn’t have any money, even if I didn’t desperately try to make them myself, books definitely exist.\n\n\n If the merchant’s guild is on the cutting edge of gathering information, then the temple must be on the cutting edge of theology, mathematics, music, arts, and all of the other fields of study that could bring them closer to the gods. The Christian church had fostered scholarship like that, and in Japan Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines had been places where people gathered to learn from leading intellectuals.\n\n\n “Aaaaaargh, I should have come here earlier! Why didn’t I think of this?! I’m such an idiot! I could have been reading books without going through all this trouble!!”\n\n\n It’s probably for the best that my voice isn’t getting any louder no matter how much I scream. As I cry out from deep in my heart, Lutz looks at me in amazement, then just shrugs his shoulders.\n\n\n “So, it looks like you’ve completely forgotten, but they don’t let kids who haven’t gone through their baptismal ceremonies into the temple, you know? Even if you’d thought of it right away and come here, the gatekeepers wouldn’t have let you in.”\n\n\n Now that he mentions it, he’s right. The only children who can enter the temple are those who’ve already been baptized.\n\n\n “But, to just happen to go to the temple and come across a book on the day of my own baptismal ceremony, couldn’t that be fate?”\n\n\n “Everybody goes to the temple when they turn seven, Ma?ne. Fate has nothing to do with it.”\n\n\n “Ugh, Lutz! Stop picking everything apart like that!”\n\n\n “I know you’re excited about there being a book here, but calm down. It’ll be a big problem if you pass out here.”\n\n\n Lutz seems to think I’m a little too excited and is trying to calm me down.\n\n\n “Huh? But, there’s a book so close. Not getting even a little bit excited is completely impossible, you know?”\n\n\n “Even if it’s impossible, you have to. I mean, that’s not a book that they’d ever let you read, right?”\n\n\n “Ah… that’s right.”\n\n\n Even though there’s a book, it’s not a book that I can ever touch. There’s no way that I’d ever be allowed to read a book wrapped in leather and studded with gemstones. As soon as I realize this, my excitement quickly dissipates, and my head drops dejectedly.\n\n\n “Today, you are all now seven years old, and you have been recognized as citizens of this town. Congratulations.”\n\n\n Although the head priest seems quite old, he still has a powerful voice that reverberates through the temple. After opening with his congratulations, he then proceeds to start reading aloud from the book in his clear voice. It sounds like some sort of scriptures. I, with my entire heart seized firmly by the book, lean forward in anticipation.\n\n\n The contents of the scriptures are similar to what Benno had told me a while ago, about the creation of the world and the changing of the seasons. The priest is reciting it in simpler words that are easy for children to understand.\n\n\n “For a long, long time, so long that we can’t even imagine it, the god of darkness lived in total solitude.”\n\n\n After that, he met the goddess of the sun, a bunch of things happened, they got married, had many children—among them, the goddess of water, the god of fire, the goddess of wind, and the god of earth—, and created the world we live in, or so the story goes. The “bunch of things happened” part seems like it was abbreviated for our sakes, but it sounds very soap-opera-like to me.\n\n\n Myths are like that, though. All of the myths I know are all chaotic like that. Now’s not the time for snark.\n\n\n Just hearing a new story is already fun, but comparing it to the other myths I already know while I only makes it even more interesting. Lutz, however, doesn’t seem to be interested, nor does he seem to know how this could possibly be fun. He rocks back and forth restlessly, looking enviously over at me.\n\n\n “You look like you’re having fun,” he says.\n\n\n “Yeah, tons,” I reply.\n\n\n “What’s fun about it?”\n\n\n “The beginning, the end, and all the bits in between!”\n\n\n I answer him with an enormous smile. He looks at me, amazed, then sighs, shaking his head.\n\n\n “…Alright. That’s good.”\n\n\n “Yeah!”\n\n\n After the creation myth came the story about the changing of the seasons. I’d already heard the basics of this from Benno: “Spring is the season of water, where the melting snow causes sprouts to grow. Summer is the season of fire, where the heat of the sun causes the leaves to unfurl. Fall is the season of wind, where the cooling air causes the fruits to ripen. Winter is the season of earth, when all life sleeps.” The actual myth itself, however, is different.\n\n\n “The goddess of earth was the firstborn child of the goddess of the sun and the god of darkness. At that time, the god of life took one look at her and instantly fell in love and asked her father, the god of darkness, for her hand in marriage. The god of darkness thought that their marriage would bear many children and was pleased by this proposal, so he granted the god of life’s request at the two were married.”\n\n\n So the myth of the season begins. Lutz, however, yawns, seeming to find this entire thing immensely tedious, so I think I’d rather explain it in digest form.\n\n\n To put it simply, the god of life turned out to be more than a little bit crazy. He locked her in a prison of snow and ice and raped her until she got pregnant, and then even got jealous of the unborn children. Winter is the season of plunder and of nothing being born.\n\n\n The goddess of the sun got worried that she hadn’t seen the goddess of earth ever since she got married, so she melted the ice. The crazy god was worn out after having been able to copulate as much as he wanted, so the water goddess washed all of the snow and ice away, freeing her friend and sister. Spring is the season where the two of them worked together to help seeds, the earth goddess’s children, sprout.\n\n\n The god of fire then lent his power, making summer the season where the budding life grew to ripeness. However, after that, the crazy god regained his strength and started looking for the earth goddess. Fall is the season where the goddess of winds put all her power into making sure the crazy god couldn’t get anywhere near her sister, while helping to ensure that the harvest is finished.\n\n\n Then, when the brothers and sisters were finally exhausted, it was the crazy god’s turn. Once again, he locks up and rapes the earth goddess. Her siblings want to kill the crazy god even more, but if they do that, then no new life can ever be born, so they cannot. So, caught in this irreconcilable dilemma, the siblings are forced to wait through the winter, gathering their strength.\n\n\n This back-and-forth forms the endless loop of the seasons, it seems. This is a myth that’s as full of opportunities for snark as every other.\n\n\n Incidentally, since the children here were born in the summer, our guardian deity is the zealous, hot-blooded god of the sun, and we have divine favor relating to guidance and rearing children. With that, the head priest concludes his talk of the gods and closes the book.\n\n\n “Now then, I shall teach you how to worship the gods. If you offer your prayers and gratitude to the gods, then they will surely grant you greater divine favor.”\n\n\n He wears a very serious expression as he says this, slowly walking out from behind the altar. While he does this, gray-robed priests quickly unroll carpets in front of the blue-robed priests.\n\n\n The head priest stands in the center of the room, with a line of ten blue-robed priests behind them.\n\n\n “Now then, before you try it yourself, watch closely. …We pray to the gods!”\n\n\n As he says this, the head priest opens his arms out wide, raises his left knee high, and looks up towards the heavens.\n\n\n “Snrk!”\n\n\n I quickly clap a hand over my mouth, clamping down on my sudden outburst. It is absolutely not okay to spontaneously burst out laughing in the middle of a sacred temple. I am fully aware of this. However, no matter how much I may try to remind myself of this, I am filled with the undeniable urge to start laughing out loud. My stomach is seizing up.\n\n\n I mean, that’s the Glico pose4!\n\n\n They’re doing the Glico pose! With a straight face! Why Glico?! You don’t need to lift your leg like that, right?! You’re an old man, you shouldn’t be standing on one leg like that! It’s dangerous!\n\n\n I can keep myself from laughing too rudely here. This man is keeping himself perfectly balanced in such a crisp pose. I must just be fixating on the joke. I’m confident that no matter what else this man does, I’ll be able to bear it.\n\n\n The head priest slowly places his foot on the ground and lowers his arms, looking like he’s doing Tai Chi. If that had been all, I would have been able to keep myself under control, but does this old man have some sort of grudge against my aching sides?\n\n\n “We give thanks to the gods!”\n\n\n With elegant movements, like flowing water, the head priest transitions from the Glico pose to the dogeza, getting on his hands and knees and pressing his forehead into the floor. Seeing this is too much to bear. A strange noise bursts out of my mouth.\n\n\n “Beheh!”\n\n\n “Ma?ne, what’s wrong? Are you feeling okay?”\n\n\n “I’m f… fine! …I’m still fine. I can do this. This is just how people worship the gods around here, after all.”\n\n\n I clamp my mouth shut, burying my face in my knees. Lutz looks at me with concern. Even if I try to tell him that I’m finding these worship poses hilarious, even if I try to explain the joke, there’s no way he’d understand. Nobody who didn’t already know about the Glico pose would understand these waves of laughter.\n\n\n This is their religion. This is their religion. They are doing this in earnest, laughing is rude.\n\n\n I remember the image of opening the classroom door and walking in on a Muslim classmate praying to Allah, and I gradually manage to soothe my cramping stomach. To an outsider, a religions prayer practices can look strange. I’m only laughing because I wasn’t expecting a Glico pose out of nowhere, that’s all. Laughing is bad.\n\n\n I take several long, slow breaths, then, when I’m confident that I can keep my face under control, raise my head. As I do that, the head priest encourages us all to stand.\n\n\n “Now, then, please rise. Let us do this together.”\n\n\n Together! Together, he says! Please, have mercy!\n\n\n Everyone around me stands up. I do so as well, but I feel the corners of my mouth squirming and my stomach twitching, the harbingers of an enormous laughing fit. No matter how much I’m telling myself over and over that laughing is bad and that laughing is bad, the urge to laugh is only growing stronger.\n\n\n “We pray to the gods!”\n\n\n The head priest intones this, raising himself into the Glico pose. This is fine. This is the second time I’m seeing this, so this isn’t shocking. I have successfully weathered this crashing wave of laughter. This is a victory for my abdominal muscles.\n\n\n In the next instant, the blue-robed priests, in perfect unison, lift their arms and legs.\n\n\n “We pray to the gods!”\n\n\n Seeing ten priests, standing in a row, with perfectly straight faces, doing the Glico pose is too much. My sides give out. The angle of their hands, the height of their legs, the seriousness of their faces are all perfectly identical. I can’t keep myself upright anymore. My legs give out and I crumple to the floor.\n\n\n “Ngh! …Mmph… nggeh…”\n\n\n My stomach! Someone, save me!\n\n\n Even though I’m still somehow able to keep my mouth shut, tears are welling up in my eyes, and snorts of laughter are still leaking out. If I could just roll around on the carpet, smacking the floor as I laugh my guts out, I know I’d get over this immediately, but being denied like this is only making my laughter stronger.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you really weren’t okay after all!”\n\n\n When I look up at Lutz, I see him looking down at me with concern as he holds the Glico pose, balancing unsteadily on one foot. He has delivered my finishing blow. I start smacking the carpet, unable to contain myself.\n\n\n “I’m sor… geheh… I can’t… breathe…”\n\n\n “Ma?ne! Why didn’t you say something earlier?!”\n\n\n “Th… that’s not it… I’m… heh… I’m fine…”\n\n\n Lutz crouches down next to me, frantically waving his hand. A gray-robed priest rushes over, looking like he’s seeing a disaster unfold.\n\n\n “You two, what’s wrong?”\n\n\n “Umm, it looks like Ma?ne isn’t feeling well, so she suddenly collapsed. She’s already pretty weak and has a fragile constitution, so since she got too excited by the ceremony…”\n\n\n Well, I certainly did get excited, but I’m not particularly feeling unwell. This is an ordinary laughing fit. There was no need to call over a priest.\n\n\n “I’m… I’m fine! I’ll be okay in a moment! Look!”\n\n\n I frantically try to stand up, but unfortunately, whether it’s because my body wasn’t expecting such a sudden movement or because I’m oxygen-deprived after laughing so much, I completely fail to put any strength in my arms and fall flat on my face in front of Lutz and the priest.\n\n\n “As if you’re fine! What about this looks like you’re fine!”\n\n\n “Urgh, that was just a mistake… I’m really okay, you know?”\n\n\n Saying that while I’m still collapsed on the floor can’t possibly be convincing at all. Even if I’m fully aware that I’m fine, if I were to step back and look at me from the outside, it is only natural that people would have a lot more faith in what Lutz is saying than what I am.\n\n\n “I’ll bring you to the aid room,” says the priest, not believing me in the slightest. “You can rest there until the ceremony is over.” He picks me up, and I don’t have the strength within me to resist.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Due to my aching sides, I retire from the baptismal ceremony. It seems like this will become the kind of bitter memory I can tell absolutely nobody else about.\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1.

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The room the gray-robed priest brings me to is not the sort of room that would be used to give aid to poor people. No, this room is for lodging. On top of that, based on how clean it is and how much care has been put into the interior design, if I were to compare it to the waiting rooms at the gate then it would definitely remind me more of the room set aside for the rich, the merchants, and those bearing letters of referral from the nobility.\n\n\n I wonder if it’s because of this dress…\n\n\n Based on how much cloth is used in a garment, and how lavishly and colorfully it’s been embroidered, it’s possible to roughly guess how much money its wearer’s household makes. Compared to my normal clothing, today’s dress is unusually fluffy and frilly. Its embroidery isn’t just limited to the hems, and tiny lace flowers have been sewn onto it. It’s extravagant. My hairpin is a custom design too, so at first glance, I think I probably look like I was rich enough to be on Freida’s level.\n\n\n But… I don’t need to expressly point out that I’m actually from a poor family, do I? The priest is the one who arbitrarily decided this, and if he were to change his mind then I have no idea what kind of treatment I’d actually get. Aren’t I always being told not to be so na?vely honest about everything?\n\n\n “Pardon me.”\n\n\n As I frown, thinking to myself, they gray-robed priest gently sits me down on a couch. I feel like I’m about to fall over, so I reach for the armrest to steady myself. At about that time, the priest gently removes my hairpin and, with careful movements, removes my shoes as well.\n\n\n Uh?!\n\n\n I’m shocked by how spontaneously and naturally this treatment is coming. This reminds me of how in Freida’s house Jutte was constantly stepping in to assist with nearly everything. This gray-robed priest is clearly accustomed to taking care of people. My eyes grow wider and I completely forget to even try to politely decline as he stands up, gets a bed ready, and carries me like a princess over to it.\n\n\n “…Ah, um, I’m really doing fine!”\n\n\n “It isn’t good to lie before the gods. You’re in a temple, you know.”\n\n\n It’s not a lie, though…\n\n\n He lays me down on the bed, then politely covers me with the blanket. Then, he places my hairpin at the bedside, and arranges my shoes at the foot of the bed. Instead of a priest, this man seems to be an incredibly skilled personal attendant. This is making me more than a little uncomfortable.\n\n\n “Rest here,” he says. “I’ll check in on you later.”\n\n\n “…Okay.”\n\n\n The priest leaves the room, closing the door behind him with a clack. It’s true that I can’t really move my body with any real power behind it, so I’ll wait here for now, recovering my strength.\n\n\n My family will undoubtedly want to know why I collapsed, but I can’t actually tell them that it’s because I was laughing too hard. Lutz, who’d been so worried, would definitely get mad if he heard that, too. As soon as I think that, the image of Lutz doing the Glico flashes through my mind, and I snort with laughter.\n\n\n I lay there idly for a while, and my strength comes back. I clench and unclench my fist to make sure of it.\n\n\n Now then, what to do? I vaguely need to go powder my nose.1\n\n\n There’s a chamber pot right next to the bed, but since I don’t know where to get water, cleaning up my mess afterwards would be problematic. The kinds of people who usually stay here probably bring servants with them so they don’t have to deal with that themselves, but I don’t have anything like that. There’s also no way I can ask that priest, who I just met, to clean up after me. At the very least, I want to find someone to ask where I can get water, then find a way to sneakily take care of my own business.\n\n\n I slowly pull myself upright, and experimentally wave my arms and legs. It looks like I’m better to the point that I’m not going to suddenly pass out again. I use my hairpin, left at my bedside, to do up my hair. At Freida’s house, there was a bell at the bedside to call for someone, but there isn’t one here.\n\n\n This is a state of emergency. Let’s go search for someone.\n\n\n I have no idea how long it will actually take to find someone, so I’d rather get started on this before things get really desperate. I climb down off of the bed, put on my shoes, and slip out of the room.\n\n\n Even though the walls are occasionally decorated with pillars, carvings, and reliefs, the corridors that stretch on ahead of me are made primarily out of white stone. The clicking of my shoes against the stone echoes off of the smooth walls, but I can’t hear anyone else’s footsteps, nor do I see any other trace of human presence. For now, I’ll start heading back towards the place where the baptismal ceremony was being held.\n\n\n …Hm? Did I take a wrong turn somewhere?\n\n\n Despite how white the temple is, I’m starting to see splashes of color here and there. The carvings and statues have gradually become more refined and elegant, to the point where I’m sure I’m not imagining how extravagant they’ve become. I think I’ve gotten myself close to where the nobility come and go.\n\n\n The blood instantly drains from my face. If a noble spots me, I’ll get interrogated, and things will get really, really difficult for me.\n\n\n Not good. I need to turn around, right now!\n\n\n I spin on my heels, then, almost trembling in fear, quickly walk back the way I came. I want to get out of the nobles’ zone as fast as I can. To make sure I don’t get lost on my way back, I try to find recognizable landmarks as I walk.\n\n\n I’ve seen that carving before, right? And I remember that cloth there, too…\n\n\n As I search for the turn that’ll take me back to the lodging room, I hear the click of another person’s footsteps drawing closer. If I had already managed to make it out of the noble’s zone, I’d be whole-heartedly thrilled about this, but right now I don’t want to be seen. I need to hide. If it’s a priest, then that’s probably fine, but I’m scared of it being a noble. I frantically look around, but there’s nowhere I can hide in this hallway. I stand out plainly, and am spotted right away.\n\n\n “Who’s there?! What are you doing here?!”\n\n\n The strict voice comes from a priestess, whose hair is done up very neatly. Her appearance is very neat and businesslike, but for some reason she also gives off the impression of being a sexy private secretary. The priestly robes she wears are the same gray color as those of the priest who had carried me in, although the design is different. Whether that’s because priests and priestesses dress differently or because there are special ceremonial robes, I don’t know. Come to think of it, there weren’t any priestesses at the ceremony, were there?\n\n\n I breathe a sigh of relief that this woman isn’t a noble, then immediately start apologizing for stepping into the nobles’ zone.\n\n\n “I’m very sorry, ma'am. My name is Ma?ne. I collapsed in the middle of the baptismal ceremony and was lent a room to rest in. I don’t have an attendant with me, and there was no bell to call for anyone, so I went to see if I could find someone. I unfortunately got lost, and when I noticed that, I’d found myself here…”\n\n\n The woman stares at me, looking me over from head to toe, then sighs resignedly. She taps her cheek, inhaling a long, weary breath, but doesn’t take her eyes off me.\n\n\n “I have business that I’m in the middle of, but afterwards I’ll show you to the hall of worship where the baptismal ceremony is being held. Do you mind waiting a little?”\n\n\n “Yes, ma'am, thank you very much.”\n\n\n The priestess, her eyes slightly narrowed, sets off, the clacking of her brisk footsteps echoing through the halls. I follow along at a half jog, trying to keep up. If we have too far to go, I’m probably going to pass out.\n\n\n “Wait here, please. I need to finish my business here.”\n\n\n However, thanks to the fact that this priestess only needed to go about another room down, I happily manage to not collapse along the way.\n\n\n “Hah, haahhh…”\n\n\n I nod, sucking in air as I try to catch my breath. The priestess looks down at me with a slightly worried frown, then pushes the door open with a creak. I put my hand on the wall to steady myself, then look through the door into which the priestess had casually passed through. When I see what’s inside, my breath stops entirely.\n\n\n “…?! Is… that… a library?”\n\n\n It’s not a particularly large room, but the walls are lined with bookshelves. With a quick glance, what I can see on them are mostly stacks of papers and wooden boards, but there are shelves hidden behind closed, locked cabinet doors, and I can easily imagine that that’s where the valuable books are kept.\n\n\n In the center of the room sit two long desks facing each other, their surfaces tilted up at a diagonal as if to make reading easier. The length reminds me of the long, connected desks in university lecture halls. They look long enough that five people could sit side by side at them.\n\n\n Also, attached to the desks at rough intervals are six thick, sturdy chains. The ends of each of these is fastened to six massive books, which are lined up on the desks.\n\n\n “…It’s a ‘chained library’…”\n\n\n Visiting historical libraries in foreign countries had been one of my dreams when I was Urano. Sure, this is an alternate universe and not a foreign country, and this is a temple’s library, but even still, can I count this as a dream come true? A foreign library, locked bookshelves, books chained to tables, books that you could feel the history of the library through, no matter which you read… this is something that I could have never practically managed to see back then.\n\n\n The hand I put on my chest to calm myself down quivers. My heart is pounding like an alarm, and I can feel how powerfully the blood is rushing through my veins. The things I’ve wanted for so very, very long are miraculously right before my eyes… eyes from which hot tears of joy are falling, one after another.\n\n\n “I’ve… I’ve never seen this before…”\n\n\n This is my first chained library, but, more importantly, this is the first time since I came to this world that I’ve seen enough books in one place for a room to be properly called a library at all. It’s not all that large of a room, but to me, having lived my life without having ever found a single book, this is a veritable treasury of happiness.\n\n\n Perhaps this library is a paradise made by the gods themselves. My god is here for me!\n\n\n “We pray to the gods! We give thanks to the gods!”\n\n\n When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Deeply moved by finding this library, no, this chained library, I make the Glico pose, then drop into a dogeza, lifting my thanks to the heavens. I’m a little wobbly when I do it, but I hope that both my emotions and my gratitude were properly conveyed.\n\n\n I quickly scrub my face and hands on my clothing, checking over and over to make sure they’re not the slightest bit dirty. After verifying that my hands are spotless, I turn to follow the priestess, and with a triumphant stride, step forth into this glorious paradise.\n\n\n “Pardon my intrusMPH?!”\n\n\n My face smacks into something, like I’d just walked into a sliding door that hadn’t yet opened. Since I’d slammed into it so forcefully, stars dance before my eyes.\n\n\n “Owww…”\n\n\n I sit there on the ground, rubbing my head with one hand. With my other hand, I reach out towards the door. After a certain point, I can’t move my hand any further. It seems that there really is some kind of invisible wall there. I try hitting it a couple of times, but there’s no sign of it opening.\n\n\n “Huh? Wh… why?”\n\n\n The priestess had walked in normally with no issue. I have no idea why only I would be rejected like this. The world before my eyes grows a little darker, and I start pounding on the invisible wall. It doesn’t budge an inch.\n\n\n Paradise is before my very eyes, yet I cannot enter. I can see so many books right in front of me, yet I cannot touch them. Is it okay for such a cruel torture to exist? To come so far and then be denied? You asshole gods! Give me back my gratitude!\n\n\n “Nooo, let me in!! Let me in tooo!”\n\n\n Books are so valuable that, practically, only the nobility have access to them. The temple used a magical tool to quiet children down during the baptismal ceremony, so it’s not unreasonable to think there’s some gimmick protecting these precious books. I know that, but this is just too much. Caught in the grip of this despair at being able to see, but not enter this room, I collapse in an undignified heap, unable to even wipe away the tears spilling from my face.\n\n\n “I just want to read…”\n\n\n The priestess, finished with her business, exits the room carrying a bundle of papers that look like some sort of documents. She looks down on me as I sit on the floor, leaning against the invisible wall, and crying my eyes out, and takes a startled step back.\n\n\n “What are… you doing…?”\n\n\n “Waaaaaah!! Why, why can’t I go in?”\n\n\n I smash my fists weakly into the invisible wall, the priestess looks back behind her, into the library room. “Ah,” she says.\n\n\n “There’s very valuable books in there, so only people authorized by the temple are able to enter.”\n\n\n Her words give me a sudden flash of hope. If only people authorized by the temple are able to enter, then I should get that authorization. The gods have not abandoned me yet. I quickly rub the tears and snot from my face, then shoot my hand straight up into the air.\n\n\n “Question! How might I become authorized by the temple?”\n\n\n “…The simplest way would be to become a sister-in-training, wouldn’t it?”\n\n\n It seems that apprentice priestesses are called sisters-in-training. In that case, since this woman is grown, she’d be referred to as a sister.\n\n\n “Then, I’ll become a sister-in-training! How do I do that?”\n\n\n “You’d need to talk to the head priest or the temple master. Now then, let’s go to the hall of worship.”\n\n\n She looks like she thinks the conversation’s finished, but I shake my head vigorously.\n\n\n “Where might the temple master be?”\n\n\n “His part in the baptismal ceremony is over by now, so he’ll most likely be in his chambers, but… you want to go now?”\n\n\n She’s quite clearly trying to push me away, but I’m not going to let this source of valuable information out of my grasp.\n\n\n “Yes, ma'am! I can’t go home until I do!”\n\n\n “…Let’s go ask the temple master, then.”\n\n\n I don’t know if it’s because she understands my deep conviction or if it’s because she’s judging how to treat me based on my clothing, but she sighs resignedly, then brings me to the temple master’s chambers.\n\n\n It seems like I managed to get entirely lost inside the temple, because the temple master’s chambers are very close by. I’m left outside a magnificent wooden door as the priestess gets permission to enter. Looking around, I see all sorts of expensive-looking ornaments and paintings. The higher-ups of this religion must be very rich.\n\n\n “Father B?sewanz3, there’s an applicant to become a sister-in-waiting here to see you…”\n\n\n “An applicant?”\n\n\n Through the crack left in the door, I hear the temple master and the priestess conversing. Tension wells up in me at the realization that this is about to be a job interview. Making sure I’m hidden behind the door, I quickly check to make sure my appearance is in order. The one spot on my dress that had gotten wet from tears and snot has dried, although it’s a bit stiff.\n\n\n “Yes, a girl who came here for today’s baptismal ceremony.”\n\n\n “Hmm, perhaps I should meet her.”\n\n\n “Please go in,” says the priestess to me.\n\n\n I try to enter the room quickly and professionally, but the door is far heavier than I thought it was going to be. With no other choice, I throw my weight behind it, pushing the door open with all my strength, and then slip through the gap as soon as it’s big enough.\n\n\n “Pardon my intrusion,” I say.\n\n\n The temple master’s chambers very much resemble Freida’s room. In the center of the room, close to the door, there is something of a reception area, with a table and a few chairs in the center. On the very far wall of the room is a bed with a thick canopy, and in the opposite corner there’s a place for doing work. The workspace has a thick desk and two bookshelves. On a display shelf sit thirty-centimeter-tall statues of the gods, the scriptures I saw a little while ago during the ceremony, and candles, arranged symmetrically so that the scriptures are in the center.\n\n\n The temple master and the priestess are at that work space, so I approach them, minding my posture. He’s fixing me with an almost painfully hard stare as I approach. I take a slow breath and ready all of my determination. This is a job interview. The job interview that will decide whether or not I can ever enter that library.\n\n\n “Your name?”\n\n\n “Ma?ne, sir,” I say. I clasp my hands in front of my chest. “If at all possible, I would like to become a sister-in-training here. I would very much appreciate your consideration.”\n\n\n The temple master gives me a slightly amused smile, then puts down his pen. “Well then, Ma?ne. Why don’t I start by asking you why you think you’d want to become a sister-in-training?”\n\n\n “Because there’s a library here, sir.”\n\n\n The temple master’s eyes widen slightly, perhaps because my answer was so completely unexpected.\n\n\n “…The library? You can read?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir, although there’s a lot of difficult words I still don’t know. If I can read a book, I’ll learn more words. That’s why, for as long as I live, I’d like to thoroughly read all of the books here.”\n\n\n The temple master rubs at his forehead, sighing. His shoulders drop so much that it looks almost forced, and he shakes his head.\n\n\n “I think you might be misunderstanding something. A temple is where one prays to the gods. The priests and priestesses here are servants of the gods.”\n\n\n “Of course,” I reply. “I’m well aware of that. But, wasn’t that thick book of scriptures you read to us at today’s ceremony written about the gods? To me, those scriptures are as the gods themselves. I wish to read everything about the gods. I would like to learn everything about the gods, sir.”\n\n\n “Are you a scriptural fundamentalist?”\n\n\n A sharp gleam enters the temple master’s eyes. I have no idea whether or not I should say yes or no to that question. It’s a little troubling, but I can’t imagine that that’s a phrase any of the other kids I attended the baptismal ceremony with would have known. Rather than risk saying anything unnecessary, I think it would be best if I just tell him that I don’t know.\n\n\n “I’ve never heard those words before, so I don’t know what they mean, but there isn’t a shred of doubt in my heart: I want to read the scriptures and learn about the gods. Please, believe in the passion that the god of fire has blessed me with. I truly hope and pray that I can become a sister-in-training, read all of the books here, and learn about the gods. How can I convince you of this?”\n\n\n He looks a little taken aback when I press him for an answer, but he looks me up and down, hums contemplatively to himself, and then nods.\n\n\n “I’m already convinced of your passion. If that is indeed your wish, then you certainly should become a sister-in-training.”\n\n\n “Really?!”\n\n\n “However, if a child of a family such as yours wishes to join the church, they must make a donation that matches that level of passion. Do you know how much that is?”\n\n\n It appears that, since my clothing implies I have a lot of money, this man is going to try to take advantage of me. “If you want to join, pay up,” he seems to be saying. I’m already fully aware that a religion such as this can’t be exclusively made of nice ideals. All he’s asking is that, if I want to join, how much money can I comfortably offer him in exchange?\n\n\n Now that I think of it, I’ve heard that to buy a single book, you need to spend several small gold coins. If I were to gain access to that chained library, then I’d have access to at least ten of those bulky books. I don’t have any basis for this besides rental libraries in Japan, but in those libraries, you pay about as much as a book in order to be able to read all of the books in the library. Then, if you add to that all of the documents on the shelves as well as the ability to read as much as I want before I die, and then set aside the money I’ve been saving for my family… one large gold coin shouldn’t be a problem.\n\n\n “I don’t know what the actual price of a donation is, but… if I think about the amount of money I have available to me, I could spend up to one large gold coin.”\n\n\n “L… large?!”, the temple master shouts, spittle flying from his mouth.\n\n\n The priestess, as well, claps her hand over her mouth, her eyes wide. Judging by their reactions, I’m fairly confident that I presented them with an excessively huge sum of money.\n\n\n “Huh? Is that too much? But, that’s just the absolute maximum, so I can pay less, you know?”\n\n\n The temple master exchanges a look with the priestess, then clears his throat, as if to smooth over that outburst. He leans forward, looking at me seriously.\n\n\n “Ahh… well, although I am overjoyed that a girl such as yourself burns with enough passion that she’d be willing to go that far to join our temple as a sister-in-training, by the time the baptismal ceremony comes around, you have already decided where you’d like to work, correct? Aren’t you already a member of something else?”\n\n\n Of course, if I were to already have a place of employment picked out, suddenly becoming a sister-in-training wouldn’t be feasible. However, I’d been planning on working out of my home, so I don’t actually have a workplace to leave.\n\n\n “I’m already provisionally registered with the merchants’ guild, but I don’t yet have a job. My body is very frail, so I was planning on working from home.”\n\n\n “Working from home? A daughter of merchants? If you were to become a sister-in-training, you’d have to sever any links you have with other organizations. What would your parents say if you were to withdraw from the merchants’ guild and become a sister-in-training?”\n\n\n “I’ll have to talk this over with my parents, but…”\n\n\n I trail off. I can’t immediately answer about the merchants’ guild. I’m probably going to need to still be in it if I’m going to continue buying and selling things.\n\n\n “I wonder if I can even withdraw from the merchants’ guild at all? What would happen to all of the money I’ve made so far, and all of the products I’m going to be developing in the future?”\n\n\n As I wonder aloud, trying to gather my thoughts, the temple master, overhearing, widens his eyes a bit, looking like he has a question to ask.\n\n\n “The money you’ve made? The products? Are you not just helping out with your parents’ work?”\n\n\n “No, sir.”\n\n\n This is my chance to show how uniquely appealing it would be for me to join the temple. Recalling the list of important things to cover in a job interview, I explain to him all of the things I’ve tried so hard to do, and all of the ways I’ve learned from my experiences. In brief.\n\n\n “…Hm,” he says, “if you’re not registered with the guild so that you could help with your parents’ business, then perhaps instead of having you withdraw your registration, you could simply join us here. I might need to consult with the guild master, though.”\n\n\n He smiles at me admiringly, as if that’s exactly the answer he needed to hear. If he could talk with the higher-ups in the merchants’ guild for me, that would be a huge lifesaver. I thank him politely, entrusting the negotiations with the guild master to him.\n\n\n “First, I do need to consult my parents,” I say.\n\n\n “Well, if your parents object or if there are any other issues, then please come talk with me right away. If what you’re after is reading books, then please, come here, to this room. You wouldn’t be able to enter the library, but I would be happy to let you read the scriptures I have here.”\n\n\n “Really?! Thank you so much! Prayers to the gods!”\n\n\n The instant I leap up into the Glico pose, I can feel my body start to lazily tilt to the side, and all the blood starts to drain from my face.\n\n\n I overdid it again, didn’t I.\n\n\n Since Lutz isn’t here, there’s nobody to stop me from getting overexcited or running around recklessly. It seems like I, having paid no attention at all to my own behavior, have pushed my body past its maximum limit, and it’s rebelling my cutting me off from all of my strength.\n\n\n “…Oh, not again…”\n\n\n With a thump, I fall to the ground and can’t get up. I’m very thankful that this time I’m still conscious, even if I can’t move my body. As I lay there, I focus all of my mental energy at the blob of devouring fever within me, even though there’s not all that much of it at the moment.\n\n\n “What’s wrong?! What happened?!”\n\n\n The temple master’s eyes are wide with alarm as he watches me collapse and go still before his very eyes. He stands up with enough force to knock his chair back. The priestess, dumbfounded, stares at me, and then murmurs to herself in a quiet voice.\n\n\n “…Now that I think of it,” she says, tilting her head to the side, “didn’t she say she’d collapsed in the middle of the baptismal ceremony?”\n\n\n “What?” says the temple chief, looking up at her.\n\n\n Stuck here on the ground, I apologize to the two of them.\n\n\n “I’m sorry, but I got a little overexcited. I can’t move at all right now, but please, just give me a minute.”\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. The Japanese term originally used here is お花を摘みに行く, or “go pick some flowers”. This is a feminine euphemism for using the restroom.\n\n\n 2. There’s a bit of a distinction here that was lost in translation. The word 神官 (“shinkan”) generally means “priest”, but is generally gendered male. Until this point, Ma?ne has been referring to this priestess as a “female priest”, but in this conversation the actual in-setting word used was revealed to be 巫女 (“miko”), which is most commonly translated as “shrine maiden”, but can be used to represent priestesses as well.\n\n\n 3. The temple master is not explicitly named here in the original text, as it’s common in Japanese to refer to your superiors purely by their title. This sounds extremely stiff in English, so here the priestess refers to him by his name and informal title. Ma?ne, a proper Japanese woman, will continue internally referring to people by their titles as long as the author deems necessary."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The temple master, having seen me collapse right in front of him, summons a gray-robed priest to carry me to the lodging room, and left a priestess to keep an eye on me so that I don’t go wandering off again.\n\n\n As a result, I wasn’t able to sneak out to go use the restroom by myself, but had to rely on the priestess’s help. Having to do my business while someone else watches is mortifying, and after being forced to ask the priestess for help cleaning up my waste I am so unbelievably embarrassed that I can’t even look her in the eye any more. I want to pull the covers all the way over my head and writhe in utter shame, but I can’t actually muster any strength to make my body do so.\n\n\n While I lie limply on the bed, dejected about the things I can’t do, the baptismal ceremony comes to an end, and Lutz comes in to check on me. When he sees how nice the room is, and notices that someone is here to keep an eye on me, his eyes go wide and he rushes up to my bedside.\n\n\n “What did you do this time, Ma?ne?!”\n\n\n “Ummm, I got lost looking for the restroom… and collapsed.”\n\n\n When I weakly lift my head from the pillow and give him very broad summary, he stares at me, unimpressed, then folds his arms and shakes his head.\n\n\n “That can’t be all, right? Tell me everything.”\n\n\n “Guh… Um, well, I found a library, and I got a little excited…”\n\n\n Halfway through my sentence, Lutz squints, tilting his head.\n\n\n “What’s a ‘library’?”\n\n\n “An earthly paradise, crafted by the gods.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n “…A room with lots of books.”\n\n\n “Ahh… Well, whatever. I get the gist of it either way.”\n\n\n He rubs his forehead, waving dismissively. Since he cut off my story, I start getting ready to go home, reaching for the hairpin placed at my bedside.\n\n\n “You’re leaving out something important, aren’t you? This little princess collapsed after she went to appeal to the temple master.”\n\n\n As I wind my hair up, the priestess, who had been quietly listening to our conversation, interrupts, shocked, then shrugs.\n\n\n “What were you thinking, you idiot?!” says Lutz.\n\n\n “Sorry. I’m really thinking that I got a little too excited, though…”\n\n\n Things would probably have gone better if I’d been a little more cool and collected, but it still turned out more-or-less all right. I accomplished my goal of laying the groundwork for becoming a priestess here, and the temple master will even let me go to his room to read the scriptures. I’m trying to properly reflect on my actions, but I don’t really have any regrets.\n\n\n “We’re going home before you do anything else,” he says.\n\n\n Lutz carries me on his back and, with the priestess’s guidance, leads us out of the temple. My father is nervously waiting for us in the plaza outside.\n\n\n “…Looks like someone’s here for you,” says the priestess. “Well, this is as far as I go.”\n\n\n “Thank you for all of the help,” I say.\n\n\n And so, my father carries me on his back and takes me home. Along the way, Lutz gives my father a brief rundown of the day’s events. I leave it to him, as the swaying up here is lulling me to sleep.\n\n\n “I’ve got to finish up my contract here at the shop,” says Lutz, “so I’ll head home after that.”\n\n\n I snap back to my senses when I hear that, and see that we’re outside Benno’s shop. It’s clear that in my current condition I’m in no shape to visit Benno’s myself. Lutz is splitting off from us here, since he needs to deliver today’s report and to handle his apprenticeship contract.\n\n\n Mark sees us from inside the shop and comes out to greet us. I wave at him from my spot on my father’s back.\n\n\n “Thanks for earlier, Mister Mark,” I say. “I don’t think I can visit today, but I’ll come back later.”\n\n\n “Take care of yourself,” he replies.\n\n\n “Lutz, good luck with the contract,” I say.\n\n\n “Yeah! Go get some rest.”\n\n\n Lutz and Mark see us off with a wave, and my father and I head home together.\n\n\n After a slightly extravagant celebratory dinner, as the family sits around drinking tea, I look at my father. I don’t have much choice, I need to ask him about becoming a priestess.\n\n\n “Hey, Daddy.”\n\n\n “What’s up?”\n\n\n He lifts his cup to his mouth and takes a sip.\n\n\n “I want to go to the temple and become a sister-in-training, I think.”\n\n\n My father’s smile vanishes in an instant.\n\n\n In the next moment, he slams his cup down onto the table with an enormous bang. I flinch in sudden shock as the tea flies out of the cup, splashing all over the table.\n\n\n “…Could you repeat that?” he says, in a low, threatening tone. “I must not have heard you correctly.”\n\n\n My eyes widen. The anger and disgust rolling off of him is so powerful that it sends shivers down my spine and makes my heart pound.\n\n\n “…A priestess, at the temple.”\n\n\n “Don’t be ridiculous! As if I’d ever let my daughter join the temple.”\n\n\n “D… Daddy. Why are you so angry?”\n\n\n I have no idea what on earth could have made him so suddenly angry, so all I can do is stare in bewilderment. I’d thought that there would be some opposition, but I hadn’t even considered that the topic would cause my father to have this kind of furious outburst.\n\n\n “Apprenticing as a priest or priestess is something that orphans do! If you don’t have parents and don’t have a patron, then that’s your last resort in order to survive. That’s not for you, Ma?ne!”\n\n\n “Only orphans… become priests?”\n\n\n “Yeah, that’s right,” says my father, suddenly looking helpless. “You’ve got parents, so it’s not a job for you. Don’t ask me again!”\n\n\n I’m dumbfounded by my father’s reaction. Then, something clicks, and I realize what he’s saying. I think I might have been misled a bit by how the temple master had said that he hadn’t expected there to be any applicants to become apprentice priestesses from someone “with a family like yours”.\n\n\n “Gunther,” says my mother, “Ma?ne didn’t know, there’s no need to get so upset with her.”\n\n\n “…Yeah, you’re right.”\n\n\n My father takes a long slow breath, as if to let out his irritation, then rustles my hair. My mother starts wiping up the splash of tea from the table, tilting her head curiously.\n\n\n “But, either way, why in the world did you suddenly decide that you wanted to be a priestess?”\n\n\n I can see from how my parents are talking that we have a different view on how we think about priests and priestesses. If I had to describe how I thought about priests and priestesses, I’d say that I thought they’d generally be pretty respectable, so this is a little surprising.\n\n\n “So, um, after I collapsed at the baptismal ceremony, I went to look for the restroom and got really lost.”\n\n\n “You were in the aid room, right? Isn’t there one right when you exit?”\n\n\n My father, who’d gotten a simplified rundown of events from Lutz, cocks his head in puzzlement. Certainly, there do tend to be restrooms very near large rooms that commoners use.\n\n\n I shake my head. “…Since my dress was so nice, they mistook me for some kind of rich girl, so I got brought to a different room, like the one where merchants with letters of recommendation from nobles go. So, there wasn’t one nearby…”\n\n\n “Aah, of course, if it was that dress.”\n\n\n My father nods several times. My mother and Tuuli look pretty understanding as well.\n\n\n “While I was looking, I kinda stumbled into a place that looked like it was used by the nobility…”\n\n\n All the blood drains from my parents’ faces. In a society that’s as stratified as this one, we’re actually completely segregated from the nobility. If I were to stagger around, lost, and get caught by a noble, there’s a good chance that might be the end of my life right there.\n\n\n “I was found by a priestess, so I didn’t meet a noble, but there was a library! There were so many books there. I really, really wanted to read them, so bad I couldn’t help it, but I couldn’t go in…”\n\n\n “Books?” says my father, his eyebrow twitching.\n\n\n “When I asked if there was any way I could go in, she said that I could if I became a sister-in-training…”\n\n\n “And then you just decided you’d become a priestess without thinking about it?” He sighs. “Give up on those books. Just keep making them like you’ve been doing so far.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n I stare blankly at him, unable to believe that I was just told to give up on books. He stares back at me, completely serious, without a single trace of a smile on his face.\n\n\n “If you had to choose between cutting all ties with your family and going to live in an orphanage so you could be a priestess and read books, or staying here with us like you’ve always done, what would you pick?”\n\n\n He asks me to choose between books and my family, and my head goes blank. I want to stay with my family until the very end, before the devouring rots me away. I’ve been thinking that while I do that I’d make a few books and read those until I was satisfied. Today, however, I found a library, and was overjoyed that I might be able to read books, and got very excited, but I hadn’t even considered that I might get separated from my family.\n\n\n “…Cutting ties… with my family?”\n\n\n My shoulders shake, and my voice comes out weak and cracked. My father nods gravely.\n\n\n “That’s right. Apprentice priestesses live in the temple. The work is hard, and the people you’d be working together with are all orphans. It’s not the kind of thing you could do since you have the devouring. You collapsed during the ceremony because you couldn’t manage your physical condition, so how do you expect to be able to work? Plus, books are extremely valuable. They’re rare enough that those people are protecting them using some sort of magical tool to make sure strangers can’t go into their library, right? Do you think that you’d be able to touch them as soon as you become an apprentice?”\n\n\n Every single point he makes is a good one. I’ve got no room to refute any of it. The answer in my head is clear: becoming a priestess won’t work. However, I really don’t want to give up on all of those books that I’ve found. As I chew on my lip, feeling like I’m about to cry, Tuuli takes my hand. Her eyes are brimming with tears, and she squeezes my hand like she never wants to let go.\n\n\n “You want to be a priestess? You promised me that you’d stay here with me, but you want to break your promise and go be a priestess?”\n\n\n Tuuli’s words hit me like an arrow through my heart. Feeling like all the strength has left my body, I shake my head.\n\n\n “…Nuh-uh. I was just trying to think of a way that I could read the books that were right in front of me. I didn’t really want to be a priestess at all.”\n\n\n Apprenticing as a priestess is a means to an end, not the end itself. I don’t want to become one so badly that I’d make my entire family cry and leave them forever.\n\n\n When I answer, Tuuli smiles brilliantly, but a sliver of anxiety still remains.\n\n\n “I’m glad,” she says. “…You’ll stay here with me, right? Like we promised?”\n\n\n “Yeah. …When I’m feeling better, I’ll go see the temple master and tell him no.”\n\n\n When he hears my answer, my father suddenly breathes a huge sigh of relief, like he’d been holding his breath the entire time, and hugs me tightly.\n\n\n “I’m so glad you understand. You’re my precious daughter. Don’t go off to the temple.”\n\n\n While in my heart I really am happy that this ended without me making my family cry, the instant I close off my path towards that library, the devouring fever, of course, starts to spread through my body.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, your temperature’s going up, isn’t it?” says my father.\n\n\n “Didn’t you collapse several times today?” says my mother. “The stress of talking about this must have been the only thing keeping you going. Go rest already.”\n\n\n I’m put to bed, and as I feel the devouring fever slowly spread through me, I gently close my eyes.\n\n\n I didn’t think I’d ever not be able to chose books.\n\n\n Until now, there hadn’t even been a “not books” option in me. Back in my Urano days, I probably would have immediately picked the books and leave my family behind. No matter what, books were foremost in my mind. Despite that, I’m not immediately choosing books. I’d been thinking that my family was the most important thing to me only in the absence of readily-available books, but at some point it looks like they’ve become just as important to me as books are.\n\n\n But still, I finally found books, though. I really want to read them…\n\n\n I’m not able to choose between my family and books, but there’s no way I can just abandon books entirely. In this kind of mental state, even though I’m trying to contain my fever like I usually do, I can’t really manage it as well as I usually do. It struggles with more force, as if sneering at me for being unable to cast off my lingering desires for that library. Irritated at how I can’t make this fever move, I start trying to come up with a way that I can find some compromise between books and my family.\n\n\n Is there any way I can read those books without becoming a sister-in-training? Since the temple master’s attitude changed after we started talking about donations, perhaps I could try saving a bit more, then throw money at them until they let me in? I’m not really the kind of person who likes slapping people around with money to get my way, but desperate times call for desperate measures, do they not? For now, if I could only go to the temple master’s room and read the scriptures, that would be satisfying enough, wouldn’t it?\n\n\n It ultimately takes me about two days to shut away the devouring fever. When my temperature finally goes back down and I can finally get up, my body is still sluggish. The devouring fever’s receded, so if I spend another day resting I should be recovered after that, I think.\n\n\n Lutz comes to check on me, and when he sees my face gives me a difficult expression.\n\n\n “You’re still not looking too good. Master Benno said that he wanted to talk with you, but it looks like you can’t do that today.”\n\n\n “Lutz, do you have plans tomorrow? I want to go to the temple, and then after that go to Mister Benno’s shop; can you come with me?”\n\n\n When I ask my question, Lutz tilts his head slightly to the side.\n\n\n “The temple? Sure, but what do you need there?”\n\n\n “To read the scriptures. …Also, to tell them that I don’t want to be a sister-in-training.”\n\n\n “Huh?! An apprentice priestess? Where’d that come from?”\n\n\n Come to think of it, although the priestess had said that I’d collapsed while making an appeal to the temple priestess, she hadn’t said just what I was appealing to him for.\n\n\n “I told you that I found a library during the baptismal ceremony, right? I was told that the only people who could go in were people connected to the temple, so I thought that I should get connected to the temple. I heard that being a sister-in-training was the simplest way to do that so I jumped straight to that.”\n\n\n “Isn’t that more reckless than me wanting to be a trader? Look at reality for once. Aren’t you the one who taught me not to leap straight ahead, but to look for a different path that’s actually possible?”\n\n\n Hearing those words coming from Lutz, who’d gone from a boy just dreaming about a better life to a boy with his feet firmly on the ground as he chases after that dream, is pretty painful.\n\n\n “…I wasn’t thinking about anything but the shortest route to reading those books.”\n\n\n “Man, you don’t pay attention to anything else when books are involved. It’s okay to just not go back to the temple at all, right? Jumping between hope and despair isn’t good for your body. Doesn’t that make your devouring fever start going crazy?”\n\n\n “I was only able to get it under control this time by telling myself that I could at least go and read the scriptures,” I say.\n\n\n He looks down at me, at a loss for words, then smiles wryly, patting me on the head.\n\n\n “A compromise with yourself, huh? I didn’t think you’d ever back down when it came to books. Good job, that must have been hard. …Well, if just going to the temple will make you feel better, then sure. I really think living there would be way too much for you.”\n\n\n “Yeah, I know.”\n\n\n The next day, I head with Lutz over to the temple. I put on my new, nicer clothing, since we’ll be going to Benno’s shop afterwards. Also, since the area around temple master’s chambers is particularly nice, I don’t think it would be proper for me to show up in my usual attire.\n\n\n I tell the temple gatekeeper my name, and that I’d like to meet with the temple master. It seems like they had already been told about me, because a gray-robed priest appears, ready to show me around the temple.\n\n\n “What will you do, Lutz? Even if you came with me, you wouldn’t have anything to do, right? Maybe you could go to Mister Benno’s shop and study? When I’m done with my business here, I can go to the shop too.”\n\n\n “I’ll come pick you up at fifth bell, so wait here. Don’t go wandering off by yourself, okay?”\n\n\n “Okay,” I reply.\n\n\n The gray-robed priest guides me through the temple to the temple master’s chambers, but the temple master isn’t there. Instead, the head priest, dressed in blue robes, is there to greet me. He’s roughly the same age as my father, with pale blue hair that reaches down towards his shoulders. The temple master had been a dignified, slightly portly older man, but the head priest is fairly tall and slender. He looks like he’s used to practical work involving organizing people and running about.\n\n\n “You must be Ma?ne?” he says. “My name is Ferdinand1. Father B?sewanz told me about you. Please, come in.”\n\n\n “Thank you very much,” I say.\n\n\n “He’s asked me to read the scriptures to you until he comes back.”\n\n\n It seems like the high priest is here to read aloud to me, but why would the high priest himself be here to entertain me? What did I do this time? …Ah, the donation, huh?\n\n\n Since I’m someone who can give them a lot of money, they’re treating me with a lot of courtesy, I think. It seems like the amount of money I presented them with had a pretty significant impact. If that’s the case, depending on how negotiations go, I might be able to open the way towards that library.\n\n\n “Now then, please have a seat over there and listen.”\n\n\n We sit down at the table in the center of the room and he starts reading to me, but because I’m sitting across from him, all I can see is the book’s cover. It seems like they won’t let me touch the book. They’re treating me with caution, not knowing what I might do or what I might be thinking.\n\n\n “Um, Father. I don’t want to just listen, I want to actually see the book.”\n\n\n “Why is that? Didn’t you want to know the story of the gods?”\n\n\n “I do, but I also want to learn new vocabulary words as well.”\n\n\n From his face, it looks like my words struck a weak point. He thinks for a minute, then nods deeply.\n\n\n “…Ah, I see. However, these are our very precious scriptures. Can you promise me that you absolutely won’t touch them?”\n\n\n “I promise.”\n\n\n The high priest lifts me up on his lap so that I can see the scriptures, then starts reading aloud. The pages of the book are yellowed around the edges from where they’ve been touched, and are covered with absolutely beautifully-inked calligraphy. I inhale a deep lungful of the scent of old paper, then let out a slow, appreciative sigh.\n\n\n It seems that the story we had been told during the baptismal ceremony really had been significantly rephrased in much simpler vocabulary. It has a very different sound to it now. As the high priest reads to me, I start learning new vocabulary words. It’s fascinating to see all sorts of common nouns and verbs that I’ve been wondering how to spell for so long show up one right after another. I point out words that I recognize in the scriptures, careful not to touch the pages, and the high priest, looking amused, starts helping me with the rest.\n\n\n “You’re a very quick learner! If you’re this good at absorbing knowledge, teaching you is very worthwhile. …You aren’t nobility, are you? Perhaps one of your parents might have some noble blood in them?”\n\n\n “Not in the slightest, I don’t think.”\n\n\n “Ah, a shame.”\n\n\n I have no idea why the high priest would think that’s a shame. However, I get the feeling that the high priest might be like Mark, in charge of the education of the priests and priestesses. He seems very teacher-like, perhaps, and gives an impression that he’s very accustomed to teaching things to other people, much like Mark.\n\n\n “Ahh, you’ve come?” says the temple master as he enters the room. “I hope I haven’t kept you waiting.”\n\n\n Now that the temple master has returned, the high priest tells me to return to my seat, and he carefully sets the book back on its shelf.\n\n\n “Since Father Ferdinand was reading the scriptures to me,” I reply, “it was a very fun and worthwhile use of my time. Thank you very much for your consideration.”\n\n\n With slow, easy movements, the temple master moves to sit down in the chair the high priest had been sitting in, while the high priest stands to one side.\n\n\n “Well then, what did your parents say?”\n\n\n “They told me that only orphans become priestesses, so they scolded me and told me no.”\n\n\n The high priest had been leaning towards me with anticipation gleaming in his eyes, but when I tell him this his shoulders droop dejectedly. He sighs, shaking his head. Next to him, the high priest opens his mouth to speak.\n\n\n “It’s not entirely true that only orphans join the clergy. Noble children do so as well. It’s true that an orphan is very likely to become a priest or a priestess, but that’s because they can’t find another profession. The jobs that orphans can take are sharply limited, so they often have no choice but to become priests and priestesses.”\n\n\n I blink a few times. “Why can’t they find another profession?”\n\n\n “They don’t have anyone to refer them to one, and they don’t have anyone to look after them.”\n\n\n I can clearly understand this. The system of employment in this town is highly dependent on having a relative or a friend who can refer you to an apprenticeship, so it would of course be extremely difficult for an orphan. It’s already hard for people to find jobs besides the ones their parents can refer them to, so I can’t even imagine how hard it must be for an orphan, who can’t even find any connections.\n\n\n “So, I’d like to be clear, it is possible for you to become a priestess without being an orphan.”\n\n\n “I understand. However, my parents also told me that if I was an apprentice here I’d have to live in the temple, and the difficult work I’d have to do here would be far too stressful for my weak body.”\n\n\n “Do you mean that you weren’t simply feeling weak, but you are normally frail?”\n\n\n The temple master frowns slightly, stroking his white mustache, and I realize that his face would make him look perfect in a Santa suit in the snow. I give him a big nod.\n\n\n “That’s right. I have a disease called 'the devouring’.”\n\n\n “The devouring?!”\n\n\n The slow, graceful temple master suddenly stands bolt upright, his eyes wide. The high priest, already standing, slams his hand into the table, leaning towards me excitedly.\n\n\n “Did you say devouring?!”\n\n\n “Y… yes. Is something wrong?”\n\n\n The two of them have completely different expressions as they crowd their faces towards me, and I instinctively shrink back. I frown, wondering if I’ve somehow said something terrible, and the temple master slowly lifts a trembling finger towards the door.\n\n\n “Father Ferdinand,” he says, “please bring the relic.”\n\n\n “I know!”\n\n\n The high priest nods slightly, then makes use of his long legs to briskly stride out of the room. He appeared so elegant at first glance, but he is amazingly quick. He seems in such a hurry that he leaves the door open behind him after he leaves. I stare at him, dumbfounded, as he leaves, but out of the corner of my eye, I see the temple master turn to the shelf the book of scriptures is resting on.\n\n\n “We pray to the gods!”\n\n\n He suddenly starts praying, rising into the Glico pose. Caught in his rhythm, I reflexively raise my hands as well.\n\n\n “We give thanks to the gods!”\n\n\n Flowing like water, he sinks down into a dogeza, and I stare, dumbfounded, at his back. I tremble in fear, wondering what the hell is going on. I’m convinced that something terrible is clearly happening. I really want to run far away from here, but judging from their threatening attitude a moment ago I can’t imagine they’d let me escape so easily.\n\n\n Frozen stiff in my chair, I slowly look away from the temple master, who continues to pray. From outside the door, I hear very rapid footsteps quickly growing louder, and the high priest bursts back into the room, carrying something wrapped in a bundle of cloth. He unwraps the cloth, revealing the chalice I’d seen during the baptismal ceremony, and gently sets it down on the table.\n\n\n “Please, touch this chalice.”\n\n\n “Huh? It’s really okay for me to touch this?”\n\n\n “Yes, quickly now!”\n\n\n I timidly reach out for the chalice on the table. The two of them watch it closely, their eyes sparkling. The moment my fingertip reaches the chalice, it starts gleaming with dazzling light.\n\n\n “Whoa?! What the heck?!”\n\n\n I frantically yank my hand back, and the light gradually fades. As I look back and forth between my finger and the chalice, the temple master and head priest look at each other, then exchange nods.\n\n\n “Ma?ne,” says the temple master, “I’d like to speak with your parents.”\n\n\n Mother, Father, I’m sorry.\n\n\n It seems something important just happened.\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. As with the temple master, I’m introducing this character’s name earlier than in the original text to make dialogue less stiff."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The temple master and the head priest look at me with gleaming eyes, and I falter. The head priest, perhaps noticing that my face has frozen up, goes to get the scriptures. While I wait for Lutz to come and pick me up, the head priest reads to me like before, letting me sit on his lap and teaching me various things. I’m happy about this, but there’s a weird sort of tension in the air, and I very much would like to run as far away as possible.\n\n\n Shortly after the fifth bell rings, a gray-robed priest enters the room. “A boy named Lutz is here for Ma?ne,” he says. I breathe a sign of relief, having grown increasingly impatient as I waited for him.\n\n\n “Lutz is here? I have to go, then. Father B?sewanz, Father Ferdinand, thank you for letting me come here today.”\n\n\n “Alright. Ma?ne, please, I’d like you to give this to your parents.”\n\n\n The temple master holds a written invitation. A written invitation from the temple master himself is nothing short of a summons that cannot be refuse. The day and time of the appointment is the day after tomorrow, at the third bell. I gulp, then take the thin wooden board from him.\n\n\n “Luuutz! Thank you so much for coming for meee!”\n\n\n “W… what?!”\n\n\n The instant I see Lutz waiting for me outside the temple, I’m filled with an indescribable sense of relief. Swept up in my emotions, I leap at him, hugging him tightly to convey my heartfelt gratitude. He staggers a little bit, but manages to withstand it. As I press my head into his shoulder, Lutz sighs.\n\n\n “Did you do something again?”\n\n\n “…I think so, yeah. I have no idea what I did, but I think I blew myself up in the most spectacular way possible.”\n\n\n He pats me on the head, then grins at me.\n\n\n “Master Benno’s waiting for you, with a smile that made it look like the veins on his forehead were going to explode.”\n\n\n “Huh? …Can I just go home? I’m already really tired.”\n\n\n “He told me to bring you even if I had to drag you by the scruff of your neck. Your color’s still looking pretty good, you’ll be fine.”\n\n\n “Aaaaaarghhh…”\n\n\n Going to the temple had already frayed my nerves, yet now all of the warning flags that I’m going to be lectured by Benno have been raised. I trusted Lutz as my steadfast ally, but now I feel so betrayed.\n\n\n Feeling like a calf being led back to its cage, I’m brought to Benno’s shop. As if he’d been laying in wait for me, I’m immediately brought back into his office. I’m told to sit in the same chair I usually do. Across from me sits Benno. Behind him stands Mark. Lutz, instead of sitting next to me, sits next to Benno.\n\n\n “It’s been a while, hasn’t it, Ma?ne.”\n\n\n “…Y-yes.”\n\n\n “Now then, I have a mountain of things I want to say to you…”\n\n\n I brace myself. It seems like this is going to be a very long conversation. Benno takes a long, slow breath, then opens his mouth to speak.\n\n\n “Before I get started, I have a message from Corinna. She said she’d like to see the dress and hairpin you wore to the baptismal ceremony. It was a very unique outfit. Very eye-catching! What were you thinking, wearing something like that?”\n\n\n “It was a hand-me-down from Tuuli that we’d altered. There was no real meaning to it. I don’t particularly mind showing it to her, but I don’t know what my mother, who made it, would think of bringing it out. I would have to ask her.”\n\n\n “I see,” he says, lightly. “Well, please do so.”\n\n\n He folds his hands together on the table in front of him. He leans forward slightly, staring at me evenly.\n\n\n “Well, how about you just tell me everything? I have to figure out just what to do with you after I hear about whatever happened at the temple.”\n\n\n “Huh? Did Lutz not tell you?”\n\n\n It’s already been a few days since the baptismal ceremony. I thought he would have asked Lutz about it a long time ago, but it seems like he hasn’t heard anything.\n\n\n “Second-hand information always gets warped along the way. If I’ve got the chance to ask the actual primary source herself, why would I need to ask Lutz? Besides, there’s always the possibility that there’s some things you’re still keeping hidden.”\n\n\n He looks at me like a wild animal looks at his prey, and my breath freezes in my throat. It seems like he’s going to pursue me relentlessly.\n\n\n “…Where should I start?”\n\n\n “After you collapsed during the ceremony. Tell me everything that happened after you got separated from Lutz, and don’t leave anything out.”\n\n\n I tell him about how I collapsed, got lost searching for a restroom, and blundered into the nobles’ space. When I tell him about meeting the priestess and finding a library, his eyes widen in amazement.\n\n\n “A library? I didn’t think the temple had something like that…”\n\n\n “You didn’t know, Mister Benno?”\n\n\n “Wandering aimlessly around in an area used by the nobility is the kind of extremely dangerous behavior that ordinary people usually don’t do. Reflect on your own stupidity. What would you have done if you’d gotten yourself in actual danger?”\n\n\n “Ngh…”\n\n\n It’s true, that wasn’t somewhere that ordinary people would come and go from, so when I look at it from where Benno’s standing I can see that he’s right. Of course, getting lost is what caused me to find the library, so for me it was actually a really good thing.\n\n\n “The priestess told me that only people connected to the temple were able to enter the library, so I thought that I should become a priestess as quickly as possible, so I went to the temple master immediately to appeal to him.”\n\n\n “Use your damned head! You thoughtless little girl!”\n\n\n “Ow, dat hurds! Dat hurds!”\n\n\n Benno leans forward and starts pulling on both of my cheeks. Both Mark and Lutz look like they think this is a completely reasonable response, and neither of them lift a finger to help me. I rub my stinging face, and Benno, looking displeased, urges me on.\n\n\n “And then? You got permission?”\n\n\n “He told me that if I got my parents’ approval and gave him a donation, he’d let me become an apprentice priestess.”\n\n\n “A donation? Did you do it?”\n\n\n He frowns sharply, looking very stern. I can tell that he’s concerned that I thoughtlessly made a donation without having actually gotten permission first. To put him at ease, I puff up my chest proudly and give him my answer.\n\n\n “No sir, not yet. Based on a rough estimate of the price of the books and the amount of money I presently have, I calculated a usage fee for the library. I told them that I could donate up to one large gold coin, but that’s it; I have yet to actually make the donation. I’m not the kind of idiot that would hand over my money without knowing for sure that I’d actually be able to join!”\n\n\n I’d planned to put him at ease, but Benno, followed shortly by Mark and Lutz, gives me a pained look, as if he suddenly has a massive headache, then slumps his shoulders.\n\n\n “I shouldn’t need to tell you that you’re a colossal idiot when it comes to money.”\n\n\n “But thanks to that they treated me very well…”\n\n\n “Well of course they did!”\n\n\n I’d thought that it was a large sum, but it seems that the amount of money I’d presented is mind-bogglingly huge, even to a major merchant.\n\n\n “Then, when I went home and talked with my parents, they said that being a priest or a priestess is a job for orphans, and got really mad and told me no.”\n\n\n “Well, they’re right, aren’t they?”\n\n\n “The head priest said that there were noble children there too, though.”\n\n\n I tilt my head, not entirely understanding the reason why my father would have gotten so angry. Benno scratches roughly at his head, then explains to me some things about the clergy.\n\n\n “You noticed that the clergy was wearing blue and gray robes, right?”\n\n\n “I did.”\n\n\n “The ones wearing blue robes are nobles, the ones wearing gray are orphans. The gray priests and priestesses are effectively slaves working at the temple, making no wages, and serving as attendants and assistants to the blue ones.”\n\n\n “Uh?!”\n\n\n I’d been thinking that the color difference was due to apprenticeships or formalities. I hadn’t even considered that there would be this kind of distinction.\n\n\n “If you, who are not a noble, joined the clergy, you’d be a gray-robed sister-in-training. Of course you’d be cut off from your parents.”\n\n\n I gulp noisily. Now I know why my father had gotten so agitated. It’s not just that it’s obviously work that I am not at all capable of doing, so of course my doting father would be disgusted at the idea of my joining the temple.\n\n\n “So, Lutz tells me that you went to the temple today to reject their offer, but did you really do it?”\n\n\n “…Ummm, I mentioned that I had the devouring, and they brought out some sort of golden chalice that one of the stone statues in the hall of worship was holding, and then when I touched it it started glowing, and then they gave me a written invitation to take to my parents.”\n\n\n Benno firmly massages his temples, breathing an enormous sigh.\n\n\n “…Well, now they really will bring you in. You should be thrilled, you’ll live a long and happy life. That’s some great luck.”\n\n\n “Ummm…?”\n\n\n I tilt my head curiously when he tells me that getting brought in by the church is good luck. Benno broods over something, ignoring the fact that I don’t really understand what he means. He suddenly raises his head, looking straight at me with utter seriousness.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, what would you say to signing a magical contract with me? Saying that the goods you produce will be sold through this shop.”\n\n\n “…Why?”\n\n\n The sudden appearance of terms like “contract magic” immediately puts me on guard. Benno strokes his chin, looking at me.\n\n\n “If we let things go as they are, you’ll be captured by the nobility. If we want to put them in check, we’ll need contract magic to do that.”\n\n\n “…When we did the contract magic before, were you maybe thinking that I was going to be captured by the nobility?”\n\n\n “No, that was just insurance. I had no idea what kind of kids you were, so my first priority was to make sure I drew the boundaries as clearly as possible. …However, I did think there was a chance you had the devouring, and if you were going to live for a long time you’d need to make a contract with a noble. I thought it might be useful leverage against whatever nobleman you contracted with.”\n\n\n It seems that him making a magical contract with me and Lutz, who weren’t anywhere near his equals, was based on a hypothesis that the nobility might step in at some point.\n\n\n “But I never made a contract with any nobles, though?”\n\n\n “You haven’t made any contact with nobles until now, so you were able to make that decision yourself, but if you’re taken in by the temple then that’s all over. You need to start planning around being captured. I don’t think there’s a single noble alive that would pass up on the chance to take in a girl who invents things like you do and also has the devouring. Now, especially.”\n\n\n “What do you mean by ‘now’?”\n\n\n “This is news that I’m only just starting to hear recently, but…” he says, lowering his voice a little. “The lord of this town has been proclaiming neutrality in this, saying it doesn’t have anything to do with him, so there hasn’t been a lot of impact here, but it sounds like the bigger, more central territories are caught up in an enormous power struggle. There’s a huge political purge happening, so the ranks of the nobility are really starting to thin out, or so I hear.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n The conversation got really dangerous all of a sudden. I try to pull out my knowledge of history, but I can’t really make any guesses as to what kind of era we’re in in the first place or how things might actually unfold. I’m caught in a maelstrom with neither any information nor ability to take a step back and look at things from above.\n\n\n “Of course, in order to fill up the holes that these nobles are leaving behind, members of branch families are being sought out, heirs are being adopted, and marriages are being held to build new ties and interests. All sorts of people, money, and things are going into motion. So, since there aren’t that many people, all of the outcast nobility that got sent off to be blue-robed priests and priestesses are being called back into noble society. Can you guess what’s happening to the temple now?”\n\n\n Benno stares at me, and I tilt my head to the side. I look over to Mark and Lutz for help, but Mark is simply smiling demurely, and Lutz looks just as confused as I am.\n\n\n “Umm, so is there something bad about what would happen if there’s no nobility in the temple? I don’t really know how the temple is organized, or what kind of work they do. Wouldn’t it be a good thing for the gray-robed priests if there’s fewer people around to work them so hard?”\n\n\n “First of all, there would be fewer donations. Also, if there’s fewer people to use the orphans, then those orphans won’t have any work, and it’ll be difficult for them to even just keep living.”\n\n\n “That’s really bad, isn’t it?!” I blurt out, far louder than I was intending.\n\n\n Benno sighs, shaking his head. “It gets worse. That chalice they had you touch? The priests call it a ritual object, but practically it’s a magical tool. The blue-robed priests and priestesses pour their mana into it when they use it for their spring prayers, but that power’s been dwindling. When that happens, the harvests don’t produce as much food.”\n\n\n “Whaaat?!”\n\n\n I had no idea that that chalice was connected to such an absurdly important thing. I’d been startled by how it had glowed, but I was just thinking that it was purely an expensive, decorative thing, meant to show off the temple’s majesty. It’s a necessary tool for ensuring the existence of a bountiful harvest. If the harvest shrinks, then the people who will be hit the hardest are going to be poor people like me and Lutz.\n\n\n “Before the coup, there were plenty of noble children sitting around. To the magic-monopolizing nobility, kids with the devouring were nothing more than eyesores. However, with fewer nobles, it becomes harder to make use of magical tools, so now kids with the devouring are extremely important to the temple.”\n\n\n “Um, sorry, but, what does the devouring have to do with magic?”\n\n\n Benno’s jaw drops in sheer astonishment. He looks like he can’t believe what I’m asking him.\n\n\n “Did you… seriously not know? The devouring is what happens when built-up mana in the body starts acting violently.”\n\n\n “Whaaat?!”\n\n\n “Focusing mana into a magical tool how you make yourself able to control your power again.”\n\n\n “This is the first I’ve ever heard of it…”\n\n\n It seems like I’m some sort of magical girl! Having tremendous magical powers is the kind of thing that reincarnation is supposed to get me, isn’t it? This is finally time for my grand reveal! I’ll blast away my enemies with my overflowing mana, and cast a tremendously flashy spell… wait, do I even have any enemies?\n\n\n My thoughts drift off to a far away place thanks to this new information, but Benno bops me on the head, telling me to pay attention.\n\n\n “It’s common for nobles with more powerful mana to be higher-ranked, and weaker mana to be lower-ranked. Plus, the poorer nobles don’t have enough money to get magical tools ready for all of their children. It’s not uncommon for a family to only keep the kids with the strongest magic around as their heirs, and send the rest of their kids off to the temple.”\n\n\n In other words, right now, the blue-robed priests in the temple are nobles whose parents weren’t able to raise them and had cast them out. Everyone would be in trouble if they weren’t there, but still, that’s a sad way to live.\n\n\n “Ultimately, until now, the temple had been performing their miracles by just throwing bodies at the problem, since the nobles there didn’t have a whole lot of mana. However, now that there’s less and less of them, the burden on each person is a lot higher. If they’re not careful, they might wind up in a state where they don’t have enough mana to make everything work. How many blue-robed priests were there are your ceremony?”\n\n\n “Ten, I think.”\n\n\n The memory of so many men proudly doing the Glico pose, destroying my sides, is still fresh in my mind.\n\n\n “There’s usually twenty of them, but this time there were ten. Plus, since it’s the ones who have more mana that are getting called home, I bet you can guess how much mana the people who aren’t getting called back have. There’s no doubt about it: they’re so desperate that they’re practically begging on their hands and knees for someone with the devouring and lots of mana to show up. However, this is probably temporary. Keep in mind that there’s only a few years between this current thinning of the ranks and when any new nobles born after this point come of age.”\n\n\n “Yeah…”\n\n\n If it’s a short period of time, then perhaps I could bargain based on an offer to donate mana to the temple? I wonder how readily they’d accept a deal where I exchanged mana for access to the library…\n\n\n As I hum to myself, deep in thought, Benno somehow manages to walk around behind me without me noticing, and he starts grinding his fist into my skull.\n\n\n “Are you even listening to me?!”\n\n\n “Ow ow ow!”\n\n\n “You have mana, money, and inventions. Have a little bit of self-awareness! You’d be the tastiest snack for the nobility!”\n\n\n I straighten up when I hear how serious his tone is. Benno sighs, withdrawing his fist, then shakes his hand.\n\n\n “That’s why I’m saying that making a contract before you get taken in by the nobility is the best thing to do for your sake.”\n\n\n “…What would the contract be for?”\n\n\n “Guaranteeing that the goods you make will be sold through Lutz.”\n\n\n “Huh? What do we need that for?”\n\n\n What this has to do with the devouring or the temple, I have no idea. I frown, wondering if he’s trying to take advantage of my confusion to secure some profit for himself. Benno, however, sits back down across from me, and starts to explain his thinking for me.\n\n\n “Right now, this is just insurance. You’re careless, hasty, and thoughtless, and when that gets you caught up in some nobleman’s plans and dragged to the other side of the castle walls, this contract will guarantee that we can still communicate with you. Think of the case where you’re stuck in a contract with a nobleman, and we don’t have anything like this in place. You already know that in order to go inside the castle walls you need permission, right?”\n\n\n “I do,” I reply.\n\n\n Thanks to my work at the gates, I know that you need special authorization to enter the castle walls. I nod, and Benno gives me a small, wry smile.\n\n\n “The guild master’s granddaughter will still be able to meet with her family, even after she goes inside the castle walls, because they’re merchants who have been recognized by the nobility. What about your family, though?”\n\n\n I can answer with nothing but silence. The entire reason I didn’t make a contract with a nobleman is because I wouldn’t be able to see my family again. There’s no way I can answer that out loud.\n\n\n “I can’t think of a single way your family would be able to get inside the castle walls. However, at the very least, if we have the ability to make magical contract that not even the nobility can interfere with, then why not make a connection with Lutz before the temple or the nobility manage to take you away? If you do that, then I can use that contract as a pretext to take Lutz into the walls.”\n\n\n My eyes open wide, and I look at Benno, then Lutz. When I make eye contact with them, they both nod at me.\n\n\n “With Lutz as an intermediary, I can send you letters, verbal messages, or otherwise get in contact with you. You’ll be able to know how your family is doing. Best of all, I think, through Lutz’s information, your family won’t have to be so anxious about how you’re doing. Well, if you really wanted to make the contract with me instead, I don’t really care either way…”\n\n\n “If I were to make it with you, I don’t think you’d really know much about how my family is doing, would you?”\n\n\n I don’t want to imagine the possibility of being captured by the nobility, but, if that really did happen, then it wouldn’t be a bad thing for me to have already put things in place to be able to meet with Lutz. Freida had said something to that effect too, how even just being able to see her family was reassuring. However, is it really okay for me to be dragging Lutz into all of this?\n\n\n “What do you think, Lutz?” I ask.\n\n\n He shrugs. “I’d like to see the nobles’ quarter if I could, and I wouldn’t really mind being the person in charge of contacting you. I’d be worried if you were there all by yourself. I think I’d always have a headache, wondering what you’re getting yourself into.”\n\n\n It seems like he’d already decided he wanted to do this. However, this is a contract designed to keep the nobility in check. When I think of all of the extra burden Lutz would be put under if he was the other party in this contract, I can’t just follow along with this so easily.\n\n\n “Making a contract like this isn’t something you should be doing so freely, is it? You might suffer, or experience some awful things, right? Plus, Mister Benno, aren’t you not really making any profit all of this? If Lutz gets hired somewhere else, wouldn’t that be it for you?”\n\n\n When I taper my lips in dissatisfaction, Benno looks at me in amazement, sighs, and slowly shakes his head.\n\n\n “You’re not in such a carefree position that you can be worried about other peoples’ safety. Lutz will profit from this, and that should be fine.”\n\n\n “How would Lutz be profiting off of this?”\n\n\n “You don’t need to think about that. Think about what you stand to gain. Honestly, now that you’ve been given a written invitation, you don’t have very much time at all to get yourself ready.”\n\n\n Benno, who has much more information and a much broader view of things than I do, is plainly in much more of a hurry than I am. There’s a lot of things that will need to be done before I get taken in by the temple.\n\n\n “First, you’ll need to establish the Ma?ne Workshop, register you with the merchant’s guild as its proprietor, and secure a market for your goods. If they changed how they were treating you when money got involved, then when you negotiate with the temple you’ll need to make sure you establish a way to make money. They’re strapped for cash as well, it seems, so depending on how negotiations go you’ll be able to work something out.”\n\n\n It’s true, that’s one of the benefits of having large amounts of money. Since their interactions with me got so much more polite as soon as I mentioned how much gold I could bring to bear, it would be best if I came to the table bringing money in order to protect myself. Also, even if I were to keep making things, if the temple takes all of it, then there won’t be anything left for me to profit from. I need an outlet for my goods that I can trust. Even though Benno has been constantly testing me and I keep bumbling into his traps, he’s still the most reliable partner that I have.\n\n\n I nod, and he nods back.\n\n\n “You’ll need to be careful of the fact that a single commoner isn’t worth much to a noble. If you can think of a path that will help you survive, secure it, and keep all of your routes of escape open. If you can think of any way to guarantee your life, any way at all, do it. Protect yourself.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir.”\n\n\n The head priest let me sit on his lap and read the scriptures to me and the temple master interacted with me so politely, so I can’t help but think that the two of them are fundamentally good people, but there’s no harm in making sure I’ve got guarantees and escape routes set up for myself. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, after all. I’m vexed, though; I don’t have enough local common sense or information to know exactly how to prepare.\n\n\n Benno watches me closely, then continues to speak.\n\n\n “Right now there’s ten nobles in the temple, aren’t there? Don’t just let yourself be exploited by them. Find someone among them that you can use. If you get snatched up by the nobility, you’ll just be kept under their control until you die, so broaden your options, even just a little bit. Watch them carefully, then pick someone. Think. Don’t just float along aimlessly. Struggle to survive.”\n\n\n “Mister Benno, why’re you going so far for me…?”\n\n\n These countermeasures that he’s laying out for me aren’t something that he could just spout off the top of his head without having carefully gathered information and given it a lot of thought. I can’t understand why he would go to all this effort for someone like me, especially now that I’m not going to be an apprentice at his shop.\n\n\n “If you keep living, you’ll be making new products. If you’re connected to this shop, I’ll profit off of that. You’ll be able to get information out of this too, which you’ll turn into your own profit, won’t you? Just shut up and listen.”\n\n\n Benno starts to sulk, but Mark, standing behind him, laughs quietly, wearing a wry smile.\n\n\n “Master Benno is simply worried about you. You could get into trouble or cause unexpected things to happen at any time, really; watching you is very hard on one’s heart.”\n\n\n “Shut up, Mark,” growls Benno, looking at Mark over his shoulder.\n\n\n Mark gives him a thin smile, then continues to speak. “The children who usually apprentice at this store are generally taught all of the fundamentals by their own families. Until now, there haven’t been any children that he’s needed to watch over so closely. He’s certainly not treating you like he would treat his own children, but he does worry about you with the same care that he would have for any of his relatives’ children. Of course, the same applies to me as well.”\n\n\n “Thank you very much, Mister Mark,” I reply, deeply grateful.\n\n\n “Just Mark?!”\n\n\n When I convey my heartfelt gratitude, Benno interjects, sulking even harder. Mark and I exchange glances, and I can’t help but laugh.\n\n\n “Of course I’m grateful to you too, Mister Benno! …So, please, help me with the contract magic and registering my workshop with the guild.”"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “The contract is ready, Master Benno.”\n\n\n “Alright.”\n\n\n Mark has finished the necessary arrangements for the contract magic. A piece of parchment, sized for a magical contract, has been spread out on the table, and set next to it is a special inkwell, the design of which I recognize from before. Benno dips his pen into the inkwell, then smoothly begins to write the contract. Just like I remember, the ink isn’t black, but a vivid blue. When it’s ready, I take a look over the finished contract.\n\n\n The right of sale for all goods produced by Ma?ne’s Workshop is exclusively granted to Lutz.\n\n\n Establishing a proxy requires the acknowledgement of Ma?ne, Lutz, and Benno, and must be registered with the merchants’ guild.\n\n\n “What is this sentence for?” I ask, pointing at the contract.\n\n\n Benno raises his eyebrows. “Insurance. If the contract’s just between kids, then we’ll see people who think that they can intimidate you two with violence or kidnapping in order to tear it up. Dragging me and the guild into it will give you a little bit more protection against that kind of fraud. When you make contracts like this, try to find a trustworthy ally that you can use as a third party on the contract. You should remember that.”\n\n\n “…Thank you very much,” I reply.\n\n\n He’s already going to the trouble of setting up a magical contract. I didn’t think he’d put himself in a position to get dragged into it too. I take the pen that Mark offers me, and sign my name at the bottom. Lutz signs his name next, followed by Benno, who seals his signature with his blood.\n\n\n “Lutz, could you…?” I ask.\n\n\n I squeeze my eyes tightly shut, and Lutz pricks my finger with his knife. As my bright red blood starts spreading across my fingertip, I press it firmly on top of my signature. Just like before, the instant my blood touches the parchment, it’s absorbed, and the blue ink of my signature turns black. Then, just like before, once everyone has signed and sealed the contract, the ink shines dazzlingly. The parchment seems to burn away, as if the ink had ignited it, and as the holes spread across the contract it disappears into nothingness.\n\n\n As the glittering embers wink out, Benno lets out a long, slow sigh.\n\n\n “For now, this gives us a good justification to make sure you two can meet, supposedly to sell goods, even if you get taken to the nobles’ quarter. Ma?ne, now it’s up to you to think of ways to make sure that doesn’t happen.”\n\n\n “I’ll do my best,” I say, clenching my fist.\n\n\n Despite my show of confidence, Benno, Lutz, and Mark all give me extremely concerned looks.\n\n\n “Unfortunately, this’ll only work on people who actually think your goods have value.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n “If you’re up against someone who literally only cares about your mana, then they could just declare that you don’t need to do any sort of buying or selling of goods at all. …Luckily, I don’t think any of the nobility around here are rich enough to be able to just ignore a large source of potential income that they don’t even have to put any effort into. Also, this bears repeating: the magic of this contract only works within the walls of this town. Be careful.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir,” I say.\n\n\n After that, we write out copies of the contract on ordinary parchment. These will be used to notify the merchants’ guild, and although they won’t have any binding power over the nobility, if something were to happen in another town, these can be used to show that a contract already exists.\n\n\n “Let’s take care of the formalities today. We’ll head to the merchants’ guild now, to register Ma?ne’s Workshop as a workshop and get you instated as its head. Once we do that, you won’t have any troubles buying and selling goods. Also, if you demonstrate that you have alternatives besides going to the temple, as well as the ability to earn money on your own, you’ll be able to be a little more stubborn when negotiating.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir,” I say.\n\n\n The merchants’ guild is on my way home, so if I can drop by there and take care of all of these formalities, then that’ll give me a little peace of mind. Benno tells Lutz to go get ready to leave immediately, and Lutz rushes upstairs to his storeroom to get changed.\n\n\n I look up at Benno. “How do you make sure negotiations turn out well?” I ask.\n\n\n “Good question. …First, always keep in mind what the absolute best outcome you could imagine would be. Then, use that to figure out what you need your opponent to give you. In return, you need to understand what you have to offer, and then figure out what they need.”\n\n\n Listening to Benno, I try to imagine what I really want out of this. My goal is to be able to enter and browser the library. To make that happen, I’d like to join the temple, albeit not as a gray-robed priestess who would be expected to perform physical labor. What I can offer to them is mana and money and, if Benno’s information is correct, mana and money is what they need.\n\n\n We should be able to work something out, right?\n\n\n “…Ah, that reminds me,” I say, “the temple master said that it’s not okay for someone to join the temple if they’re already members of another guild. He said that he would talk with the guild master about that, but I wonder how that turned out? I wonder if I’ll be able to register?”\n\n\n When I suddenly recall what the temple master had told me, Benno sternly chops me on the head.\n\n\n “Oi, Ma?ne. Stop passing off your work onto others. Actually put in the time to make sure you’re securing your advantage. You have no idea what kind of ridiculous conditions might get put on you, do you?”\n\n\n “You’re right. To be honest, I hadn’t thought that the chalice was a magical tool and that I might wind up being able to live a long life, so I was really just thinking that I had about a half of a year left. I see now that I was being careless.”\n\n\n Now that I’ve found a way to prolong my life, though, and since I’ve found a library, I’m significantly more determined than I was before.\n\n\n “Don’t let that determination go to waste. Use your head.”\n\n\n “I’ll be careful.”\n\n\n Lutz runs back down the stairs. Based on how hard he’s panting, he must really have been rushing. I look up at the seven story building and can’t help but be impressed at his speed. If I were to run all the way up and down those stairs, I know I’d immediately collapse.\n\n\n “Alright, let’s go.”\n\n\n Benno grabs me by my sides and, as if this was his expectation all along, picks me up. Since Otto had told me that my walking speed was almost unbearably slow for a grown man to keep pace with, lately I’ve just been letting myself be carried without complaining at all. Resisting would be pointless; it would only just tire me out.\n\n\n “If nobody at the temple is allowed to be in any guilds, then that means that you’ll be the only person at the temple able to deal with the merchants’ guild. If you can’t push past their objections by saying you’re already registered, then just dazzle them with money until they approve of your workshop.”\n\n\n Benno seems to want to waste no time whatsoever, so as we walk towards the merchants’ guild he lays out countermeasures and negotiation strategies, one after another. I really want to be taking notes but, regrettably, I can’t. I keep my eyes fixed on him, hoping to force as many brain cells as possible into operation to try to retain just a little more of this flood of information.\n\n\n “I said this before, but there’s a high probability that since there’s fewer blue priests, there won’t be as much work for the orphans to do, and there won’t be as many donations coming in. Lay out all sorts of nice-sounding reasons, like, ‘I want to help the orphans find a better path’, or 'I want to give them work to do’, or 'I want to make their lives better’. That’ll help you get approval for your workshop. The temple should be well aware of the fact that no matter what they do, they’ll need money to do it.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir,” I say.\n\n\n “Incidentally, make them guarantee that you’ll have labor. Say things like 'I’ll put them to work’, or 'I won’t have anyone to look after my health so I won’t be able to do much on my own’, or whatever. Come up with ten or twenty different ways to say that single fact. Keep in mind that Lutz is already working at my shop, you won’t have him for half the week.”\n\n\n “Ahh, I see…”\n\n\n He lays out individual, concrete, easy-to-understand plans. I nod along, sorting them out in my head. Say pretty things to secure my ability to run a workshop, and exaggerate my weakness to secure a labor force. Certainly, even if I do have a workshop, I won’t be able to do everything by myself.\n\n\n “If people start understanding that these kids are able to put in honest work at a workshop despite being orphans, then there’s a possibility that other workshops are going to be willing to take in orphans as well. If new products show up on the market, and people hear that those were made by orphans, then people might start to change their minds. That’s entirely dependent on your own skill.”\n\n\n “Understood. I’ll do my best.”\n\n\n I’m a little moved by how Benno seems to not just be thinking about me, but about the orphans as well. He sighs, though, shaking his head.\n\n\n “Hah… there’s got to be limits to how easily you get swept up in things, right? Don’t just take on every problem you come across. Decide what your priorities are.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n I blink, surprised at how quickly Benno’s opinion seemed to have changed, and he raises an eyebrow at me. It seems that this was some sort of test.\n\n\n “Until you’ve determined what your own position in the temple is going to be, you need to put your own interests above those of the orphans. Rather, think of how you can use those orphans and make them into your supporters. This isn’t particularly nice to say out loud, but there’s a lot more people worried about what might happen to you than people caring about those orphans, after all.”\n\n\n “…I see.”\n\n\n As I nod in comprehension, we arrive at the merchants’ guild. The door creaks as Lutz opens it for us, and Benno frowns a bit.\n\n\n “If you’re making something new, or if something’s giving you trouble, or if you need something, come talk to me. It’ll cost you, of course, but I’ll do whatever I can to help.”\n\n\n “Thank you very much, Mister Benno. That means a lot to me.”\n\n\n Since it’s almost evening, the second floor of the guildhall is nearly empty, and we’re able to pass through it quickly to head up to the counter on the third floor. I return my temporary guild card, and hand over all of the forms that Benno had prepared before my baptism to complete processing. The paperwork is thoroughly filled out, designating Benno’s shop as the establishment I’ll be trading with, and Lutz’s name specified as the point of contact with whom I will be negotiating.\n\n\n “Oh my, if it isn’t Ma?ne! What might you be here for?”\n\n\n Freida’s light-pink pigtails sway as she descends the staircase, perhaps coming from the guild master’s office. She notices me as I towards the bookshelf in the meeting area, then rushes over to see me.\n\n\n “Since your baptismal ceremony is complete, I thought you might come here to handle your registration, but I haven’t heard any news of you! I was worried that you might have collapsed in the middle of the ceremony.”\n\n\n “Heh heh, good guess. I really did collapse during the ceremony. I’m finally better now.”\n\n\n I chuckle, ashamedly, finding Freida’s accurate prediction just a little bit funny. She shoots a glare at Lutz, who is looking at a map spread out on the table.\n\n\n “Lutz was there with you, but you still collapsed?”\n\n\n “Oh, it wasn’t Lutz’s fault at all. Really, it was my fault this time.”\n\n\n I first collapsed because I couldn’t contain my laughter, and then collapsed again after getting far too excited over having found a library, so this was absolutely all my fault. I feel so bad about making her worry that I want to prostrate myself in apology.\n\n\n “Hey, Ma?ne. They’re calling for you,” says Lutz.\n\n\n It seems that while I was talking with Freida they finished getting my new guild card ready. Freida goes behind the counter to get back to work, and I approach the counter to get an explanation. They tell me that the information from my previous card has been transferred over to the new one, but I’ll need a new blood seal on this one. Hearing this causes my breath to catch in my throat.\n\n\n “Just do it, Ma?ne,” says Lutz.\n\n\n I surrender my hand to be pricked by the needle, and when the blood runs over my thumb I press it against the card. With a flash of light, registration is complete. It’s a simple process, but a painful one. After I pay the registration fee of five small silver coins, the differences between my temporary card and my new workshop head’s card are explained to me. Freida lurks close by, looking like she has some objection to make.\n\n\n “Oh my, 'Ma?ne’s Workshop’? You decided against joining Mister Benno’s shop as an apprentice merchant, is it?”\n\n\n “I gave up on that, since it looked like a physically demanding job.”\n\n\n “Ah, perhaps Ma?ne’s Workshop could sell its goods wholesale to my shop, then?”\n\n\n Freida immediately gets a sharp gleam in her eyes. Confronted by her suddenly merchant-like expression, I glance away a little.\n\n\n “Ahhh, I’m sorry. Ma?ne’s Worshop is going to be selling its goods through Lutz, to Mister Benno’s shop.”\n\n\n “…Lutz again, I see.”\n\n\n She frowns in dissatisfaction, lips tapering to a point, but what’s done is already done. I’ve already given her monopoly rights on pound cake, so I’d really like for her to give up on this.\n\n\n “I already gave you pound cake, didn’t I? How’s that coming along? Does it look like you’ll be able to sell it?”\n\n\n “Yes, Ilse is in quite high spirits as she’s been experimenting with flavors. It seems like she might want to hear your opinion on it before we put it up for sale. You absolutely must come taste it. How about tomorrow?”\n\n\n I want to eat it, but. Sweet things are the perfect thing to eat when you’re tired, but. Until my negotiations with the temple have concluded, I don’t have the luxury of being able to head over to her place to sample her cake.\n\n\n “I appreciate the invitation, but I already have plans for tomorrow.”\n\n\n “Then, the next day, perhaps? If she can, perhaps your sister would like to join us. If she comes along, then Lutz wouldn’t need to come too, right?”\n\n\n She tries to dazzle me with a mention of Tuuli so that she can get Lutz excluded. Lutz glares at her, making a face that looks like he’s going to snap at her any minute. Come to think of it, she let Tuuli ride in the carriage last time, forcing us to leave Lutz behind, didn’t she.\n\n\n “Freida, don’t say mean things like that. Wouldn’t it wind up tasting better if everyone tried it? If Ilse is doing flavor research, then there’s going to be several different things to try, you know?”\n\n\n “That’s true, but…” she says, pouting in dissatisfaction.\n\n\n I start to describe the details of how a taste-testing might work, hoping to switch Freida’s thoughts from her emotions to a more mercantile mindset.\n\n\n “If you want to judge how close your product is to being ready to sell, as well as its potential sales, you should have as many people as you can taste it and get their feedback, I think. Kids and adults are going to want different kinds of flavors, and men and women are going to want different ones too.”\n\n\n “…Many people? How should I be serving it? Even if I were to throw a tea party, inviting a lot of people would be quite difficult.”\n\n\n Freida’s eyes are very merchant-like now. Unfortunately, even though all I had wanted to do was make sure Lutz could come as well, this seems to have turned into a tea party to which a lot of people might be invited. I want her to acknowledge Lutz’s invitation, so I keep piling on more suggestions.\n\n\n “It doesn’t have to be a tea party, does it? You could have various flavors of pound cake cut into bite-sized pieces, and then have everyone try them and ask them which they thought was the best. It’s more like a food-sampling party, so Lutz could—”\n\n\n “What a wonderful idea!”\n\n\n Before I can finish my sentence, Freida claps her hands, her eyes shining. She looks excited, even positively merry. Her expression is full of joy and happiness, but I can pretty distinctly see that she’s barely even paying attention to me anymore.\n\n\n “Huh? Freida?”\n\n\n “When I’ve settled on a date and time for the sampling party, I’ll be sure to send you an invitation. Of course, Lutz, to you as well. Ah! I’m going to be so busy! Well, Ma?ne, Lutz, farewell for now.”\n\n\n Freida, looking like she wants to immediately turn the ideas in her head into reality, turns around and runs back up the stairs. If I had to guess, she’s probably going to consult with the guild master. I honestly have no idea what she’s thinking or how wildly she’s going to be rampaging, but since her good mood made her feel like inviting Lutz along, I guess this was a success. I watch Freida as she leaves, thinking to myself how nice it will be to sample different kinds of cake after my negotiations are finished.\n\n\n Lutz sighs. “The two of you are really alike, you know?”\n\n\n Benno chuckles in agreement.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n By the time we successfully get through all of the formalities of registration and leave the merchants’ guild, it’s almost dark, despite the long summer days. Even the central plaza, which had been bustling when we arrived, has emptied out considerably, with few people coming and going. As we walk home, I watch the long shadows that we cast before us. I feel Lutz squeeze my hand a little tighter than normal.\n\n\n “What’s wrong?” I say.\n\n\n I stop walking and look up at him. When he looks back down at me, his face is twisted into a complicated expression, somewhere between being angry and being on the verge of tears. He grumbles quietly, almost to himself, the words falling into the shadows.\n\n\n “…Ma?ne, are you really going to the temple?”\n\n\n “Yeah, probably. If what Mister Benno says is true, then I don’t think they’d let me get away. That’s what he was predicting, right?”\n\n\n His lips tighten for a moment, then he looks at me with unease.\n\n\n “Can you really do those negotiations?”\n\n\n The shadows grow darker as the sun continues to set. In the deepening gloom, I can see that he’s even more uneasy, looking like he’s about to cry. I can feel that he’s been gradually squeezing my hand a little bit tighter, bit by bit. Hoping to ease his anxiety, even just a little bit, I smile brilliantly back at him.\n\n\n “Well, I’ve never negotiated with a nobleman before, so I don’t know how it’s going to turn out. But, if that chalice really is a magical tool, then that’ll help keep my devouring in check, so going to the temple will be good for me, I think, and I want to go there to read books, too! But, no matter how I think about it I can’t see myself being a gray-robed priestess, so it’ll really depend on how the negotiations go. I’m going to try my hardest to make sure I can make my living conditions better, if even a little bit.”\n\n\n “Yeah…”\n\n\n For an instant, Lutz almost looks like he’s in pain. He casts his eyes downward, and starts walking again. We continue on together, in silence, for a little while. Lutz lifts his head, pretending like he’s paying attention to where the sound of wagon wheels is coming from, but he’s making an expression like he’s swallowing down something that he really wants to say. As we keep quietly walking forward, I grow more and more curious.\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz. If you’ve got something to say, you can say it, you know? I’ll listen.”\n\n\n Lutz stops walking. He opens his mouth a bit, changes his mind, and thinks about it a little while, then looks away, frowning.\n\n\n “…I don’t want to. It’s pretty uncool.”\n\n\n “Alright, got it.”\n\n\n No matter how curious I am, it’s probably best if I respect his boyish instincts to be cool. I nod, and we keep walking.\n\n\n Again, we walk in silence. The sound of footsteps on cobblestone echo through the streets as people rush home, and from the various windows we pass I can hear the tumult of evening activities, but around just the two of us, everything seems so quiet. Perhaps the sun has finally set, or perhaps we’ve been swallowed up in the long shadows of the buildings, but our footsteps fall in darkness.\n\n\n “…You said we were going to make paper together, and books too, and then sell them, though. You lied.”\n\n\n Lutz mutters this as a wagon rides past us, perhaps hoping that his voice would be lost in the clattering of the wheels, but I hear him perfectly. His words, which he had wanted to say as our circumstances were constantly changing but couldn’t, strike home.\n\n\n “I’m sorry, Lutz.”\n\n\n “It’s not something you need to apologize for. I know I wasn’t strong enough to do anything. What Master Benno said is right, so I want to work with you however I can to make sure you don’t have to go through anything too dangerous.”\n\n\n He stops speaking, but I can hear him grinding his teeth.\n\n\n “…But, it still hurts. You said we were going to start a bookstore together…”\n\n\n “Yeah, you’re right. But, I’ve been thinking that since I want to read books, I have to make them. So even if I go to the temple, it’s not like I’m going to stop making books, you know? Rather, if I’m going to be living longer, that means I’m going to have to try harder, right? If I don’t get more books, I’m not actually fulfilling my dream, you know?”\n\n\n Lutz raises his head. His face is still screwed up like he’s trying not to cry, but he tries to smile at me, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\n “Your dream of surrounding yourself with books and just spending all your time reading them?”\n\n\n “Yeah, that one. You want to become a merchant, right? Become a merchant and get to go see all sorts of places, wasn’t it? I’ve got dreams, too.”\n\n\n When I say that we should keep working hard towards our dreams, Lutz looks even more like he’s about to start crying. Even in the twilight, I can clearly see that the tears in his eyes are on the verge of overflowing.\n\n\n “I want to help you with your dream. …But, I’ve been trying so hard because you were there with me. I wanted us to work hard together at Master Benno’s shop. I wanted to do so many more things together with you.”\n\n\n He hugs me tightly, burying his face in my shoulder. I can hear him desperately try to hold back his sobs.\n\n\n “It’s okay,” I say. “We can still do that, even if I join the temple. I’m absolutely going to make books, after all.”\n\n\n “No! That’s not it. I don’t want you to make them with someone else and just sell them with me, I want to make them together with you!”\n\n\n Lutz had been keeping his unhappiness dammed up, but now that dam is bursting. He shakes his head like a child throwing a tantrum, and my own chest starts feeling tight as tears well up in my own eyes. I hug him too, patting him gently on the back.\n\n\n “Nothing’s changed from before, you know? We decided already. Whatever I think up, you’ll make, right? When I’m going to make something, before I talk to Mister Benno, before I talk to anyone, I’m going to come talk to you first and ask if you want to help.”\n\n\n “Even though I can’t do anything?”\n\n\n He raises his head, looking surprised. I wipe some of the tears from his cheeks, giving him a small smile.\n\n\n “If you can’t do anything, then where does that leave me? Is there actually anything I can do? Besides, I don’t know what to do, or what even can be done; there’s really nobody I can work with to figure out if I can actually make something except for you, right? If you weren’t here, I’d be in big trouble.”\n\n\n “…That’s not right, though. I mean, people know that the things you make are valuable, so everyone’s going to want to help you.”\n\n\n Lutz looks away, frowning disinterestedly, rubbing his face to hide his tears as if he was ashamed that he’d just been crying. Perhaps because getting all of those things off of his chest left him feeling refreshed, or perhaps because he’s trying to shake off his embarrassment, he rolls his shoulders and shakes out his arms.\n\n\n “Nuh-uh,” I say, “even if someone else tried to make them, then things wouldn’t go so well, and I’d just wind up having to call for you anyway. So, I’m not just thinking that you’re going to be my middleman. Really, honestly, will you help me with my projects?”\n\n\n When I shrug my shoulders, Lutz finally smiles. He grabs me tightly by the hand, and walks forward through the quickly darkening streets, a brilliant smile on his face.\n\n\n “Everything’ll be just fine. I’ll make your stuff for you.”"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n When I get home, my entire family is waiting for me, extremely worried looks on their faces. The instant I open the front door, Tuuli and my mother let out sighs of relief. My father looks relieved as well, for a moment, but then raises his voice angrily.\n\n\n “Do you have any idea what time it is?! How worried did you want us to get?”\n\n\n “Sorry for making you worry, Daddy.”\n\n\n Since I had stayed out so late after listening to Benno telling me all those things about the temple, I fully recognize just how deeply worried my father must have been, so I immediately apologize. I take a sidelong glance at the dinner already sitting out on the table as I head towards the bedroom to put down my things. Now that I’ve gotten home, both my hunger and fatigue have suddenly caught up to me.\n\n\n “I went to the temple, then I went to Mister Benno’s shop, and then I went to the merchants’ guild. That took so much time. I’m tired, and I’m really hungry, too.”\n\n\n I wash my hands and slowly make my way to the table. My father narrows his eyes at me, eyebrows knitted tightly together.\n\n\n “So just what happened, then?”\n\n\n My father’s question seems to be the one on the entire family’s mind. Both my mother and Tuuli look at me uneasily.\n\n\n “I’ll tell you everything, but can I eat first? I’m hungry, and it’s a long story.”\n\n\n “…Alright.”\n\n\n Everyone eats their dinner in gloomy silence, whether it’s because they’re caught up in brooding over things or just because they’re dissatisfied with having to wait until after dinner. I wrack my brains, looking for a cheerful topic of conversation, and suddenly find one. If I talk about Corinna, we’ll surely have at least a slightly more lively conversation.\n\n\n “Hey, um, Mommy. Today, when I went to Mister Benno’s shop, he asked me to tell you something. He said that Miss Corinna wanted to see the dress I wore to the baptismal ceremony and my hairpin, too. Can I show them to her?”\n\n\n My mother drops her soup spoon, and it clatters noisily as it hits her bowl. Her eyes go wide and she starts looking around the room frantically, her face turning bright red as she starts frantically shaking her head.\n\n\n “W… what?! Th… that’s not something that I’d be fine showing Miss Corinna at all!”\n\n\n “…Oh, okay. I’ll tell Mister Benno you said no, then.”\n\n\n I thought that she might be a little bit hesitant, but I had no clue that she’d give such an adamant rejection. I feel bad for making my mother this flustered, so it’s probably best that we turn down the request.\n\n\n Even though I thought I was being kind by saying that, it only served to make my mother even more flustered. She frantically waves her hands, her eyes darting around everywhere.\n\n\n “N… no, wait, Ma?ne! We can’t just refuse. Hold on a bit. Aaargh, I can’t decide how to answer!”\n\n\n My mother is in complete shambles. It seems like she’s happy that Corinna is praising her, but because she’s dealing with someone so spectacularly above her in society, she has no idea how to react. I smile a little, having figured out what she’s thinking. Seeing her like this, so far from her usual demeanor, is pretty funny, and also a little cute. I amuse myself watching her panic, muttering to herself as she flips back and forth between all her options while her dinner goes untouched before her. Tuuli, sitting next to me, pokes me in the arm.\n\n\n “Hey, Ma?ne. Does that mean you’re going to bring it to her house?”\n\n\n “Probably, yeah?”\n\n\n Since my mother herself said that we can’t refuse, then it’s probably safe to assume that she’s decided that we’ll be showing Corinna my dress and hairpin. I don’t know if my mother would come along, or if it would just be me, but someone is going to have to bring them to her. There’s probably no way that she’d come here to see them.\n\n\n Tuuli looks at me with wide eyes that glitter with radiant hope, hands clasped in front of her chest. I tilt my head curiously, wondering why she’s deploying her strongest, most maximally cute begging style.\n\n\n “What’s up?”\n\n\n “Can I come too, this time?”\n\n\n Last time, when I delivered the rinsham to Corinna, the written invitation was addressed only to me. Tuuli, who had wanted to go, had to stay behind and keep an eye on the house. This time, though, we weren’t sent an actual written invitation. So, when I go to Benno to deliver our reply, then maybe it would be okay if I ask if Tuuli could come along as well.\n\n\n “Miss Corinna is really nice, so I don’t think she’d say no if you came too, but… if I tell her in advance that you were the one who made the really big flower on my hairpin, then I think she’d say yes.”\n\n\n “You’re the best, Ma?ne! I love you!”\n\n\n The pure, innocent delight that shines from her face is astoundingly cute. As expected of our angel. To her, an apprentice seamstress, an established and charismatic seamstress like Corinna would obviously be someone to admire.\n\n\n As I look at Tuuli, my heart warming, my mother suddenly holds out her hand.\n\n\n “Hold on, you two. Please hold on. I haven’t even decided if we’re going yet…”\n\n\n “Huh? But you said we weren’t going to refuse, though?”\n\n\n “Well, yes, but, see…”\n\n\n The words falling out of my frantic mother’s mouth seem to have lost all meaning.\n\n\n “I think that Miss Corinna would have questions for the person who actually sewed the dress,” I say, “but… if you really don’t want to go, then you don’t have to, you know?”\n\n\n When I imply that only Tuuli and I would be going, my mother immediately shakes her head.\n\n\n “When did I say that I didn’t want to go?”\n\n\n “Okay!” I say, smiling widely. “Then I’ll tell Mister Benno that all three of us will come.”\n\n\n My mother is at a loss for words. Tuuli looks at her and giggles. I can’t help but start giggling too. My mother sighs resignedly, then laughs as well. My father, watching the three of us, smiles, but it’s a complicated smile, like he’s not laughing along.\n\n\n “Now then,” says my mother, once dinner has been cleaned up and tea has been served, “I think you had some things you were going to tell us.”\n\n\n In an instant, the cheerful mood vanishes and the room grows heavy. Everyone looks at me, urging me to start talking.\n\n\n “Ummm, let’s start from what happened at the temple. I told them that I wasn’t going to be a priestess, but then when they found out that I had the devouring, they said they wanted to speak to my parents and gave me this invitation. It’s for the day after tomorrow, on the third bell.”\n\n\n When my father looks at the wooden slip I pull from my bag, his face goes completely white. Since he works as a gatekeeper, he probably has seen countless written invitations like this before, and probably knows all too well what kind of meaning a written invitation from the temple master, a noble, carries.\n\n\n He stares at the official order of summons, his lips tight. “Ma?ne, what did you do?!”\n\n\n “I didn’t really do anything. All I did was talk, and they read the scriptures to me–”\n\n\n “You had a nobleman read to you? You–”\n\n\n “–I mean,” I say, pouting, “I didn’t know that the head priest was a noble!”\n\n\n When I go on to explain how I made the chalice shine, I can see in both of my parents’ faces that all life has left their bodies. It seems like this is far more than they can bear. I wave my hands in front of their empty eyes, tilting my head curiously.\n\n\n “Can I keep going?”\n\n\n My father comes back to his senses with a start. He shakes his head vigorously, as if to clear it.\n\n\n “Yeah, keep going,” he says, scratching his head.\n\n\n “After I went to the temple, I went to Mister Benno’s shop. Mister Benno knows a lot more about the devouring than me, and also knows a lot about the temple and the nobles, so he taught me a lot of things.”\n\n\n “What kind of things?”\n\n\n I glance around the table and see everyone looking at me suspiciously. I nod, and take a long, slow breath, in and out.\n\n\n “So, um, he said that the fever is caused by mana. And that means that I’m not going to be able to get away from the temple or from the nobles.”\n\n\n “That’s…”\n\n\n My mother and Tuuli clap their hands over their mouths, quivering in terror. I don’t know if they’re scared because it turns out I have magic, or if it’s because of the authority of the temple, but either way, I avert my eyes and continue.\n\n\n “But, if there’s magical tools at the temple, then if I go there I can live longer.”\n\n\n My father, my mother, and Tuuli all look at me with a mix of hope and fear. When I see them looking at me with worried eyes, not with fear over my having mana, all of the built-up tension leaves my body.\n\n\n “Hey, Ma?ne,” says Tuuli. “If you go to the temple, then even if you live a lot longer, we won’t be able to see you, right?”\n\n\n “At this rate, yeah…”\n\n\n Tuuli’s eyes start filling with tears as she shakes her head desperately.\n\n\n “What’s different from you being locked up by a nobleman, then?” says my father, sounding like he’s choking the words out. “I don’t want to send you to the temple.”\n\n\n It’s true, if things keep going along the same path that they have been, then there’s no reasonable outcome besides me being taken in as a gray-robed sister-in-training in exchange for my mana and my donation. It’s an outcome that is nothing but good for the temple.\n\n\n “Hey, Daddy. Do you know what’s happening in the other parts of the country? Did you hear about the coup, and how all the nobles are being shuffled around differently?”\n\n\n “There was a merchant saying something like that a few days ago. I’m a gatekeeper, so I hear about sorts of things, but… that doesn’t have anything to do with this, right?”\n\n\n As I wonder if Benno might have heard about this through Otto, I shake my head.\n\n\n “That’s why I’m being told to go to the temple. There’s not as many nobles around right now, and the temple needs mana in order to do their jobs. I don’t really know if what Mister Benno said is true or not, but you would, wouldn’t you?”\n\n\n My father’s breath catches in his throat, like he’d just remembered something. He strokes his chin, eyes cast down, thinking about something.\n\n\n “The nobles are definitely scattering to other places, hm. I’ve been seeing nobles leave, but lately, I haven’t been seeing any come back.”\n\n\n “So Mister Benno was right about that?” I mutter to myself. “Okay, then in that case, I think we can make this work.”\n\n\n “What do you mean?” asks my mother. The entire family leans forward expectantly.\n\n\n “Mister Benno said that I was lucky. The temple is in trouble because it doesn’t have many nobles left, so he said that I might be able to negotiate things so that I can get treated more like a noble.”\n\n\n “Tell me everything,” says my father. He has the serious, fierce look in his eyes that I’ve seen when he’s at work.\n\n\n I spell out everything that Benno told me in the finest detail that I can, in a way to make it easy to understand. I also tell them about the magical contract and the fact that my workshop has now been registered.\n\n\n “…So, although I don’t know if it’ll work until we try it, Mister Benno thinks that we might be able to play up how weak I am and get them to both treat me well and let me come and go as I want. He says that with the way things are for them right now, we should be able to get those kinds of concessions out of them. He told me that I need to struggle for my life.”\n\n\n My father’s eyes gleam. “Struggle for your life, huh? Now’s a great time to think like that, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “Yeah.”\n\n\n Emphasizing both my ability to provide them with magical power and my weakness, get them to treat me more like a noble.\n\n\n Emphasizing both my weakness and my love for my parents, get them to allow me to come and go.\n\n\n Emphasizing my ability to bring in money, get them to allow me to continue operating my workshop.\n\n\n “I’ve got other, more selfish goals, like being able to browse the library and avoid having to do any heavy labor, but even if we can only get those three down then I’d call that a win, I think.”\n\n\n “Got it. Let’s give that a shot. I became a soldier to protect all of the families in this town. If I can’t protect my own family, then what am I protecting? I’m going to do my absolute best to make sure you get to live.”\n\n\n His eyes burning with passion, my father gives me a confident grin, wearing the expression of a man with a hard battle before him.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, both of my parents go to their workplaces to ask for the day off. After how much I did the day before, it’s only natural that I could barely move, so I took the day to rest.\n\n\n The day after that is the day that we are to be summoned by the temple. My parents put on their only nice set of clothes, I put on the apprentice’s clothing that I have been using to go to Benno’s shop, and the three of us head towards the temple.\n\n\n “Keep me safe,” I tell my father.\n\n\n Like I’d seen the soldiers do at the gate, I make a fist, then bend my elbow as if flexing my bicep. My father looks down at me in amazement, watching me do what the soldiers do when they wish each other a victorious battle, then smirks. He makes a fist and bends his elbow as well, then strikes my fist with his own.\n\n\n “Leave it to me,” he says.\n\n\n It seems that people at the temple gates have already been told to expect us, because gray-robed priests are already there to guide us through the temple, leading us to the temple master’s room. We cut through the worship hall and through the part of the temples where commoners would be lodged, straight towards the area used by the nobility.\n\n\n The corridors around us gradually grow more grand as we pass through them. My father is full of determination, his temples quivering and his fists tightly clenched. My mother, looking nervously at my father’s expression, is pale with tension. I glance at the hand she’s holding mine with, and see that all the muscles on it are standing out, quivering.\n\n\n “Father B?sewanz,” says the gray-robed priest, “the girl Ma?ne and her parents have come to see you.”\n\n\n The priest opens the door for us. Inside, the temple master and head priest are seated at the table, waiting for us. In addition, behind the table are four gray-robed priests, standing in a line.\n\n\n I hadn’t known that they were orphans the other day, but even when I look at them knowing that now, they’re still so well-groomed that I wouldn’t be able to tell. I wonder if the treatment they get here isn’t actually all that bad? Either that or people serving as the attendants of nobles are required to have a neat personal appearance.\n\n\n “Good morning, Father,” I say to the temple master.\n\n\n “Ah, Ma?ne,” he greets me.\n\n\n Just as I remembered, he looks like a kindly old man when he greets me. However, when he looks at my parents, his eyes widen. He looks at them in disbelief, fists trembling.\n\n\n “And these are… your parents, if I’m not mistaken?” he says.\n\n\n “Yes, that’s correct.”\n\n\n “And what might their occupations be?”\n\n\n “My father is a soldier, and my mother is a dyer.”\n\n\n When I give him my answer, he looks them over, scrutinizing them so closely that it’s rather impolite. Then, he snorts dismissively, looking down his nose at them. Even though he hasn’t said anything, I can immediately tell that he’s looking down on them, thinking of them as mere commoners.\n\n\n I blink, shocked by how quickly his demeanor changed.\n\n\n There is not a trace of the kindly old man I saw a moment ago in this man’s expression as he suddenly starts sneering at us. I am suddenly faced with the reality of how wide the gulf is between our social status, and understand entirely that the entire reason he had been so kindly towards me was because of my money.\n\n\n “Alright, well, let’s get this over with quickly.”\n\n\n Without offering a greeting, without beckoning us to the table, while we are still standing just inside the room, he moves straight into the order of business. I wonder if this might be an ordinary sort of thing, but when I compare this sort of behavior to the kind temple master I’d known so far, I can’t help but frown.\n\n\n The head priest, sitting next to the temple master, is keeping his face neutral, so I can’t see any of the same sort of disdain in his eyes. However, he doesn’t seem inclined to stop the temple master, merely content to watch, expressionless. The temple master clears his throat, raising his eyebrows in a very self-important manner as he opens his mouth to speak.\n\n\n “I know Ma?ne had some interest in becoming a sister-in-training, but it seems like you have some sort of objections.”\n\n\n “That’s correct, sir,” says my father. “I don’t have any intention to put my beloved daughter in the same conditions as orphans.”\n\n\n My father is quietly returning the temple master’s dismissive stare with an intensity like sparks flying, but the temple master doesn’t seem to take any notice, ignoring my father’s attitude as he idly strokes his beard.\n\n\n “Hmph. That might be the case, but Ma?ne has the devouring. That means that if she doesn’t get magical tools, she won’t live much longer. There’s magical tools here at the temple. If you have any compassion, you’ll let her join the temple.”\n\n\n This is clearly an order, with no room for negotiation. His snide tone and his rude demeanor are very oppressive and I, unused to this sort of social stratification, can’t help but get irritated. I can tell that I’m not the only one getting irritated at how clearly we’re being looked down on, because my father twitches a little before he replies.\n\n\n “I must refuse. I will not let Ma?ne live in the same conditions as orphans.”\n\n\n “That’s correct,” adds my mother. “Even if she didn’t have the devouring, she’s still very frail. She collapsed twice during the baptismal ceremony, and after that was laid out with a fever for several days. She can’t survive here in the temple.”\n\n\n My mother’s hands are tense as she replies, ready to protect me. Refusing something a command like this despite the tremendous difference in social stature is basically putting their very lives on the line. Naturally, the temple master hadn’t expected to be so openly refused, let alone by both parents. He grows bright red with rage, all the way to the top of his balding head.\n\n\n “How impertinent! Be obedient and hand over your daughter!”\n\n\n This man is acting so indecently that I can’t even imagine that he could be a clergyman in any sort of church at all. My breath catches in my throat. I know that what we commoners are supposed to do when facing a nobleman like this is obediently bow our heads, but I really don’t want to acknowledge it. My father seems to be trembling in anger, but not a trace of it shows in his voice as he calmly refuses a second time.\n\n\n “I must refuse. There are many orphans here at the temple. They are worked hard, used as playthings, and ultimately discarded. I absolutely will not allow my daughter to be thrown into the midst of that.”\n\n\n When my father says that, my mother grips my hand painfully hard, nodding firmly. I’m so happy and proud of them that I can’t help but smile, but it looks like these words have only thrown oil onto the temple master’s fire.\n\n\n “You dare!” he yells. He looks over his shoulder at the gray-robed priests standing behind him. “Seize these impertinent parents, and lock up the girl!”\n\n\n I don’t know if he’s being too hasty or if he isn’t even thinking about this conversation anymore, but after having suddenly escalated the situation he stands up, quickly enough that his chair falls behind him.\n\n\n “Stand back,” says my father.\n\n\n He steps in front of me and my mother as the gray-robed priests come toward us. Thanks to the table between them and us, they can’t charge us all at once, so they come at us seconds apart from each other.\n\n\n The temple master looks at my father as he quickly adopts a fighting stance, and gives him an irritated smirk. “If you dare to strike a priest, then you shall be executed in the name of the gods!”\n\n\n “If it’s what I have to do to protect Ma?ne, then I’m ready to face the consequences.”\n\n\n He launches his fist directly into the stomach of the first priest to reach him, then when the priest starts to double over in pain, brings his knee up hard, directly into the man’s jaw, knocking him immediately unconscious. The second priest tries to get behind him, but he swings around, catching the man in the temple with the back of his fist before launching another kick.\n\n\n With strike after strike, he unhesitatingly went for their vitals, the clearly incompetent priests no match for his fluid, trained motions. There is no way that these priests, who spend most of their time taking care of nobles, could possibly be any match for my father, who has practiced fighting for countless hours as a soldier. The remaining two priests, perhaps unused to this kind of violence, look terrified of my father, inching backwards away from him.\n\n\n “Hmph, you can fight one or two people, but how many can you really hold out against?”\n\n\n The temple master sneers at my fathers resolve, throwing open the door to the room. I don’t know how he managed to summon them, but on the other side of the door are at least ten more priests, and all of them immediately rush into the room. When I see how victorious the temple master looks, something inside of me snaps.\n\n\n That is enough!\n\n\n My entire body flushes with heat, like my blood is suddenly boiling. Despite that, my mind remains clear, a strange serenity wrapping my thoughts. My anger has flooded every cell of my body.\n\n\n “‘You dare’, hm? That’s my line. Do not touch my parents.”\n\n\n When I take a step forward, the smugly-smiling temple master, the head priest who had been quietly observing this entire time, the priests pouring into the room… all of them, for some reason, turn to me in sudden fright."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Although my body seethes with a boiling fever, my head is cool and clear. I feel like my body is lighter than ever. When I stare directly at the temple master, haughtily standing by the door, I can clearly see all the blood drain from his face, turning him ghastly pale.\n\n\n Well, if you get like this just from being stared at, maybe you shouldn’t have threatened me with such horrible things, hm? Idiot.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, your mana is leaking out. Control your emotions!”\n\n\n The head priest, perhaps having seen the temple master quickly lose all color, stands up with a sudden clatter, face tight as he calls to me. I, hearing an unexpected voice from an unexpected direction, turn my gaze from the temple master towards the head priest. The instant the temple master leaves my field of vision, the sound of him collapsing heavily to the floor reaches my ears.\n\n\n It seems like now that I’ve looked away, the gray-robed priests who had been standing stock still, like they had been stitched to the spot, are suddenly free to move. I hear them rush over to the temple master, frantically asking if he’s okay. The sound of their voices echoes distantly in my ears as I look toward the head priest.\n\n\n “And just how do you expect me to do that?” I snarl at him, tilting my head to the side.\n\n\n He moans, clutching at his chest. “Urgh… like… you usually do?”\n\n\n “You called me out here to have a friendly conversation, and then suddenly start shouting orders and attacking us, and then when we dare to defend ourselves you threaten us with the death penalty. Please, enlighten me, how might I control my anger? I don’t quite understand how.”\n\n\n I snort disdainfully as I look away from the head priest and focus my gaze once again on the temple master. He sits, slumped against the wall. Unlike before, he can’t even bring himself to meet my eyes. He whimpers, terror written plainly on his features, and I can’t help but laugh a little, putting a bit of my rage behind.\n\n\n What a funny face.\n\n\n This isn’t the face of a kindly old man, nor the face of an arrogant noble. This is the face of a man who looks at a weak little girl and cowers like he’s seeing a monster. I get a little irritated at how this many-faced temple master can’t seem to stay anything to me, and take a single step forward.\n\n\n “G… get away! Get away from me! Don’t come any closer!”\n\n\n His breathing is ragged as he yells at me, like he’s in great pain. He’s just saying the same thing over and over, like he’s so panicked he can’t even come up with anything else to say.\n\n\n Over my right shoulder, I hear the head priest hurriedly calling out to me.\n\n\n “Please, wait! If you keep letting your emotions control your mana like this, Father B?sewanz’s heart will give out!”\n\n\n “Hmmm?” I say, taking one slow, measured step after another towards the temple master. “I don’t mind if he dies, though. If he lives, then he’s going to have my mother and father killed, isn’t he? So perhaps he should die before he has the chance to do that. If you’re willing to kill someone, aren’t you supposed to be prepared to be killed yourself? Perhaps you should be happy about this! Aren’t you next in line for his position if he dies?”\n\n\n With my fourth step forward, the temple master goes limp, his eyes wide and mouth frothing. In the next instant, the head priest steps in to block my view. He kneels down in front of me. He grits his teeth as if in great pain, a cold sweat dripping down his face, but looks at me with a very serious expression.\n\n\n “Let us talk.”\n\n\n “‘Talk’? You mean with our fists? Ah, or perhaps with our magic?”\n\n\n The head priest’s eyes open wide, and he starts coughing violently. A bit of blood leaks from the corner of his mouth. I am captivated by the sight of the bright red drop.\n\n\n “Don’t kill him,” he says. “If you kill Father B?sewanz, your entire family will be killed by the nobles. I don’t think that is what you want, is it?”\n\n\n His words give me a moment of clarity. I can’t let my desire to protect my parents run so rampant that I get my entire family executed. I blink, rapidly, and a long, exhausted sigh slips through the head priest’s lips.\n\n\n “Have you come to your senses?” he says.\n\n\n “…Probably.”\n\n\n The head priest slumps with relief. He pulls a handkerchief out of his breast pocket, wipes his mouth, and straightens his disheveled bangs. And, with that, he looks as cool and composed as he would have been if nothing had ever happened at all.\n\n\n “Let’s have a conversation,” he says. “Like you want.”\n\n\n “And you’ll actually listen to all of our demands?”\n\n\n He flinches, then lightly shakes his head. He lays a hand on my shoulder.\n\n\n “…If you want that to happen, I need you to get your mana under control. Do you think you can do that?”\n\n\n I take in a slow, deep breath, gathering up all of the heat that had spread throughout my body and compressing it deep down, back into my heart. This is something I do a lot, but I can’t help but feel like there’s more of the devouring fever than I thought there would be.\n\n\n Ah, but it’s not the devouring fever, though. It’s mana?\n\n\n I tell myself that it doesn’t matter either way as I finish tidying up the last of it and sealing it tightly away. In that instant, all of the strength leaves my body, and I collapse like a puppet with its strings cut.\n\n\n “Oop,” says the head priest, reaching out to catch me as I crumple in front of him, saving me from falling to the floor.\n\n\n “Ma?ne!”\n\n\n “Are you okay?!”\n\n\n My parents rush over, and the head priest picks me up, handing me to them. My mother kneels down and takes me, hugging me tightly against her. My father nervously looks down at me, eyes filled with worry as I dangle limply in my mother’s grasp.\n\n\n “I’m okay,” I say. “The devouring fever went wild for a bit so my temperature went up and down very fast, that’s all. It happens all the time. I’m still wide awake.”\n\n\n “It happens all the time?” says my father, uneasy. “That?”\n\n\n I manage a small smile. “It’s rare for my emotions to run wild like that, but half a year ago when it looked like the devouring was going to swallow me up, my fever was going wild quite often.”\n\n\n While I talk to my parents, the head priest stands up and talks to the priests, giving them instructions on how to deal with the present situation. He asks some of them to look after the temple master, and others to go prepare a room for us to have our discussion in.\n\n\n “You two, get Father B?sewanz into his bed, then go to your rooms and rest as well. Taking that much magical coercion head-on must have left you exhausted.”\n\n\n “But Father Ferdinand, what about you…?”\n\n\n As the worried-sounding priest says, the person who should be the most exhausted here isn’t any of the priests that had been off to the side, but the head priest himself. He’d stepped between me and the temple master, putting himself directly in front of me, and met me eye-to-eye as we talked.\n\n\n “Are you… really okay?” I ask without thinking, suddenly remembering the blood leaking from the corner of his mouth.\n\n\n The head priest looks at me, startled, then smiles wryly. “This is my punishment,” he says. “I had no idea just how much mana someone who had managed to survive the devouring up until their baptism might have, yet I sat quietly aside as Father B?sewanz made you so angry. It’s only natural.”\n\n\n Now that he’s finished giving instructions, he walks slowly over to me. Now that he’s closer, I can hear just how ragged his breathing really is. It’s plain to see how hard he’s pushing himself.\n\n\n “Why were you just observing?”\n\n\n “I had been thinking that it would be best for us if we could get you to join the temple without any extra conditions. It would save a lot of trouble for us, and I must confess I was a little greedy over what we would gain from the arrangement. I hadn’t even considered that your parents, commoners, would have ever refused an order from a nobleman, let alone be prepared to face capital punishment in order to protect you.”\n\n\n As the head priest murmurs about how far out of his expectations this was, my father narrows his eyes at him.\n\n\n “Ma?ne is our precious daughter. How many times do I have to tell you this, sir?”\n\n\n The head priest looks down at me. He smiles a complicated smile, with hints of self-recrimination and a thought that he had looked at something terribly radiant. He gently strokes my head as I rest in my mother’s arms.\n\n\n “…Ma?ne, I am quite honestly jealous of how loved you are by your parents. After all, those of us here at the temple, whether we are orphans or noblemen, are people whose parents did not need.”\n\n\n These incredibly sad words, said to me in this dazzlingly extravagant room, will stay in my heart for the entire time I stay at the temple.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n With the temple master put to bed, we relocate to the head priest’s room so that we can have our conversation. The basic arrangement of the room and the quality of the furniture is the same as the temple master’s, but there’s no display shelf here. In its place is what appears to be a work desk, covered with wooden boards and pieces of parchment. It seems like the head priest is responsible for singlehandedly managing the practical business of the temple.\n\n\n This time, we’re properly asked to take a seat at the table. Since I still can’t move my body at all, I am propped up on a sofa. Then, we begin our discussion.\n\n\n “On a previous note,” says my father, “you mentioned 'coercion’, right? May I ask what that might be? Ma?ne’s eyes were glowing with a rainbow light, and yellow mist was rising off of her…”\n\n\n What the hell?! I had no idea that such bizarre phenomena was happening! Rainbow eyes and weird mist, what the hell?!\n\n\n My eyes almost pop out of their sockets when I hear him say that. I’m the only one who didn’t know about it (or, rather, hadn’t seen it), so my silent astonishment goes largely unnoticed and the conversation quickly continues.\n\n\n “It’s a phenomenon that occurs when one’s emotions run rampant. Mana is circulated through the body and activated, and a coercive effect is applied to anyone that one considers to be an enemy. It’s something that happens frequently in children who have a hard time controlling their emotions; surely you’ve seen it at least once?”\n\n\n My parents look at each other, trying to remember.\n\n\n “I’ve seen her eyes change colors a few times,” says my mother. “Usually when she’s acting spoiled. It was never something that I’d describe as 'coercion’, though. She usually settled down when I told her she was being unreasonable.”\n\n\n “Come to think of it,” says my father, “there was one time when she’d gone to the forest to make something, then Fey and the others destroyed it. I think that was the first time I saw it. It was a little intimidating.”\n\n\n My parents are having a lively conversation as they start remembering things, but I, the third party to this conversation, am only growing more and more intensely aware of my own strangeness. I’m pretty sure a little girl whose eyes change colors and starts to give off an intimidating vibe whenever she started being unreasonable would be described as, quite frankly, creepy.\n\n\n It wouldn’t have been strange for them to get rid of me. Man, they’ve taken great care to try to raise me right…\n\n\n “The amount of influence depends on the amount of mana used,” says the head priest, “so it’s likely that the difference in power compared to those previous incidents is caused by Ma?ne having gradually gained more and more mana. Please, take care not to cause her to run wild like that in the future.”\n\n\n “If nothing extraordinary happens,” I say, “I won’t lose control of my emotions.”\n\n\n When I indirectly point blame at the temple master for causing me to lose control, the head priest stares at me for a moment, narrowing his eyes.\n\n\n “I’d heard that having the devouring generally means that someone has a comparatively large amount of mana, but I hadn’t thought that you’d be able to release so much that your coercion would cause the temple master to faint. …If I may ask, how are you still alive?”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n I don’t know how to answer that one. I tilt my head, not fully understanding the question, and the head priest starts to explain.\n\n\n “You need to have a force of will that is stronger than the mana you are trying to keep bottled up. For a child who doesn’t know that they must keep their emotions in check, the amount of mana that they can endure with their fragile wills is quite frankly not very large. If a child is born with strong magic, they die quickly. Since the amount of mana one possesses multiplies as one grows older, the magical strength of a child who has survived all the way to their baptism is not anything to fear. It is odd that someone with magic as powerful as yours has survived for as long as you have.”\n\n\n “I’m pretty sure I’ve been close to death. A very kind person sold me a broken magical tool, once, which allowed me to live a little longer.”\n\n\n The original Ma?ne died two years ago. Then, if Freida hadn’t saved me, I would probably have died half a year ago. Like the head priest says, making it all the way to my baptism while having the devouring was no easy task.\n\n\n “I see. But did you not wish to have this kind person help you find a noble with which to make a contract? Without a contract you wouldn’t be able to continue living. Granted, it is only because you did not make such a contract that you were able to meet us like this, but I can’t help but wonder why you would have made this choice.”\n\n\n He really does look curious. I tilt my head to the side as well.\n\n\n “If making a contract with a noble means I’ll be locked away, there’s not much point to living anymore, is there? I wanted to stay with my family. I wanted to make books. I wanted to live for my own sake, because otherwise it would be meaningless.”\n\n\n “…Living for your own sake… I simply can’t understand thinking like that.”\n\n\n He shakes his head, takes a slow breath to steady himself, then looks at me, my mother, and my father in turn before opening his mouth to speak.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, I wish for you to join the temple. This is not an order, but a request.”\n\n\n “I heard from a merchant that the number of nobles here in the temple has been decreasing, so you don’t have enough mana, correct? Is it really true that you use magic to help the crops grow?”\n\n\n “…What a well-informed merchant. Well, alright then.”\n\n\n It seems that somehow Benno managed to acquire accurate information. If that’s the case, then the lack of mana really will have terrible, far-reaching effects.\n\n\n “Can you not cooperate with the other nobility?” I ask.\n\n\n “There are various other magical tools that must be kept running in order to protect the city. The fundamental basis of our city’s defenses are its magical tools, after all.”\n\n\n I’d been wondering why the other nobles weren’t bothering to help, but it seems like they’ve got other things that they need to do.\n\n\n “The temple master being who he is,” says the head priest, “the majority of the practical business of running the temple falls to me. It is very unusual for a child with the devouring to have as much mana as you do. As promised, I’ll accommodate you as best as I can.”\n\n\n “Dad, I’ll leave it to you.”\n\n\n He’s taking our conditions seriously. Now it’s time for my father, the head of the house, to take over. My mother gently strokes my head. “You look so tired. You should rest now,” she says, but I must make sure I stay awake to listen. This conversation is all about my future; if I don’t pay proper attention, Benno’s going to smack me on the head again. As I continue to recline on the couch, I watch my father’s discussion with the head priest closely.\n\n\n “Then, sir, here are our conditions,” says my father. “If what you need most from Ma?ne is her mana, then we would like for her to be treated more like a noble priest. She absolutely cannot be put to the same work as the gray-robed priests.”\n\n\n The head priests nods, not having to give it much thought.\n\n\n “I’ll have a special blue outfit prepared for her. She’ll have the same duties as the younger nobles, which largely consist of tending to the magical tools here. This is what I was originally intending to suggest, had the temple master not gone so wild, so I have no objections. How would it sound if I were to have her both tend to the magical tools and, as she has requested, work in the library as well?”\n\n\n My opinion of the head priest, who is offering me permission to enter the library with no strings attached, is skyrocketing.\n\n\n He may have a cool demeanor, but he risked his own well-being to stop me, he’s skilled enough to singlehandedly manage the temple’s affairs, he read the scriptures to me, he’s letting me into the library, he’s letting me into the library, he’s letting me into the library!\n\n\n “Father Ferdinand, you’re such a good person!”\n\n\n “Uh?”\n\n\n It seems my deeply heartfelt joy did not reach him. He and my father give me a single, fleeting glance, and then simply return to their conversation.\n\n\n “Next, if our daughter were to be kept here at the temple out of our sight, we would be constantly worried sick. We would like for her to be able to come home. We don’t have any intention of giving her up.”\n\n\n “…Hmm, I see. Since Ma?ne is not an orphan, she should be able to go home. Practically, many of the nobility here have homes to go back to as well, so this shouldn’t pose any problems.”\n\n\n “Pardon me,” says my mother, “but Ma?ne is very frail, so she won’t be able to perform her duties every day. Is there something you can do about this?”\n\n\n My mother lightly covers my mouth with one hand, prohibiting me from speaking, as she moves the conversation forward.\n\n\n “There’s no need for her to push herself when she’s not feeling up to it. You implied that she’s able to go to the forest when she’s well enough; she’s not incapable of moving, is she?”\n\n\n Frustrated at myself for having spoken out of turn before, I shake my head, making eye contact with the head priest.\n\n\n “Even if I’m feeling okay, it’s pointless if I don’t have Lutz with me.”\n\n\n “Lutz? The boy who came to pick you up the other day?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir. He’s always been helping me manage my health. If he’s not with me, I often collapse suddenly and my fever comes back. I need to have someone to help me with managing my condition.”\n\n\n Before I can continue onto my next thought, which would have been that I’ll only be able to come at Lutz’s convenience on days when my health is good, the head priest nods. Without saying anything, he jots something down on a nearby board.\n\n\n “Ahh, so you’ll be needing attendants? I have no objections there. Blue-robed priests and priestesses generally have several assigned to them.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n Did he just say “attendants”? Having several people assigned to me would actually be really hard on me, though?\n\n\n As I sit there in mute bewilderment, the head priest looks away from me, glancing at my parents.\n\n\n “Do you have any objections so far? Any further conditions?”\n\n\n He’s absolutely fine making whatever compromise he needs to. It seems like Benno was right: these people will do anything to make sure that I join the temple.\n\n\n “Um,” I say, “Father Ferdinand. I’m currently registered with the merchants’ guild. Will I be able to continue operating my workshop?”\n\n\n “…The temple master must have told you that you’ll have no use for that while in service of the gods.”\n\n\n This is the first thing he’s disapproved of. He frowns intensely, deep in thought. Just as Benno taught me, I start to negotiate.\n\n\n “…However, I’ve been operating this workshop forever. It’s my main source of income. You run an orphanage here, don’t you? If I hired the orphan children to work for a wage, and set aside some of the profits from my products to donate to the church, could we possibly work something out?”\n\n\n Unlike the temple master, who I’m sure would have rejected me without a second thought, the head priest is in charge of the day-to-day affairs of the temple. This, of course, must include their accounting. As Benno said, with fewer nobles, there are fewer donations coming in, so the temple must be in need of money. As I watch him, waiting patiently for his answer, he sighs, rubbing his temples. “Just how much do you know?” he mutters, sadly.\n\n\n “…Very well. We’ll have a more detailed discussion in the future about the percentage of your profits that you’ll be setting aside, then put that in writing. As of now, I don’t have enough information to be able to talk about this.”\n\n\n “I understand. Let’s leave talking about donations and money until a later date.”\n\n\n I don’t really want to have the conversation about donations in front of my parents. The head priest, perhaps noticing this, quirks one eyebrow, but says nothing, instead looking back at my parents again.\n\n\n “Any other conditions?”\n\n\n “No, sir. If she’s given blue robes, is allowed to live at home, and can keep an eye on her health, then as her parents we have no objections. Thank you for your consideration.”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n When we finished our discussion, the head priest invites us to lunch. However, the three of us leave immediately, with my mother saying that it would be best for us to let the head priest get some rest. As we pass through the towering gates of the temple, I see the refreshingly clear, blue skies spreading out before me, and I’m struck with a renewed sense of liberation. I’ve solved all of the problems that have been plaguing me.\n\n\n We head home, my father carrying me in his arms. We walk in silence for a while, but when the central plaza comes into view, signaling that we’ve returned to our usual sphere of existence, my father murmurs, “We did it, huh…”\n\n\n “Yeah,” I reply.\n\n\n “We just won, didn’t we?” he says, expressionlessly.\n\n\n I give him my biggest smile, nodding vigorously. “Yeah! A really big win. Mom, Dad, thank you for protecting me.”\n\n\n I finally have recovered a bit of my strength, so I make a loose fist and bend my elbow. My father, breaking into his usual smile, holds me in one arm, and makes a fist with his other.\n\n\n “Nah, you were the one protecting us, weren’t you? With that 'coercion’ thing.”\n\n\n “Nuh-uh, that just me getting so mad that my fever went wild. I don’t really remember it that well.”\n\n\n Chuckling to each other, my father and I tap our fists together. We managed to get every single one of our demands met, though the financial conversation will come later. I’ll have to talk to Benno about that and come up with a really solid plan so that I can definitely win next time, too.\n\n\n “I’m a little relieved myself,” says my mother. “Since that head priest is there, I’m sure things will turn out alright.”\n\n\n I tilt my head curiously. Certainly, the head priest seems like a very capable person, but I don’t know why looking at him would set my mother’s mind at ease.\n\n\n “He stopped you, didn’t he? You always just take off running in whatever direction you please, so not having anyone to stop you would be terrible. Even if something happens that makes your mana go wild, you’ll have someone there to hold you down and scold you. That’s a very important thing.”\n\n\n That’s exactly the kind of reason I would expect my mother to give. I can easily imagine my days at the temple being full of the head priest scolding me with my mother’s full approval.\n\n\n “…He’s going to get mad at me a lot.”\n\n\n Both of my parents laugh at my prediction.\n\n\n I think about how if I hadn’t been able to stop the temple master, I wouldn’t be looking at this scene right now. I let out a sigh, relieved that I’m actually able to return home with my family.\n\n\n I’m so glad. I went a little wild, but I didn’t mess up.\n\n\n We turn off of the main road and head along the narrow alleyway that leads to our building. When the plaza comes into view, I see Tuuli, pacing nervously by the water well, obviously waiting for us to come home.\n\n\n “Tuuli!” I call out, beaming broadly.\n\n\n “Ma?ne! You’re okay! You really came home!”\n\n\n When she sees me, she immediately starts running towards us, trampling the weeds in her path. My father sets me down, leaving a hand at my back to keep me propped up. Tuuli leaps at me, hugging me tightly.\n\n\n “I’m so glad you’re back, Ma?ne! I was waiting forever!”\n\n\n Tuuli is so happy that tears are welling in her eyes. I smile back at her.\n\n\n “I’m glad to be back too.”"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n My name is Tuuli! I’m eight years old.\n\n\n When my little sister Ma?ne said she got everything figured out at the temple about becoming a sister-in-training, I was super relieved. She’s not going to die because of the devouring, and she’s not going to be a gray-robed priestess and get treated like an orphan. I was really scared that she’d go away and I’d never see her again, but that’s not going to happen, and I’m super happy about that!\n\n\n The day after Mom and Dad got called out to the temple, Ma?ne headed out to go to Mister Benno’s shop. She said that she needed to ask him some things about how she should be dealing with the head priest, and that while she was there she was going to figure out what day she was going to meet with Miss Corinna. Last time she met with her, she went all by herself, and I was stuck at home. This time, though, Ma?ne said that she’d ask Miss Corinna if I could come too.\n\n\n Aaahh, I’m really looking forward to this! My Ma?ne is such a good girl, always thinking of her big sister! I’m gonna get to brag to all my friends at the workshop about how I got to go to Miss Corinna’s house.\n\n\n Miss Corinna’s really amazing! When she came of age, she got her own workshop, and then she started getting orders from the nobility to make clothes for them. To apprentice seamstresses like me, she’s like a shining star in the sky, someone that one day we want to be just like.\n\n\n The story of how her amazing husband proposed to her super dramatically is like a legend you’d hear from a minstrel. All the apprentice seamstresses talk about it. For the sake of his love, he cast aside his dreams of being a merchant, spent all of the money he’d saved up, and then proposed to her! Hearing rumors like that, it’s really obvious to see that he really loves her a lot. It’s the kind of story that every girl wants to be part of.\n\n\n I wonder what kind of person Miss Corinna is? All I know is that Ma?ne said that she was really nice, and also really pretty.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The front door opens, and Ma?ne comes leaping in. “I’m home, Tuuli!” she says, beaming. “Miss Corinna said that she definitely wants to see you and Mom too. Tomorrow afternoon, she said.”\n\n\n From how hard she’s panting, it looks like she was kinda hurrying home. Immediately after she tells me about this, she collapses on the spot.\n\n\n “Ma?ne?!” I say.\n\n\n “Urgh… I really wanted to come home and tell you as quick as I could, maybe I over did it? Sorry.”\n\n\n “It’ll be a big problem if you can’t actually make it out there tomorrow. Come sit down and take a break.”\n\n\n Ma?ne flops limply into a chair, and her glossy, dark blue hair falls down behind her. She’s always trying her best at a lot of different things, so she’s gotten a little bit healthier, but she’s definitely still not actually strong, and she’s still not getting any bigger. She still looks like she’s four years old, and I really can’t help but worry about her.\n\n\n When she stands next to Lutz, who’s the same age as her, she looks like his little sister, and lately when she goes to the forest, kids two years younger than her offer to help her out, which always makes her slump over dejectedly. She’s not weak just because she has the devouring. Even when she got cured, she was still really frail. She said that Freida, who has the same disease, doesn’t have that problem.\n\n\n Ma?ne rubs at her temples. “…Hmm, am I doing better now?” she says.\n\n\n She stands up, then starts slowly moving around. She carefully folds up her nice dress and puts it in the bag that she made herself and really likes, making sure that it doesn’t get dirty, then puts her hairpin in as well. As soon as I realize that she’s getting her things ready for tomorrow, I ask her a question.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, what about me? Do I need to do anything to get ready?”\n\n\n “No, I can’t think of anything… but since it’s such a special occasion, maybe we should wash our hair with rinsham?”\n\n\n “Yeah!”\n\n\n Ma?ne and I start washing our hair with the rinsham I made. I didn’t used to wash it this much, but lately I guess I’ve started thinking that I need to keep myself looking nice. Even at a workshop, the only people who can talk to customers and show them around are people who make sure they’re dressed very neatly.\n\n\n “Hey, Ma?ne,” I say. “Today, they let me sit at the front desk for the first time!”\n\n\n “Wow, really? That’s great, Tuuli!”\n\n\n “It’s all thanks to you,” I say.\n\n\n A while back, when I was grumbling to Ma?ne about how only pretty people got to meet with the customers at work, she said to me, “It’s because first impressions are vital when dealing with customers. It is absolutely something that merchants pay attention to. If you want to go from someone who only works in the back room making things to someone who gets to work publicly with customers, then you have to make sure to keep yourself clean, pay attention to your manners, and so on.” It was cautionary advice about a merchant’s viewpoint.\n\n\n She also said that I should make sure that my work clothes are nice enough that customers can see me in, and in order to make sure that they don’t get dirty I should wear an apron that even covers my sleeves. That way, if I have to talk to a customer, then I can take off the apron, and be wearing clean clothes. I took her advice to heart, and now I’m in a place where I can do work that involves talking to customers, too.\n\n\n “I’m home,” says Mom, as she comes through the front door.\n\n\n She arrives as Ma?ne and I are in the middle of talking about what we’ve gotten done today as we carefully wash our hair. When she sees us drying our hair and thoroughly combing it out, her eyes widen slightly.\n\n\n “Oh my, you’re using rinsham? …Does that mean…?”\n\n\n “Yep!” says Ma?ne. “Tomorrow, we get to go to Miss Corinna’s house.”\n\n\n Mom, when she hears this, immediately tells me and Ma?ne that we’re on dinner duty today and starts washing her hair. Since we definitely understand that she wants to make herself as pretty as possible before meeting with Miss Corinna, Ma?ne and I just shrug at each other and give up our seats.\n\n\n “I’m going to wear the new summer dress you just finished making for me tomorrow,” I say to Mom.\n\n\n “Good idea. That’ll keep you cool, and you look good in it, too.”\n\n\n The cloth that we didn’t need to use to make Ma?ne’s dress has turned into a new summer dress for me, instead. Unlike Ma?ne, I’m actually growing healthily, so I’m always getting too big for my clothes really quickly.\n\n\n There wasn’t enough cloth to make the entire dress, so the skirt part was actually sewn together patchwork-style out of a few different colors of cloth in order to be long enough. It wound up looking like it’s decorative, so it looks really cute. It’s my favorite dress.\n\n\n I wonder if Miss Corinna is going to think it looks cute, too?\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, the three of us leave the house fairly early, making sure that we’ll be able to get there in time even going at Ma?ne’s walking speed. As we pass through the central plaza and enter the north side of town, the clothes of the people around us start to get more colorful, and I start seeing people who are wearing clothes with lots of cloth. Since it’s rare for me to come to the north part of town, I look down self-consciously at my own clothes, wondering if I’m sticking out too much. When I look up at Mom, I see that she looks a little worried about how other people are looking at her too. Ma?ne, however, doesn’t look the least bit worried. In fact, she seems really energetic! She’s still really slow, though.\n\n\n “Miss Corinna’s house is right above Mister Benno’s shop,” she says.\n\n\n When she says that, it starts to make sense. Mom and I have only heard Ma?ne talk about these things. We haven’t seen them ourselves. Ma?ne, though, comes this way with Lutz a lot. There’s no way she’d be worried.\n\n\n “Oh no, how should I introduce myself?” says Mom.\n\n\n “You could start with ‘it’s nice to meet you’, right?” says Ma?ne. “Then maybe something like 'thank you for inviting us here’? And then when you meet Mister Benno and Mister Mark, you could say 'thank you for looking after my daughter’, I think.”\n\n\n Ma?ne immediately has an answer ready for our very stressed-out Mom. We don’t usually need to formally introduce ourselves, but maybe when working at the gates or at a shop, this is the kind of thing you need to be able to bring out immediately, I wonder? She didn’t hesitate at all.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, how about me? How do I introduce yourself?”\n\n\n “Just put on your cutest smile!” she says, beaming. “I can’t think of anyone who wouldn’t be happy if you smile and say how much you’ve been looking forward to meeting them.”\n\n\n Mom and I start practicing our introductions as we walk. Ma?ne watches us, looking amused. Since she’s wearing her apprentice’s clothes, she really blends in here, unlike me and Mom. I suddenly feel like there’s a side of her that we don’t know about. It’s a strange, uncomfortable, almost frustrating sort of feeling.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Miss Corinna, hello~!”\n\n\n Ma?ne is completely unperturbed as she knocks on the door. Mom and I, on the other hand, are not. With every floor we passed as we climbed the stairs, Mom started shivering more and more, and I couldn’t stop my legs from wobbling with every step.\n\n\n Wait a bit, Ma?ne! I’m still not ready!\n\n\n Before I have a chance to settle my nerves, the door opens. “Ma?ne, hello, come in!” says Corinna. She looks up at us. “You must be Ma?ne’s mother and sister. Welcome! I’m Corinna. Please, come in.”\n\n\n The door has opened to reveal a beautiful, charming woman. She is way younger and prettier than I even imagined. Her glossy, pale, cream-colored hair shines like moonlight, and her thin, gentle eyes are a gray that gleams like silver as she looks at us with the kindest expression. Even though her colors are make her look almost ephemeral, she also has a really good figure. The parts of her that are supposed to stick out stick way out, and her waist is very narrow. Her body is the womanly ideal.\n\n\n “Miss Corinna, it’s nice to meet you,” says Mom. “My name is Eva; I’m Ma?ne’s mother. Thank you very much for inviting us here today.”\n\n\n Mom delivers her rehearsed introduction, slightly bending her knees and lowering her chest in a small curtsey. I copy what she did, and introduce myself too.\n\n\n “It’s nice to meet you, Miss Corinna! My name’s Tuuli. I’ve been really looking forward to coming here. I’m happy I get to meet you!”\n\n\n “I’ve been looking forward to meeting you as well. When I saw Ma?ne’s dress, even from far away, it stood out a lot to me. I thought I definitely had to see it up close. Sorry if I’m being a little selfish, calling you all the way out here.”\n\n\n Corinna’s gentle smile is infectious, and I can’t stop myself from smiling too. Her smile is as warm as a clear spring day.\n\n\n “Please, wait here for a moment. I’ll go get some tea ready.”\n\n\n The room that Miss Corinna brings us to looks like it’s a room that she uses for work, filled with embroidered cloth and samples of the clothing that she’s made. There’s so many decorations, this is a really wonderful-looking room. There’s a couple of tables in the room; one in the middle, that looks like it’s for talking, and one off to the side that looks like it’s for working. The table we’ve got in our kitchen that we use for literally everything doesn’t even come close.\n\n\n Aaaaaa!! This is so amazing~!\n\n\n Both Mom and me can’t keep our eyes off of all of the clothing set up around the room and the colorful tapestries hung up on the walls. I never thought that I’d ever see something this beautiful. I slowly spin around, taking it all in, one thing at a time. Every single thing is sewn neatly, colored brilliantly, richly decorated, and sewn into designs that are completely different from anything I’ve ever worn. I sigh in complete wonder, looking at these decorations.\n\n\n “So pretty…” I murmur. “how in the world do I learn how to make things like this? I’d never think to make any of these designs. Is it really just practice?”\n\n\n “Skill is very important, yeah,” says Ma?ne. “but if you want to come up ideas like those, looking at lots of good examples is just as important, too.”\n\n\n I wasn’t expecting her to say anything, so I turn to look at her. She seems tired, sitting all alone in her chair, legs lazily dangling as she looks at me with her golden eyes.\n\n\n “What do you mean?”\n\n\n “If you’re not paying attention to what rich people are wearing, what kind of fads and trends there are, and so on, then you won’t have any ideas like this. Miss Corinna was born into money, so she’s naturally surrounded by good examples. That’s why she knows about what’s good to make.”\n\n\n “So, then, it’s impossible for me?”\n\n\n I slump my shoulders, having been told that I can never get there no matter how hard I try. Ma?ne, though, shakes her head, saying “no, that’s not it.”\n\n\n “I know that going to the forest on your days off is still really important, but whenever you can, you should head past the central plaza and take a walk in the northern parts of town. There’s lots of rich people walking around there, and there’s lots of shops where those kinds of people shop, you know? Lots of different kinds of clothes on display. If you compare them, then you can figure out what kinds of colors and designs are fashionable right now, and use those as reference, I think.”\n\n\n On my days off, I’ve been going to the forest, but have never gone to the north part of town. I actually think I can count the number of times I’ve gone north past the central plaza on one hand. I hadn’t realized that going someplace where rich people are would be a good source of information about the kinds of things rich people liked to wear.\n\n\n “And then, the patterns on these tapestries and the flowers on this embroidery… this is all stuff you can find in the forest, you know? If you take a good look around you at things like that, when you have to come up with a design I’m sure you’ll think of something useful.”\n\n\n “…Okay. I’ll try that!”\n\n\n It looks like Ma?ne looks at this clothing and these decorations completely differently compared to me. I wonder if the difference between me, who was swept away by how pretty everything is, and her is the difference between a craftswoman and a merchant? I try to keep my feelings in check as I stare intently at Miss Corinna’s work, focusing on trying to find some sort of new technique that I can borrow, even how I am now.\n\n\n “Oh my, Tuuli,” says Miss Corinna, entering the room with a servant woman in tow. “I’m a little embarrassed that you’re looking so closely.”\n\n\n “I never see clothes like this anywhere, so I don’t get any chance to look at them like this. I’m an apprentice seamstress, but they still don’t let me work on big things like clothing yet…”\n\n\n Lately, I’ve finally started to be given work to do on small accessories and stitchery in places that won’t be noticed, but I’m still a long ways away from being able to make clothes all by myself.\n\n\n “Practicing the basics is very important! You need to be able to make a nice, straight stitch if you want to make beautiful clothing.”\n\n\n “I’ll try my hardest! Um, Miss Corinna? How did you sew this part here?”\n\n\n “Oh, this? Well…”\n\n\n As the servant woman sets up some tea and sweets on the table, Miss Corinna explains a few things about the various pieces of clothing around the room. At some point, Mom joins in, listening along with me. Ma?ne is the only one left out, looking uninterested as she sits at the table.\n\n\n “Please, eat!”\n\n\n “Thank you very much.”\n\n\n At Miss Corinna’s urging, I take a sip of tea. It’s amazing, completely unlike the tea we drink at home. It feels like the flavor’s spreading out all through my mouth.\n\n\n “This is really good!”\n\n\n “I’m glad that you like it,” says Miss Corinna, smiling sweetly.\n\n\n I glance at my family to see if they agree. Mom’s making a face that looks like she thinks it’s good, but can’t stop thinking about how much it costs, and Ma?ne has her eyes closed, entranced by the flavor.\n\n\n “Please, have some of this too.”\n\n\n Miss Corinna pushes a plate towards me, on which is a pastry made of a thin, bread-like dough topped with fruit and honey. I pick up a slice of it, then take a bite.\n\n\n Hmmm, it’s good, but compared to this I like the recipes that Ma?ne’s been teaching me even better.\n\n\n A little while ago, Ma?ne went to Frieda’s house to teach her a recipe, and came back with a bag of sugar in exchange. Then she started teaching me how to make all sorts of sweets I’d never even heard of, like “crepes”, “compote”, and “pseudo-cookies”. She even says that when it gets colder out she wants to make something called “pudding”, but it seems like it needs to be cooled so it won’t work during the summer. She also put some fruit, some sugar, and some alcohol in a pot and sealed it up. She says that she’s making something that’ll be full of summer flavor by the time winter comes around. I can’t wait!\n\n\n “This is delicious, and so sweet,” says Ma?ne, taking another bite. “I’m so envious that you can use so much honey on these…”\n\n\n Corinna smiles wryly. “If that’s how you feel, why don’t you buy some yourself? You’ve certainly made Benno bitter enough to afford it.”\n\n\n “I’m keeping my workshop’s funds separate from my own personal spending money.”\n\n\n After we finish eating, we immediately take out Ma?ne’s dress. Mom and Ma?ne show it to Miss Corinna, and they explain all the alterations that we made. Miss Corinna picks it up and looks over it carefully, inspecting the backs of the seams and rolling up the hems.\n\n\n “I never would have guessed this was an alteration,” she says.\n\n\n “It would have been much easier to make something from scratch,” agrees Ma?ne.\n\n\n As Ma?ne explains, Miss Corinna writes something on a little wooden board. She looks just like Ma?ne does when she’s writing on her slate or on her paper. I start to wonder if maybe I should learn how to read and write, too. Being able to write like that is actually kinda cool, I think.\n\n\n “And this is the hairpin, hm…” murmurs Miss Corinna, picking up the hairpin. The strands of small white flowers sway as she turns it over in her hands. “This is the first time I’ve seen anything like it.”\n\n\n “I made the big white one here,” I say, proudly.\n\n\n “Oh! It’s very beautiful, Tuuli,” she replies.\n\n\n Being praised by Miss Corinna makes my heart melt.\n\n\n She traces a pale fingertip along the flower. “This hairpin is really beautiful. …I think I might want to make ones like these at my workshop; would that be alright?”\n\n\n She smiles, gently tilting her head. This is the most amazingly astounding thing that could possibly happen. I hadn’t even dreamed that Miss Corinna would like the hairpin so much that she’d want to make something like it herself! Overjoyed, I open my mouth, ready to say “Of course!!”, but before the words leave my mouth Ma?ne shakes her head.\n\n\n “There are terms,” she says.\n\n\n I choke. “M… Ma… Ma?ne?!”\n\n\n I absolutely can not believe that Ma?ne, after having finally been called all the way out to Miss Corinna’s house, would make demands! My eyes nearly pop out of my head. Ma?ne looks at me, raising her hand to calm me down.\n\n\n “These hairpins are our winter’s handiwork, one of our most important sources of income. We can’t just give away permission to anyone we want. No matter how much they say they want to make it, if they don’t buy the rights to do so, then that only hurts us.”\n\n\n Ma?ne’s words are like cold water thrown in my face. It’s true, these hairpins are a very, very good source of income for us. I suddenly remember just how much money we’d made last winter, and lose interest in stopping her.\n\n\n “Alright, then, please talk with my brother about that.”\n\n\n Miss Corinna rings a bell. The servant lady appears, and Miss Corinna tells her to go get her brother. Soon, I hear footsteps coming up the stairs.\n\n\n “Corinna, I got your message, what’s… Ah, you must be Ma?ne’s family? It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Benno, Corinna’s older brother.”\n\n\n So, then, is this the Mister Benno that’s done so much for Ma?ne?\n\n\n His light, curly hair, the color of milk tea, frames his kind looking face and his reddish-brown eyes. The way he smiles so sociably makes him look very much like Miss Corinna, and his easy, friendly introduction leaves me with the impression that he’s a very good person.\n\n\n “I’m Eva, Ma?ne’s mother. Thank you for looking after my daughter.”\n\n\n “I’m Tuuli! Hello.”\n\n\n My mother introduces herself, and I frantically follow suit. Mister Benno smiles broadly, nodding at the two of us in turn, then looks down at Ma?ne, quirking an eyebrow.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, what is it this time?”\n\n\n “A request from Miss Corinna. She wants the rights to make my hairpins. How much are you willing to buy them for?”\n\n\n “Business, then?”\n\n\n “Business, sir.”\n\n\n Benno nods, and his demeanor changes in a single, terrifying instant. As soon as a truly merchant-like expression appears on his face, the gentle air about him disappears entirely. With a thud, he sits down roughly in a chair across from Ma?ne, a fierce glint in his eyes as he stares at her.\n\n\n “This much,” he says, holding up several fingers.\n\n\n Ma?ne scoffs. “I certainly can’t sell it for that little. I’d rather take this to Freida instead.”\n\n\n Even though she is seated directly in front of Benno, who is giving off a terrifyingly menacing air, Ma?ne’s expression doesn’t flicker in the slightest bit as she turns down his offer like it’s the most obvious thing to do. Instead, she looks like she might even be a little gleeful when faced with this competition.\n\n\n “We’ve already decided that the things Ma?ne’s Workshop makes would be sold through Lutz, haven’t we?”\n\n\n “The things Ma?ne’s Workshop makes, correct? That doesn’t include recipes or rights, you know?”\n\n\n “You cheeky little…!”\n\n\n Benno’s exasperated shout causes Mom and I, who are still seated at the same table as these two, to flinch back in shock. Ma?ne, however, just smiles sweetly, tilting her head curiously to the side.\n\n\n “Oh, speaking of which, Mister Benno! How much did you decide you’re selling rinsham for? I had a chat with Freida, and it seems that when it comes to the rights for a completely new product that has no other competition, prices should start at no lower than a large gold coin, shouldn’t they? I think I might have been selling my ideas to you for very reasonable rates! Hee hee hee~…”\n\n\n I’d heard her talk about it before, but this is the first time I’ve seen Ma?ne working as a merchant. I know that hearing about it and seeing it are two entirely different things, but seeing her dealing evenly with such a terrifying adult is leaving me completely dumbfounded.\n\n\n What do I do? My little sister’s scary…\n\n\n At home, she’s always worn out, she gets sick whenever she tries to do any work, and she’s just as useless at helping around the house as she’s always been, so this is the first time I’ve seen her take such an active, prominent role in something. I’m honestly shocked. I know she’d been aiming to become an apprentice merchant at Mister Benno’s shop and gave it up because her health wouldn’t allow it, but I wonder if she’d really wanted to stick with it? This really seems to suit her.\n\n\n “This will take a while,” says Miss Corinna, standing up suddenly. “Please, come this way.”\n\n\n “Huh? …Huh?”\n\n\n Corinna beckons us over to the table on the edge of the room. Mom and I exchange a look, then quietly stand up and follow her. I’m worried about Ma?ne, but even if we stayed with her, it really didn’t feel like there was anything we could do to help her.\n\n\n “My brother looks like he’s enjoying himself very much, so it’ll probably take a while,” she says quietly, looking at the other table. “…That said, I’m really impressed by Ma?ne, how she’s able to negotiate with my brother like that.”\n\n\n This is the first time I’ve ever realized how amazing Ma?ne can be. I’m her older sister, but I didn’t know anything about this until just now.\n\n\n “How about we leave the merchants’ talk to those two, and have our own discussion about sewing? Remind me, we’d been talking about how I shaped this skirt to drape like it does, right?”\n\n\n “Oh, yes! Please.”\n\n\n While the other table works their way through their haggling, a lively conversation about sewing grows at our table as we sip our tea. Miss Corinna kindly explains to us a lot about the kinds of styles and decorations that are currently in fashion with the nobility. It seems like there are a lot of different methods for sewing things, because she’s mentioning names of things that, even when I hear them clearly, don’t bring to mind anything that would help change the shape of a skirt. These are words that I would never hear at the workshop, no matter how much I talked with coworkers, and Miss Corinna is mentioning them one right after the others.\n\n\n “What’s that there?”\n\n\n Whenever I have a question, Miss Corinna kindly answers it for me. I’m happy, but I’m also feeling a little ashamed. I’ve been working as an apprentice for a whole year now. I didn’t think that I had so much left to learn. I’m fully realizing that just asking questions isn’t going to be enough. If I don’t put a lot of effort into practice and study, I’m never going to get to make any clothes for the customers.\n\n\n “This is a kind of dress that is only just starting to come into fashion,” she says, gesturing at a dress that’s shown promptly in the center of a display.\n\n\n It looks like the kind of dress that a noblewoman would wear to a fancy tea party. The cloth is glossy, the thread is fine, and the embroidery added here and there is simply splendid, and I can’t help but sigh in admiration.\n\n\n “It’s lovely,” I say. “But, I can’t believe that you’d need a whole dress just for one use. It seems like it’s a huge waste of money to me…”\n\n\n “Ah, you might be right. But think about it this way: when we sleep, when we go out, when we do dirty work… we have different kinds of clothes for different kinds of situations, don’t we? When you have more money, then the situations you need different clothes for get more and more specific.”\n\n\n “Huh…”\n\n\n Suddenly, there’s a loud clatter from the other table, as if someone had stood up very forcefully. When I look over in shock, I see that both Ma?ne and Mister Benno have stood up and are staring right at each other, with only the table providing any separation between them.\n\n\n “You’re not the slightest bit cute anymore, girl.”\n\n\n “It’s all thanks to your training, sir.”\n\n\n “Hmph, maybe I gave you too much advice…”\n\n\n “Ah, but making sure you gather information from several sources so that you can be as accurate as possible is one of the fundamental principles of being a merchant, isn’t it?”\n\n\n The two of them shake hands, exchanging rueful smiles. It somehow feels like there is something dark lurking behind each of them that they’re keeping restrained.\n\n\n Yep, I don’t think I could ever be a merchant, is the only thought that crosses my mind when I look at the two of them.\n\n\n Ma?ne glances restlessly around the room, looking for us. When she spots us, she rushes over.\n\n\n “We made a deal,” she says as she gets closer, “so Mom, please teach Miss Corinna how to make the hairpins.”\n\n\n She grabs a cup of tea, which has grown cold by now, thanking Miss Corinna for bringing it out.\n\n\n “Ahh… my throat got really dry.”\n\n\n “Good work,” says Corinna. “May I ask, how much did you settle on? I’ll be deciding how much I sell them for based on that.”\n\n\n Ma?ne glances nervously at me and Mom, then quickly holds up a few fingers for Miss Corinna to see. Miss Corinna gasps slightly as she looks at Ma?ne’s outstretched fingers. This must be some sort of merchant-specific sign, I think. I can’t help but get a little annoyed, since I have no idea what it actually means.\n\n\n “We’ve decided that you’ll make hairpins at your workshop for one year, and during that time you’ll have a total monopoly on selling them.”\n\n\n “Even still, I’m impressed that you managed to get that much out of my brother.”\n\n\n Corinna really does seem impressed when she looks at Ma?ne. It seems like that finger sign translates to a particular amount of money.\n\n\n “Hey, Ma?ne,” I say. “How much is that?”\n\n\n I’m legitimately curious as to how much the rights to make these hairpins might actually cost. When I ask, though, Ma?ne suddenly looks extremely troubled. She glances at Mom, then at Miss Corinna, then lets out a quiet moan.\n\n\n “You can’t say how much?”\n\n\n “I mean, it’s a perfectly reasonable price…” she says. “It’s not like I can’t say it, but I really don’t want to…”\n\n\n I keep pestering her, despite how pained she’s sounding. Eventually, she gives in, not even bothering to hide how reluctant she’s feeling.\n\n\n “…One large and seven small gold coins,” she mutters.\n\n\n “What?! Did you say gold coins?!”\n\n\n I’d thought that it was going to be expensive, but I’d been thinking that it was going to be a couple big silver coins. I was off by two entire digits, and the shock of it crashes into my brain like a bullet. My jaw drops, and Mom’s eyes nearly bulge out of her skull.\n\n\n “It sounds like a lot of money,” she says, frantically waving her hands, “but it really is a fair price for selling the rights to something. I mean, this was Mister Benno. I really didn’t rip him off! Also, these funds are for Ma?ne’s Workshop, so it’s not like this is my own money!”\n\n\n No matter how desperately she’s chucking out excuse after excuse, I can’t believe at all that Ma?ne could have so calmly been dealing with a pile of money that huge.\n\n\n I mean, these are large gold coins, right? It doesn’t matter that she’s insisting it’s not her own money, but just how much does she have?! Is she secretly really amazing?! Wouldn’t it be way better for her to be in business instead of going to the temple?\n\n\n ***\n\n\n As I sit there, overwhelmed by the realization that not only do I have a long, long way to go with my sewing, but also that my little sister is actually amazing, our visit to Miss Corinna’s house comes to a close."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n My name is Ilse. I’m the house cook for the guildmaster of the merchant’s guild. Hm? Didn’t anyone tell you it was rude to ask a woman how old she it?\n\n\n I set myself on the path to becoming a cook from a very early age. This was the most natural outcome for me, since my parents ran a restaurant when I was growing up. When I was very little, they just had a little food cart, but as I grew I watched them get set up in a small shop right inside the eastern gates. Because of all of the training they gave me, even before I started my apprenticeship I already knew how to cook and had a much better grasp of finances than the other pre-baptized children.\n\n\n After my baptism, I apprenticed at a shop belonging to some acquaintances of my parents, and I quickly started absorbing as many new recipes as I could. Learning made me so happy, so I memorized every recipe I was taught, watched the other cooks around me to steal their recipes, and spent long hours seeing if I could make them even better than they already were.\n\n\n As I bounced around from shop to shop, I got better to the point that people started telling me that maybe I should be working for the nobility. My parents objected, saying that there was a chance I’d never be able to come back home if I did that, but I brushed them off and went to work for a noble house. It’s only natural, right? How could I possibly pass up the opportunity to learn the kinds of recipes that are prepared for the nobility?\n\n\n I was put to work as the lowest of prep cooks, charged with doing the menial ingredient preparation and washing the dishes. There, I quickly started stealing the techniques of the head chef. I learned that the ingredients and seasonings used in the nobility’s food are enormously different compared to what the rest of us eat. Even the plates they eat off of are more extravagant than anything you would see in any restaurant in the city. I spent every day studying every single detail.\n\n\n However, that only lasted a few short years. No matter how hard I pursued my studies, I reached a point where I just couldn’t climb any higher through the ranks. After all, it’s not skill that you need to rise to prominence in a noble house. It’s your lineage and your connections.\n\n\n My grumblings about this reached the ears of the guildmaster of the merchant’s guild. He’d been out looking to a head chef to hire away from their position to work at his house, but when he heard about my skill and the fact that I was at a dead end in my career he offered to hire me. He told me that his granddaughter would be going to the nobles’ quarter when she grew up, and he wanted me to make for her the kinds of food that the nobility eat. He didn’t want her to face any hardships when she eventually left to go live there all by herself, he said.\n\n\n I accepted on the spot. My chance to demonstrate my true skills as head chef had finally come around. On top of that, this was at the home of the guildmaster of the merchants’ guild, who had more money than even some of the lesser nobility! He made sure that the kitchen was furnished with the same equipment you’d find in a nobleman’s kitchen, and arranged for me to have access to the same ingredients and seasonings. This job had me doing exactly what any cook would dream of, in the perfect workspace. And, in order to make full use of this ideal environment, I have spent every day exercising my skill to my utmost. I have never before had a life more enjoyable and fulfilling than this.\n\n\n I had utmost confidence in my skills.\n\n\n I took great pride in all of the recipes I’d gathered throughout my career.\n\n\n Yes. Until Ma?ne came crashing in.\n\n\n That was a shock.\n\n\n Sugar is an ingredient that had only recently been introduced to this region from Central, and, even though this is the guildmaster’s house, had only just become available to me here. There is no way that anyone here could have had time to establish any sort of culinary principles around its use. I’d been thinking up a variety of possible uses for it, but hadn’t yet had enough time to do any proper experimentation with it.\n\n\n Despite this, Ma?ne immediately produced desserts with it as if she’d been using it every day in her life. She lacked the physical strength and stamina to make anything herself, so the actual cooking was done entirely by me, but she gave me instructions in a way that wouldn’t have been possible if she hadn’t known a recipe.\n\n\n The “pound cake” that we baked was a fluffy, moist dessert with a refined taste. The way it seemed to melt in my mouth was unlike any recipe I had ever encountered before. That’s right, even in my time cooking for the nobility.\n\n\n However, the girl who taught the young Miss Freida this recipe is a commoner, the daughter of a soldier and a dyer. She does not live in a situation where she should have easy access to luxury goods like sweets. The only source of sweet things in her diet should be the fruits and berries that she can find in the forest.\n\n\n Where in the world did she learn this recipe?\n\n\n After that day, I started experimenting with the pound cake recipe that she’d taught me. I experimented with how much froth I whipped into the batter, how hot I kept the oven, how long I baked it for, and so on. After countless variations, I created what I thought was the ultimate masterpiece, the finest cake I could make with all of my skill. It was so good that even Miss Freida started wondering if this was something that could be sold to the nobility.\n\n\n She said that she wanted to have Ma?ne sample it, say how delicious it is, and sell us the rights to it. Ma?ne has the devouring, she said, and is looking for connections with the nobility. Miss Freida thought that she could offer to introduce Ma?ne to a noble who would give her favorable conditions in exchange for the rights to the pound cake.\n\n\n However, despite Miss Freida’s scheme, Ma?ne didn’t show her face at all, even as summer grew closer. Miss Freida took drastic measures to bring her here, only to have her refuse the offer with the calm of a girl who didn’t actually realize her life was running out.\n\n\n “Welcome, Ma?ne,“ I said. \"Glad you could make it. I baked some pound cake today, and I’d love to hear what you think of it.”\n\n\n After taking a bite of the pound cake that I had improved again and again, she offered a plan to improve it further in exchange for a bag of sugar.\n\n\n “If you grate ferigine peel and add it to the batter, that’ll change both the smell and the taste, and it’ll still be delicious. You could add other things, too, and those will change the flavor as well. As for what exactly to put in and exactly how much, please do some experimentation on your own. I’ll tell you this as a bonus, too: if you’re going to bring this out to serve to nobles, then you could thoroughly whip heavy cream and make a fringe around the edge of the cake, then decorate it with fruit to make it look really extravagant,” she said.\n\n\n Now, I grip my bowl tightly, beating together batter for a pound cake with ferigine peel mixed in. I have no doubt about it: Ma?ne, who can so immediately spit out ideas for improvements, must know more recipes.\n\n\n I want them. I want those new recipes.\n\n\n I want the recipes that Ma?ne knows.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n \"Ilse, Ilse! I brought Ma?ne!”\n\n\n Miss Freida opens the kitchen door and rushes in with a huge smile on her face. Ever since she’d decided that she was going to be throwing a tasting party, she’s been unusually energetic. She’s roped the entire family into this and is pulling out all of the stops to make this a success.\n\n\n Since she had been very weak ever since she was born, when I first started working here I noticed that she spent the majority of her time in her room. Now, though, it’s difficult to imagine that the Miss Freida in front of me is the same girl who enjoyed spending all day shut in her enormous room, counting money. She’s changed so much, ever since she met Ma?ne. Now, she’s been burning with a desire to become a better merchant than Benno, who has been quickly amassing clout in this town as of late, and lure Ma?ne over to work for her. Miss Freida, of course, is the kind of girl who drags her entire family into whatever she gets excited about.\n\n\n “Now then,” she says to Ma?ne, “these are the things you suggested might appeal to kids. What do you think?”\n\n\n She leads her over to a table in the corner and starts setting out small slices of the cakes that I’ve made. It seems that she’s brought her over today to ask her questions about the tasting party. Ma?ne glances around the table as she answers the question.\n\n\n “Well, commoner kids won’t be able to afford it, but merchant kids would probably be able to tell how much it’s worth, and they’d probably have enough money to actually buy it, right? And if they’re around apprentice age, then they should be able to read… Actually, most importantly, when someone grows up, they never forget the kinds of food that they liked when they were kids.”\n\n\n “Ah, I see…” murmurs Freida, writing something on a wooden board.\n\n\n Freida seems to be taking all this in stride, but this is very strange to me. Ma?ne, thanks to her devouring, has been slow to mature, so it’s difficult to see her as anything but a very young, unbaptized little girl. Despite that, she’s making some very adult comments, isn’t she?\n\n\n “And then also, when you’re selling the pound cake, instead of selling the entire cake, you could maybe just sell slices. You’d be able to sell those for less, and increase the number of actual sales, I think. You’d get people wanting to share a slice with their sweethearts, or maybe give them to their kids to congratulate them for their baptisms, and so on…”\n\n\n “I’ve been planning to start by selling these among the nobility,” replies Freida, “as a high-class dessert.”\n\n\n Miss Freida, who owns monopoly sale rights, wants to price it as high as she possibly can. Ma?ne wants to lower the price a little so that it can be sold to many more people. Even though these two girls are the same age and trying to sell the same thing, they have two entirely different schools of thought about it.\n\n\n “I get that you’re trying to get as much as you can out of your monopoly, but these are sweets. I think it’s a better idea to try to make it really popular so you can get a lot of customers…”\n\n\n “My monopoly lasts for just one year. Why would I want it to be popular after my year is up? I’d prefer to sell it exclusively to the nobility for that year and try to price it as high as I possibly can.”\n\n\n “Hmm. Well, in that case, if you use seasonal fruits, then you’ll be able to offer new flavors each season. Making little differences like that will keep your regular customers happy.”\n\n\n Seasonal flavors, she says? My ears immediately pick up on her offhanded remarks. As different seasonal fruits flash across my mind, I cock my head curiously.\n\n\n “There’s no seasonal fruits in winter, right? What would we use then?”\n\n\n “Paru is a winter fruit, isn’t it? Also, you could use ‘rumtopf’—”\n\n\n Ma?ne’s eyes go wide and she snaps her mouth shut mid-sentence. The silence hangs awkwardly in the air, and I raise my eyebrows at her. She glances nervously around the room, then crosses her fingers together in front of her mouth.\n\n\n “…Any more will cost you.”\n\n\n From the awkward face she’s making, it seems like she’s finally realized that her mind tends to wander off in a conversation and leaves her to thoughtlessly leak valuable information.\n\n\n Freida chuckles. “How much might it cost, then? I’ve already set aside quite a bit of money so that I can make sure to pay you for your knowledge.”\n\n\n Ma?ne, when paid a price she thinks is fair for her information, often throws in extra knowledge on top of that as a freebie. Miss Freida says that, rather than being stingy with our profits and trying to cheat her, giving her an actually fair price and building a solid, friendly relationship of mutual trust is better for us in the long run. It was a little astonishing to hear her say that, since she’d previously been of the belief that the fundamental nature of merchants was that of deceit.\n\n\n “Umm, well, what I’m calling 'rumtopf’ is really just a way to pickle fruit in rum. It takes time for it to get tasty enough for that, but by winter you should have something you can use in a pound cake.”\n\n\n “How does five large silver coins sound for that?”\n\n\n If it’s just pickling fruit in rum, then the rest is just a matter of trial and error. I start thinking of ways I could still make things work if, in the worst case, negotiations fall through completely, but then Ma?ne glances at the bag of sugar.\n\n\n “…Since sugar really isn’t on the market here, then that means that it’ll be hard for anyone else to make or use 'rumtopf’, isn’t it?”\n\n\n Looks like this pickling process uses sugar, too. In that case, it’s probably worth asking her. Sugar-based cuisine is still very much in the experimental stages, and nobody has yet to come up with any real recipes. I exchange a glance with Miss Freida, who subtly nods back at me.\n\n\n “Then perhaps eight small gold coins would suffice?”\n\n\n “Alright. I’ll tell you how to make and use it. I don’t think there’s any need for a contract, since you’ll basically already have a monopoly until sugar really makes it onto the market, right?”\n\n\n After they tap their guild cards to finish their transaction, Ma?ne points out a jar sitting on one of the kitchen shelves.\n\n\n “We’ll need a jar like that. Do you have a spare?”\n\n\n “We can use that one,” I say. “There’s nothing in it right now. What else do we need?”\n\n\n As Ma?ne starts listing off instructions, I start moving around the kitchen to get everything ready. She says we’ll need to take several lutebelles, a seasonal fruit, wash them thoroughly, cut them up into chunks that are roughly equally-sized, and put them in a bowl. Then, we’ll need to fill the bowl halfway with sugar and let it sit. The sugar, she says, will draw out the moisture from the fruit, so I’ll need to leave it until it looks like the sugar is dissolving.\n\n\n “Ma?ne,” I say, “do you know how much sugar costs? Are you sure we really need to be using all of this?”\n\n\n “It’s a preservative,” she says. “If you’re stingy with it, then the fruit will bruise easily and won’t be edible. Also, for the rum, you’re going to want the strongest rum you can find. Otherwise, the fruit will rot.”\n\n\n I have a feeling that this girl, who trades her recipes and rights away for huge sums of gold, might not actually have a good sense for money. If she knew that sugar was literally worth its weight in silver, would she be using it in huge piles like this?\n\n\n “Once all the moisture’s been sucked out of the lutebelles, put it in this jar and then add some rum. …Umm, if any of the fruit isn’t fully covered, then that part’ll get moldy. So then after about ten days, you can add other fruit. I think pyuhl and bralle are in season soon, right? If you put a bunch of summer fruits in there, then you can eat them in winter. Oh! That’s right. This doesn’t work really well with ferigine, I don’t think.”\n\n\n Miss Freida is quickly writing down all of the important points. I commit everything to memory as well as I stir up the contents of the bowl. I can already see a bit of the moisture being sucked out of the fruit.\n\n\n “Have you made this?” I ask.\n\n\n “Yeah. I used the sugar you gave me last time. It’s my first try making it too. So you can use this when making pound cake, or you can maybe use it as a jam substitute too. I also think it would be really tasty in a 'parfait’ or served with 'ice cream’, too…”\n\n\n Ma?ne looks like she’s very much looking forward to making all of these things as she stares, entranced, off into space, a smile on her face as she continues rambling. Miss Freida suddenly startles, looking back at the table.\n\n\n “Oh no! We’re getting distracted. I brought you here to talk about cake tasting, after all.”\n\n\n “Ah, yeah, you’re right. So, about that, I kinda want to invite Mister Benno too. Is that okay?”\n\n\n “Why, might I ask?”\n\n\n A sharp glint enters Miss Freida’s eyes as she looks closely at Ma?ne. Ma?ne scratches her cheek, looking off into space as if she’s trying to recall a conversation she’d had with Benno earlier.\n\n\n “Ummm, well, a tasting like this is rare, isn’t it? He’s interested in seeing what kind of sweets you’re going to be selling, but he’s also interested in just coming to the event itself.”\n\n\n “…I see. Mister Benno, hm.”\n\n\n After a moment of pondering, Miss Freida suddenly looks up, eyes gleaming. It seems like she’s just thought of something. She quickly spins around and starts walking towards the kitchen door.\n\n\n “I have something I must go ask my grandfather. I’ll return shortly. Ilse, please take care of our guest.”\n\n\n Thanks to the fact that Benno, who she one-sidedly considers to be her rival, will be coming to the party, it seems like Miss Freida’s fire has grown even hotter. Leaving Ma?ne behind, she walks briskly out of the room, somehow still as elegant as always.\n\n\n “…She left,” says Ma?ne.\n\n\n “She doesn’t usually act like this,” I remark.\n\n\n “Freida said the same thing about you, actually, back when I told you how you could make your pound cake better.”\n\n\n She snickers, and I sigh. I thought I’d left my days of being unable to contain myself when faced with a new recipe long behind me, but it seems like I haven’t changed at all.\n\n\n “Your new recipes are hard,” I say.\n\n\n “…Urgh. I’m sorry about that.”\n\n\n “Nothing you need to apologize for,” I say, lightly. “I still want to know them. Now, why don’t you try these? I’d like to hear what you think.”\n\n\n I line up a slice of the basic cake that she’d taught me how to make, a slice of a cake that I’d added grated ferigine to to change its aroma, a slice where I’d substituted honey for some of the sugar, and a slice with walnuts. Then, I fill a cup with a tea I’d picked to match the cakes and set it in front of her.\n\n\n “Wow, these all look delicious!” she says, eyes sparkling. Beaming, she starts to taste each cake, cutting neat pieces off of each slice with her fork and slowly lifting them to her mouth. The precision with which she moves her fork and her immaculate posture reminds me of the young noblewomen I’d seen who had had table manners thoroughly drilled into them from a young age. At the very least, her attitude is definitely not one of a common girl who ordinarily never gets to eat sweet things.\n\n\n She takes a long drink of tea, seeming to enjoy that too, then lets out a long, satisfied sigh.\n\n\n “I think my favorite out of all of these was the ferigine cake, probably?”\n\n\n “Why’s that?”\n\n\n “I really liked how the flavor seemed to fill my mouth.” She takes another gulp of tea. “…Hm, these tea leaves might really work in a cake, too,” she mutters, squinting down into her cup.\n\n\n “The leaves?” I say. “Wouldn’t that be hard to eat?”\n\n\n “…Ah!” she says, her hands flying up to cover her mouth. “I’ve said too much.”\n\n\n It seems like this might be yet more valuable information. I snort, then bring out another full bag of sugar, the same size as I’d given her last time. The table rattles as I set it down heavily.\n\n\n “I’ll trade you a bag of sugar for the tip,” I say. “I’m only going to get antsy if we just leave it like that. You said you made some of this 'rumtopf’, so you’re probably running low, aren’t you?”\n\n\n To be perfectly honest, I hadn’t even imagined that you’d put tea leaves in a desert. Deserts are sweet things. Sugar is extremely expensive, so I’d heard that the current thinking in Central is that you need to highlight its sweetness when you use it. I can’t imagine that adding tea leaves into a cake would make anything sweet at all. Also, I don’t actually have enough time to experiment with all of the different kinds of ways to use all of the different kind of leaves to figure out what she’s talking about.\n\n\n She hums, thinking about it for just a little while. “…For a bag of sugar? Eh, sure. You make tasty things for me to eat.” She smiles. “If you grind the leaves into a powder so that you can’t taste them individually, then adding tea into the batter can change the aroma of it.”\n\n\n “You mean, this tea?”\n\n\n I point at the pot that holds the tea leaves I’d served to Ma?ne, and she gives me an emphatic nod. I stare distrustingly at the pot for a while, then go to fire up the oven. I sit down next to Ma?ne as she continues to eat her cake and start grinding up tea leaves. I should try this out immediately, I think. I feel bad for neglecting Ma?ne, my guest, but she gives me a happy smile, saying that she’s really just here to taste things and is content to watch me work.\n\n\n “Say, Ma?ne. Do you mind if I ask you something?”\n\n\n “Sure, what is it?”\n\n\n “You don’t just have good ideas about sweets, do you? I bet you’ve got some ideas for soup, as well.”\n\n\n “Huh?!”\n\n\n Ma?ne freezes, fork in her mouth, and looks up at me with her wide, startled, golden eyes. My hands are currently occupied whipping a bowl full of eggs, so I shrug at her with one shoulder.\n\n\n “It’s something I thought of when I saw what you left behind on your plate back when you stayed with us. You ate everything but the soup, didn’t you? I thought at first you just didn’t like vegetables, but then you ate pretty much everything else I fed you. You’ve got another tasty secret in you, don’t you, Ma?ne?”\n\n\n “…You’re very perceptive, Miss Ilse.”\n\n\n She removes the fork from her mouth and gently sets it down on her plate.\n\n\n “Will you teach me?”\n\n\n “Ummm… the soup is actually something I’m kinda worried about. If my circumstances change a little, I might find myself having to take care of nobility, even if I don’t want to. I’m hoping to keep some secrets to myself so I can have them up my sleeve in case I need them to protect myself.”\n\n\n “Ah, I see.”\n\n\n She looks so exhausted that I decide not to press her any further, so I just shrug. I worked in a noble house, too, so I know what she’s afraid of: the differences in social stature and the constant danger of being cut down. It’s entirely natural for her to want to hold on to a few trump cards, and she really should.\n\n\n “Since you’ve got a temporary monopoly on sweets, though, I’d be happy to consult with you about those.”\n\n\n “Really?!”\n\n\n I grip the bowl under my arms even more tightly. Ma?ne flinches back, startled, then nods quickly.\n\n\n “First off, although I guess this is after you get things going, what’s your plan for when your monopoly on pound cake expires?”\n\n\n “Is Mister Benno going to be getting in our way?”\n\n\n Miss Freida always complains about how Lutz and Mister Benno are constantly monopolizing Ma?ne’s knowledge.\n\n\n Ma?ne tilts her head thoughtfully. “Hmmm, I don’t know. I’m sure he’d be mad if I said this, but I don’t think he can? Honestly, I don’t think anything would change if I told him about my dessert recipes.”\n\n\n “Why’s that?”\n\n\n “Well, Mister Benno’s connections with the nobility are still not very deep, so I don’t think he’d be able to find the ingredients or people with the skills to make them. I don’t think he’s got a path open to him that he could get sugar from, and if he can’t hire people away from the nobility, then he’s not going to find a cook like you, will he? I heard from Freida how the guildmaster hired you.”\n\n\n I’m halfway dumbfounded to hear Ma?ne’s frank analysis of Benno, a man who by all reasonable descriptions is practically her guardian. Ma?ne, in her own way, seems to be thinking about who she should be telling things too. If this is the case, though, then this might be my chance to learn more of her recipes.\n\n\n I glance up at her as I pour flour into my bowl. “How about you just open up your recipes to the public? I’d be happy to listen.”\n\n\n “Yeah, if I didn’t know a cook as good as you I wouldn’t be able to make any of these things just by describing them. I really like how enthusiastic you are about learning, too, so I want to help you out too.”\n\n\n Her words make me so happy that I have to keep a wordless shout of joy from springing from my throat. What she’s saying, in other words, is that she recognizes my skill. She’s not going to be telling her recipes to Benno, the man she owes so much to, but to me.\n\n\n “…But, if I just tell them to you, then I don’t make any money off of it, and there’s all sorts of unfairness in that, so I’m in a kinda difficult situation.”\n\n\n Even if Ma?ne herself doesn’t find profit to be that important, the world doesn’t agree. Also, her recipes might cause all sorts of chaos in the rest of the world. She probably has ideas for other things besides food, too, things that have no precedent at all.\n\n\n As I mix melted butter into the bowl, I decide to just ask her the question that’s been on my mind for so long.\n\n\n “So, Ma?ne. Who are you, really? Where in the world did you learn all these recipes?”\n\n\n “…Ummm… a dream.”\n\n\n Without thinking, I shoot her a threatening glare. She must be trying to make fun of me. “…What was that?” I say.\n\n\n She gives me a troubled sort of smile. “…It’s true. Everything so far has just been me trying to eat things I’ve only ever tasted in a dream.”\n\n\n She sighs heavily, letting her eyes close halfway as she looks nostalgically off into the distance, smiling sadly. Seeing such a mature expression on her face makes me strangely anxious. She closes her eyes, briefly, then looks up at me, putting on the biggest, most childish grin she can. It’s painfully obvious how fake that smile is.\n\n\n “But I really do wanna just spread all my recipes eeeverywhere, so I want really good cooks like you to help me make them!”\n\n\n Sensing that there’s something she deeply doesn’t want to talk about, I go back to stirring my batter, and follow along with where she’s trying to steer the conversation.\n\n\n “You can’t make them yourself?”\n\n\n “I mean, I’m weak, and I’m frail, and I don’t have the tools, and I’m not good enough at cooking, so I definitely can’t actually make any of it myself. But if I have good cooks make them for me, then there’s tons of recipes I want to share with the world. I just can’t do it right now, though.”\n\n\n She waves her tiny hands around, letting her eyebrows droop pitifully. I glance at her thin, pale arms, recalling how she didn’t have the strength to whip eggs or stir flour into a batter. She probably really can’t do much cooking with those arms.\n\n\n “Well, if you ever get a craving for something come see me. I’ll be happy to make anything you want, if you show me how to do it.”\n\n\n My heart trembles with the idea of reproducing the recipes Ma?ne saw in her dreams.\n\n\n Aaah, I’m looking forward to that! Just what in the world could be hidden in there?\n\n\n Keeping one eye on Ma?ne as she keeps eating away at her cake, I pour the batter for my new tea-based pound cake into a pan, then shove it deep into the hot oven."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n My name’s Benno. I’m the owner of the Gilberta Company. I’m twenty-nine, and a bachelor.\n\n\n After a long meeting at the merchants’ guild, attended by every shopkeeper who not only owns a store in the city, but owns a big enough one that they have to pay more than the minimum tax, the old asshole that runs the guild looks around the room at each and every one of us before speaking.\n\n\n “That’s it for today, hm? Well then, I’m holding an exhibition in the large conference room for a new kind of dessert that I’m planning on selling soon. Feel free to stop by if you’ve got the time. I’ve made sure to have some ready for any attendants you’ve brought along as well, of course.”\n\n\n I stand up and start heading towards the conference room. The only people here are the owners of large shops. In other words, this is a room full of people who have the money to buy high-class desserts as well as discerning eyes for quality product. If that old bastard had tried throwing a sampling party at his home or at his shop, I don’t actually know how many of us would have dragged ourselves all the way out there, so he’s hosting it here, right after a meeting, close enough that walking there barely even stretches my legs. I’m almost mad at how well he pulled this off. That old man definitely pays attention.\n\n\n Pound cake. The dessert that Ma?ne basically gave away the secret to. On top of that, this tasting party is something that Ma?ne just offhandedly suggested, which got that sh*tty old man’s granddaughter all fired up.\n\n\n That absolute idiot just won’t stop! She just keeps yanking out product after product after market-destabilizing product! And she doesn’t even realize just how much work I have to put in to prevent everything from falling apart! That thoughtless little…!\n\n\n Because one typically wants to have a monopoly on their shop’s signature merchandise, people have avoided throwing events like this to widely reveal their new products before they make it to market. If they wanted to build interest in a product before it reached shelves, they’d try to impress people by advertising whatever amazing inventor actually made the thing. That way, another shopkeeper couldn’t just immediately copy the new product before it went up for sale.\n\n\n What really grinds my gears is that sugar isn’t really a thing that’s widely circulated around here. Basically the only person who’s managed to get any of the sugar that’s coming out of Central is the guild master. Worse, since sweet things are “in” right now in the capital, the nobles here are clamoring for desserts. And on top of that, it’s pretty obvious that this sampling party isn’t just so that the guild master can show off, but so his granddaughter can do so too. That girl has the same nose for coin as her sh*tty grandfather.\n\n\n “Welcome to the pound cake sampling party. Please, select the kinds of cake that most suit you, then place these tokens in the corresponding box.”\n\n\n When we enter the conference room, a few young boys and girls, wearing cloths over their faces, are lined up, handing three wooden slips to each of the guests as they walk in.\n\n\n “You may vote for your favorite three times if you choose, or you may split your votes across three different varieties of cake.”\n\n\n I palm my stack of tokens as I glance around the room. All of the people already circulating through the room have the same cloths draped over their faces, making it easy to immediately tell who’s staffing the party and who’s a guest. Not many guests have made it here yet, and those that have are still warily looking around the room, so nobody has yet to start reaching for any cake.\n\n\n “So, this is pound cake, huh…”\n\n\n On tables in the center of the room, pieces of cake have been neatly arranged, each table containing a different variety of cake. The cake’s been cut into bite-sized pieces, but there’s more varieties of it than I’d been expecting.\n\n\n “Oh, Mister Benno!”\n\n\n “Master Benno, sir!”\n\n\n The two children waving their hands at me are the ringleader of this fiasco, Ma?ne, and my apprentice, Lutz. Lutz is wearing my shop’s apprentice uniform, but Ma?ne’s wearing the same clothing as the people running the party. I casually wave at the two of them, beckoning them over, then when Ma?ne gets within arm’s reach I chop her on the head.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, what do you think you’re doing here?”\n\n\n “Ow ow ow! I’m just helping out, okay?”\n\n\n As she rubs her head, asking if it wasn’t obvious based on what she’s wearing, I reach out and yank off the cloth covering her face.\n\n\n “Go get changed, now. I don’t want any of the merchants that are about to come strolling in here to learn what you look like. Why do you think I’m trying to keep the existence of the paper-inventing, hairpin-making little girl a secret, hm? Are you trying to bring everything down on my shop? Is this some sort of flashy self-promotion, perhaps?”\n\n\n “Nrgh… I’ll go get changed. Lutz, stay here, okay?”\n\n\n I return her cloth to her, and she quickly heads out of the conference room. Watching her leave, I let out a small sigh. Ma?ne’s unusually clever for a girl her age, and picks up on things very quickly. She knows quite a bit that she ordinarily wouldn’t. Despite that, though, she is terrible at paying attention to her surroundings. This is probably pretty normal for a kid, but it’s really obvious how little she thinks about how much she stands out and how completely unconcerned she is about how dangerous that might be.\n\n\n As much as possible, it’s best that she doesn’t stand out at all. If a kid without any serious backing stands out too much, it doesn’t turn out well for them at all. For example, my father died and I inherited his shop just about when I came of age. Everyone looked down on me for being inexperienced, and all sorts of awful things happened as a result of that. A kid fresh out of her baptismal ceremony would just be meat to them.\n\n\n “You are… quite strict with her, sir.”\n\n\n “Lutz, if you want to protect that girl, remember this: without the backing of a merchant, Ma?ne, who doesn’t even have a noble guardian at the temple yet, is in an extremely precarious position.”\n\n\n When I think of how joining the temple will prolong Ma?ne’s life, as well as how it’ll let her form new relationships with the nobility, it’s clearly the right decision for her. However, even trying to imagine what might happen if she keeps going on like she has for the last couple of years gives me an amazingly piercing headache.\n\n\n “Huh, but, aren’t you her guardian…?”\n\n\n “Technically, I am the responsible party for Ma?ne’s Workshop, which allows me to be treated as something like her patron, but that’s a pretty flimsy connection. If I’d been able to make her my apprentice like I did with you, I’d have more I can do, but it’s already been decided that she’s joining the temple, and my arms don’t yet reach quite that far. Unlike how things are now, even you are going to have a hard time keeping an eye on her. It’s best that she doesn’t do anything to stand out.”\n\n\n “Mm, I see. You’re very right.”\n\n\n “Even if that weren’t the case, that girl thinks in ways that I just don’t understand, and the instant I take my eyes off of her she’s gone and done something strange again. So, I think a little strictness is probably in order.”\n\n\n “Aah… that makes quite a bit of sense.”\n\n\n Lutz nods calmly, exactly like Mark does, and I suppress a chuckle. After he was baptized and started working as my apprentice, he very quickly started to change his speech patterns, and started mimicking Mark’s posture and mannerisms. I’d bet that Ma?ne told him to use Mark as a role model at some point.\n\n\n Lutz’s upbringing, which was so completely different from a merchant’s kid’s, left him pretty lacking in a lot of areas when it comes to being a merchant. He’s been frantically trying to cover up all of the ways he’s different from the other apprentices. I’m very well aware that he’s been studying both me and Mark intently, copying even the tiniest little things from us.\n\n\n Kid’s got ambition. I like that a lot.\n\n\n “Lutz, what do you think of pound cake? As a commodity.”\n\n\n “…I think it would undoubtedly sell quite well among the nobility. It’ll probably get a really good reception.”\n\n\n “And what are you basing that on? I’m pretty sure you don’t know anything about what the nobles’ tastes are like or what they usually eat, do you?”\n\n\n I’d tried to cut deep with that question, but Lutz seems particularly unperturbed as he quickly answers.\n\n\n “Umm, I heard from Ma?ne that since Freida is going to be living in the nobles’ quarter, the guild master did everything he could to collect things that the nobility use in their daily lives. This seems to include their cook, who he hired away from a nobleman. That’s why I think that if Freida and that cook are both confident that it’ll sell, then it’ll sell.”\n\n\n “Hmm, alright then.”\n\n\n I actually hadn’t heard much about the guild master’s house. I know that he’d put a lot of money into it, but I didn’t know that he’d gathered things to mimic the nobles’ daily lives. My eyes widen a little in amazement at this information. Looks like I can’t underestimate the value of the information that kids might share between themselves.\n\n\n “Lutz, I’m back!”\n\n\n “Oh, Ma?ne!”\n\n\n Ma?ne returns, wearing the apprentice’s clothes for my shop. Now, if anyone looks at the three of us, nobody will think anything’s odd at all.\n\n\n “Master Benno,” says Lutz, pointing at the cake on the far right table, “this is the pound cake with nothing else added to it. This is the kind that I tried before.”\n\n\n He looks like he’s about to start drooling, maybe because he’s thinking about what it tasted like last time. His eyes are basically glued to the line of cake, glimmering with raw expectation.\n\n\n “Miss Ilse is really enthusiastic about self-improvement, so she’s made it way better than last time. And then also, the cake on this table has ferigine added to it. This table’s cake has honey in it, and that one has walnuts. The one over there is the latest invention, and it’s got tea leaves added to it. Please, try some!”\n\n\n She’s puffed out her chest proudly, as if all of this was her own achievement. I snort, looking down at her, somehow entirely unamused.\n\n\n “And this is because you just told them about all of these varieties, didn’t you?”\n\n\n “Urgh… I, I traded sugar for these, so I wasn’t just giving them ideas for free.”\n\n\n It seems like she somehow managed to trade that information for some sugar for her own personal use. I’m caught between wanting to praise her shrewdness for actually being a little merchant-like and wanting to smack her on the head for giving them such incredibly valuable information.\n\n\n “Also, the only ones I told them about were this ferigine one and the tea leaf one. Most of this is because of Miss Ilse’s research, so it’s not like I came up with all of this.”\n\n\n She looks away, pouting, then reaches for a piece of cake.\n\n\n “You should try this, Mister Benno. It’s good!”\n\n\n She pops the piece of cake in her mouth and savors the taste. Lutz reaches for his own slice, too. Based on the astonished voices that I’m hearing, it’s pretty obvious that it’s actually good. I take a bite as well.\n\n\n What is this?!\n\n\n I could tell from the moment I picked it up that it’s soft and fluffy, and when I put it in my mouth it crumbles and almost melts away. It looks like bread at first glance, but no bread I’ve ever seen has been this tender. Bread is something you dip in soup to eat.\n\n\n I’m also shocked at how I’ve never tasted sweetness like this before. It’s very sweet, but unlike things that have been soaked in honey, it’s not a concentrated, cloying sweetness, nor is it anything like the sweetness of a fruit, but instead a gentle sweetness that spreads all throughout my mouth. That sweetness, mixed with the savory taste of butter, stimulates my appetite and leaves me wanting more.\n\n\n “It’s tasty, right?”\n\n\n Ma?ne looks up at me, eyes glimmering, probably looking for some sort of praise. Honest praise like that just kinda annoys me, so I ignore her, reaching for a piece of the ferigine cake. It’s as light and tender as the first piece, but the aroma of ferigine fills my mouth as well. The taste is refreshing, and it goes down easily. Just by adding a little bit of flavor to it, my impression has changed dramatically. I glance up, looking at the other tables.\n\n\n “Miss Ilse is really great, isn’t she?”\n\n\n I brush off Ma?ne as she talks about how great someone else’s cook is, and move to the next table. I pick up a piece of the honey-laden cake and pop it into my mouth. Unlike the other pieces I’ve eaten so far, this cake is a bit heavier, and the sweetness is much more concentrated. It’s a more familiar taste, and this feels like it’s the sweetest cake out of all of the ones I’ve eaten so far. This’ll probably be the one that’s most popular with kids, who tend to put sweetness above all else.\n\n\n “It’s sweet, but it’s not too heavy, right?”\n\n\n The next is the one with walnuts. It’s the most familiar-looking cake of the bunch, since it resembles bread with walnuts in it. However, the texture is entirely unlike the bread that I normally eat. The cake itself is far lighter, giving the impression that the firm nuts are floating in it. The tender cake quickly melts away in my mouth, leaving only the nuts behind. I think this kind of mouth feel would probably be good if I got used to it, but I don’t really like it all that much.\n\n\n “Hey, Mister Benno. Answer me, please?”\n\n\n “Shut up. You’re too loud.”\n\n\n I hush Ma?ne, who’s been circling restlessly and chirping incessantly at me like the noisiest baby bird, and move on to the final table. The fact that I’m told it has tea leaves in it gives me momentary pause, but when I hesitantly take a bite, the flavor of it really hits me. Unlike the walnuts, the leaves have been thoroughly ground up, so I don’t notice them at all. It definitely tastes like tea, but also like a sweet dessert, which is something entirely new to me. The sweetness isn’t as strong, but it’s still delicious. This, I think, is going to be the most popular with men. At least, it’s my favorite.\n\n\n “Which are you going to vote for, Mister Benno?”\n\n\n Every single one of these cakes is an eye-poppingly fantastic delicacy. These are, without a doubt, going to spread like wildfire amongst the nobility. This is the kind of taste that everyone will crave. It would not be an empty exaggeration to say that there’s a huge difference between these and the desserts already on the market.\n\n\n “Hey, Ma?ne.”\n\n\n “What is it, sir?”\n\n\n “Why’d you give this recipe to the guild master?”\n\n\n For someone trying to break into noble society, this recipe would have been a massive weapon in my arsenal. I would have wanted this. When I glare down at Ma?ne, though, she just blinks, tilting her head to the side.\n\n\n “But I gave it to Miss Ilse, though…”\n\n\n “That old bastard’s the one selling it. Same thing either way.”\n\n\n This pound cake is only going to strengthen that sh*tty old man’s clout amongst the nobles. Ma?ne frowns, concernedly, looking like she’s maybe picked up on my frustration.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, you always seem to have a really bad relationship with the guild master, don’t you? Why’s that?”\n\n\n It suddenly occurs to me that I might not have actually told her that story, but as I think about that, fragments of unpleasant memories flash across my mind.\n\n\n “When I was growing up, he always had it out for my family’s shop, but when my dad died, that utter asshole tried to get my mom to be his second wife so he could absorb the shop too.”\n\n\n One day, when my father had gone out travelling to my uncle’s shop to do some business, he was attacked by a thief, who wanted his money, and was killed in the process. Since he was still near the city when this happened, they were able to recover his corpse, but it was cut up so badly that my mother locked herself away for a while after she saw it. And then that old bastard just gleefully waltzed right in on her in the midst of her grief.\n\n\n “Huh? Th… the guild master wanted her to be his second wife?”\n\n\n “Yeah. She refused, of course, and then after that he started doing one little thing after another to harass us. It’s still going on now! Remember how much trouble we had getting you registered with the guild? How he tried to find any excuse to reject your application?”\n\n\n “A~ahh…”\n\n\n Ma?ne and Lutz both grimace, remembering the times when they’d gotten tangled up in this mess. That sh*tty old man doesn’t just hurt me, he goes after everyone around me, too.\n\n\n “Now, if you had to constantly deal with the kind of person who’d come up to you right when your lover dies and, with a big smile on his face, introduce you to his daughter, or, worse, constantly try to pawn off his sons, who are much older than me, on your little sisters who haven’t even come of age yet, do you think you’d be able to maintain a nice, friendly relationship?”\n\n\n If I were to talk about business too, I’d have all sorts of stories about the unreasonable demands he’s piled on me, but Ma?ne won’t get much meaning out of those kinds of war stories. It’s good enough to just make sure she knows how terrible of a person that old bastard is.\n\n\n “…Ummm, I guess, depending on your point of view, that means that the Gilberta Company is really highly-valued, isn’t it? I’m not saying that the guild master isn’t causing you trouble with how pushy he’s being, though.”\n\n\n She avoided replying directly, but it seems that she basically understands how troublesome that guild master is.\n\n\n “So,” I say, “why did you give that troublesome guild leader your recipe?”\n\n\n “I mean, if you really want to know… all I wanted to really wanted to do was make sweets with Freida, like I’d promised her.”\n\n\n “But then you made a contract, didn’t you?”\n\n\n “It’s just a one-year exclusivity agreement, you know? Is that really something to get so mad at me about?”\n\n\n Putting a time restriction on that contract was remarkably well thought-out for one of Ma?ne’s deals, but I’m not at all assured that she’ll be able to enforce that. I wonder if Freida’s going to be able to coax her into extending the monopoly deadline indefinitely?\n\n\n “…So you’re really going to open the recipe to the public after one year?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir. I don’t want sweets to be monopolized. I want lots of people to be making them!”\n\n\n Even if she’s saying that she only sold them monopoly rights to the recipe for one year, though, if nobody can actually get their hands on sugar, then the guild master’s shop is probably still going to effectively have a monopoly on it. I’ve got a bad feeling that, even though I don’t want to be left behind more than I already have, there’s so many more ways they can pull further ahead.\n\n\n “Say, you mentioned that you know other recipes, didn’t you? You sure you don’t want to sell those to me?”\n\n\n “…Even if I did sell them to you, you wouldn’t be able to do anything with them, right? You don’t have any sugar or any cooks.”\n\n\n She stares at me blankly, head tilted.\n\n\n “What do you mean?”\n\n\n “All of the recipes for sweets that I know require sugar. But, more importantly, the most important thing I need is a really good cook. If they’re not as skilled as someone who’s worked in a noble house, then even if I told them what the recipe is, they wouldn’t immediately be able to recreate it.”\n\n\n “Why a noble house…?”\n\n\n “Because they need to be able to use an oven whenever they want. I don’t think that there’s ovens anywhere except bakeries, so they’re not really spreading, are they?”\n\n\n There aren’t very many households that have their own personal ovens. Generally, unless you’re very rich or a gourmand, there’s no real need for one. So, in other words, the guild master’s house has an oven, and they also have someone who is capable of using it well.\n\n\n “Oh my,” snickers a child from behind me, “it looks like I might be able to buy all of Ma?ne’s recipes before you can even get all of your things together. Our cook, after all, is always hungry for new recipes.”\n\n\n I turn to look, and see the guild master’s daughter, with hair the color of spring flowers gathered into bunches over each of her ears.\n\n\n “Good afternoon, Mister Benno. Good afternoon, Lutz.”\n\n\n The way her eyes are so full of challenge when she looks up at me is exactly like that old bastard. I kept trying to tell myself that if that sh*tty old man disappeared one day, my life would get a little easier, but I can’t underestimate this girl. She’s got the same nose for money her grandfather does, the way she’s been getting so close to Ma?ne.\n\n\n Despite the fact that Ma?ne has been increasingly vigilant against me, when she sees Freida, she smiles widely and waves at her, greeting her in a friendly way. I can’t help but be a little irritated at just how well they’re getting along.\n\n\n “Freida! How’s the party going?”\n\n\n “Spectacularly, thanks to your help. Everyone is loving the pound cake. And, since you’ve been talking about releasing the recipe in a year’s time, there’s no small number of people looking forward to that as well!”\n\n\n How many times do I have to tell this idiot to be more careful until she gets it!\n\n\n I’ve managed to trick her a few times, but every single time she unhappily puffs out her cheeks and then still follows through. She doesn’t watch out for the kinds of expressions people are making, how much attention they’re paying, or even whether or not they’re testing her. She lacks so much wariness that I’m actually concerned. I’m convinced that the concept of wariness just fell out of her head at some point and she never bothered to go looking for it.\n\n\n Even still, as an adult watching from the sidelines, there’s no way that I can intrude on two little girls having a friendly chat with each other. Unless she makes some sort of promise or gets caught up in something strange, the only thing I can do is stand here with Lutz, glaring at the two of them.\n\n\n “Lutz,” I say. “How can that girl be so friendly with someone who used the fact that she was on her deathbed to swindle her?”\n\n\n “…I don’t think I know how she thinks most of the time. Also, I don’t really like Freida all that much.”\n\n\n It’s plainly written on his face how much he wants Freida to stay away from Ma?ne. It’s a difficult to tell if the desire to monopolize her that I can see in his green eyes is because she’s his most important friend, or if this has already blossomed into romance. Either way, when I see how much Lutz cares for Ma?ne, I can’t help but remember bittersweet memories of my lover from years ago that I’d put aside when she’d died, which leaves me with an itchy, uncomfortable feeling.\n\n\n “You’re in for a rough ride, Lutz,” I say.\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n “Keeping hold of Ma?ne isn’t going to be an easy task at all.”\n\n\n I rustle his hair as I encourage him. He looks up at me, green eyes gleaming, and nods slowly.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, how’s everything tasting?”\n\n\n A sturdily-built woman approaches, greeting Ma?ne as if she knows her from somewhere. A sweet smell rolls off of her body, and she has a cloth covering her face to show that she’s part of the staff. Lutz and I look at her, on our guards, wondering who she is. Ma?ne, on the other hand, smiles broadly, running over to her.\n\n\n “It’s amazingly delicious, of course!” says Ma?ne. “I’d tried a little before, but you’ve made a lot of improvements to the cake with the tea in it! I knew you could do it.”\n\n\n “Glad to hear it,” says the woman, grinning broadly at Ma?ne’s praise.\n\n\n It seems that this woman is the cook who works at the guild master’s house and the person who made this pound cake. I size her up, as any merchant would, studying the cook who was poised to make the guild master a lot of money. She looks back at me.\n\n\n “Ah, you’re Mister Benno, then?”\n\n\n “Yeah, I am, and?”\n\n\n I don’t really understand why the guild master’s cook would be calling to me. Did Ma?ne do something again? As I scowl, Ilse looks me up and down.\n\n\n “…Hmm.”\n\n\n The look in her eyes when she studies me, like she’s trying to figure out who she’s up against, reminds me a lot of the guild master. I narrow my eyes. If I’m going up against a young girl like Freida, her immaturity might cause me to unconsciously hold back, but against an adult, I need exercise no such restraint.\n\n\n “Ah, so you’re the one who’s trying to tie Ma?ne up and hog all of her knowledge to herself, are you?”\n\n\n “Hm? Well, some job I’m doing, then. You’re the one with her pound cake recipe, aren’t you?”\n\n\n It’s true that I’d like to monopolize whatever information I can, but Ma?ne refuses to just sit there and let me do it. Ilse describes it as tying her up, but even the stuff that accidentally falls out of Ma?ne’s mouth has the potential to throw the market into chaos, so, honestly, being careful about parceling out what she knows is for the best.\n\n\n “I’m generally the one who has to pick up after this kid,” I say, “but you’ve managed to snatch up whatever tasty things she thinks up, haven’t you?”\n\n\n For Ma?ne’s sake, I’ve gathered all sorts of information, arranged for contract magic in order to strengthen her connection with Lutz, formed a papermaker’s association to hide her identity, and done so many other things in the shadows. That thoughtless girl isn’t causing the guild master any trouble at all. No, that all falls on me.\n\n\n “But Mister Benno,” says Ma?ne, pouting, “you’re always ripping me off, aren’t you?”\n\n\n I flick her forehead. “The money I saved on the rinsham by ripping you off went straight into those two magical contracts, you know?”\n\n\n “Huh?” she says.\n\n\n “…Two magical contracts?” says Freida.\n\n\n The two girls look up at me with the same foolish expression, their mouths hanging open in shock. I shrug.\n\n\n “Seriously, you don’t even know what I go through…”\n\n\n “I don’t particularly care what you’re going through,” says the cook. “Ma?ne’s said that she’s only going to hand her recipes over to people that she thinks can actually make them. You can do whatever you want with whatever else she’s got, but her recipes are mine.”\n\n\n This is a declaration of war. It seems like even that old geezer’s staff have it out for me.\n\n\n “Hand them over, huh?”\n\n\n As if I’d let the guild master keep a monopoly on pound cake forever! Over the next year, before that monopoly agreement expires, I need to find a good cook. I can probably get a lead on sugar if I lean on some of my distant relatives, so it’ll take some doing but I’ll probably manage to get my hands on some of that.\n\n\n As I continue to glare at Ilse, countless calculations flying about in my head, Ma?ne tugs urgently on my sleeve, a worried expression on her face.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, Mister Benno! It’ll be really hard to find a cook, you know? If you don’t have an intermediary you can use to get in touch with the nobility, then it’ll be kinda impossible.”\n\n\n “Why would I need an intermediary? All I’m looking for is someone who can use an oven and is into self-improvement, right?”\n\n\n All that the whole needing someone good enough to work in a noble house thing boils down to is that I need someone who can get good at using an oven. It’s not like I actually need someone who’s actually, literally worked in a noble house themselves.\n\n\n “Ma?ne,” I say, “you know how you keep saying that since there’s no books you’re going to make them yourself? So, what would you do if you didn’t have a cook?”\n\n\n “I’d… train one myself?”\n\n\n “Exactly.”\n\n\n I’ll get the facilities ready, find a good cook from somewhere in this city, and then train them up and get them specialized specifically in making pastries.\n\n\n “…Let’s give this a shot, hm?”"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n My name is Mark. I am the assistant to Master Benno, the manager of the Gilberta Company. I believe I’m just about thirty-seven years of age, if I recall correctly. When one is as old as I am, one’s age isn’t something that is clearly remembered.\n\n\n I have served the Gilberta Company since its previous manager was in charge. If you include my time as an apprentice, they have employed me for thirty years of my life. The year I started apprenticing at this shop as a dalua was the year that Master Benno was born, so the years have passed amazingly quickly.\n\n\n There are two types of apprenticeships amongst merchants and tradesmen: dalua and dapla. To explain it succinctly, a dalua makes a contract with the shop’s manager to simply work at the shop for a fixed term, while a dapla studies towards being able to assist in the management and affairs of the shop itself. There are substantial differences in the contract fees and the contents of the contract themselves, but at this moment there is no need for a thorough explanation.\n\n\n The Gilberta Company, essentially, employs the children of other shops as dalua. The sons and daughters of merchants spend a certain amount of their lives studying at other shops. The particular duration of this stay is a matter of negotiation between the shop’s management and the child’s parents. I believe the most common arrangements are between three and four years, perhaps.\n\n\n The reasons for doing this are manifold. By working at another shop, the child’s field of view is widened, they’re placed in a position where they are put to work, they’re removed from a place where they may be coddled, they make friends with other children who will eventually become the next generation of shopkeepers, and so on, but most importantly they serve as metaphorical bridges built between shops.\n\n\n My original employment at the Gilberta Company was as a dalua, with the intent that when my contract expired I would return to my family’s shop. However, during my employment, my father passed away, and my eldest brother took his place as the shop’s manager. His attitudes towards commerce, however, were too different from my own, so rather than returning to my family’s shop, I chose to renew my contract as a dalua several times. Eventually, when I came of age at fifteen years old I signed a contract to become a dapla instead.\n\n\n The term of apprenticeship for a dapla is eight years. In essence, when a child finishes their apprenticeship as a dalua at another shop, sometime between the ages of ten and twelve, they transition towards becoming a dapla instead. By the time they are twenty years of age, they have become capable of being entrusted with the affairs of the shop in place of the manager.\n\n\n Since I had begun my apprenticeship as a dapla so late, I spent the first eight years of my adult life in renewed study. Of course, although I may say that it was eight years of study, in truth, I had already worked as a dalua at the shop for eight years, so I was already very much familiar with the operations of the Gilberta Company. Thanks to the good graces of the previous manager, I was not paid an apprentice’s wage as would be typical of a dapla, but was instead paid as much as any other adult employee of the shop. Thus, the prospect of eight additional years of study was not at all particularly painful. I was thrilled at how much better my treatment was compared to when I had been a dalua, and I threw myself into my work with zeal.\n\n\n However, not all remained well. When my period of apprenticeship as a dapla was on the verge of completion, the shop’s manager unfortunately passed away. Master Benno, at the time, had only just reached adulthood himself, and there was much concern that he was not yet ready to manage the shop on his own. Of the dalua who had formed a contract with the previous manager, there was no small number who declined to reestablish their contracts under Master Benno.\n\n\n As my own term of employment had not yet finished, in order to ensure that I could continue to work at the Gilberta Company, I proposed to my family that our own shop could lend their assistance to Master Benno. However, my eldest brother, who was still in charge of the shop, not only refused to offer any support, but went so far as to sneer at the death of the previous manager and sever all ties between my family’s shop and the Gilberta Corporation.\n\n\n I wonder, how I might best describe the anger I felt at that moment? The instant that I swore an oath to myself to say my farewells to my family and remain at the Gilberta Company to support it and its new manager to the bitter end remains exceptionally vivid in my memory, even to this day.\n\n\n When my term of apprenticeship as dapla to Master Benno ended, he asked me if I would be returning to my family’s shop. I, however, had already severed ties with my family and thus had nowhere I could go. Moreover, the shop that needed my efforts the most was still the Gilberta Company. After I expressed this to him, the two of us threw ourselves headlong into the hard work of reviving the company. We quickly returned it to its original state, and shortly thereafter were able to grow it yet larger. The work I did in the shadows to use my own family’s shop as a mere stepping stone along the path to the Gilberta Company’s resurgence is a story best left untold.\n\n\n The eldest daughter of the previous manager, Miss Corinna, became married. Master Benno, however, lost all interest in marriage after his lover, Liese, passed away. I as well never married; while I was so absorbed in my work, my marriageable years passed me by without my noticing. Life, it seems, never goes as one might think it would.\n\n\n Because our work is going so well, and because Master Benno has decided that Miss Corinna’s children will inherit the shop, I can now say that our days are free of any problems that might imperil the future of the shop.\n\n\n Now then; as there is a meeting today which must be attended by the owners of all large shops, Master Benno is currently absent. As such, each of the important matters that need immediate decisions made have been brought to me.\n\n\n “Mister Mark, the rinsham workshop has contacted us to let us know that their shipment will be delayed,” says one employee.\n\n\n “I see. The shipment of leve they were expecting was delayed as well, so it’s only to be expected. Please contact the foreman and ask him to have whatever they have already completed delivered immediately, and to finish the rest of it as soon as they can.”\n\n\n “Um, Mister Mark,” says another employee. “We’ve received a commission request for Miss Corinna from Baron Bron’s daughter.”\n\n\n “It’s rare for her to commission a garment in the summer. We should hurry, I think. Please deliver that to Miss Corinna immediately.”\n\n\n Some time passes, slightly more busily than usual, after which Master Benno returns to the shop, carrying Ma?ne in his arms.\n\n\n “Mark, let’s talk. Come!”\n\n\n He walks quickly towards his office in the back, eyes blazing with determination. Ma?ne looks perplexed. Lutz hurries along behind them, out of breath. I suddenly have a bad feeling that I’m about to be handed another unreasonable request.\n\n\n So far, I’ve had to procure the materials and ingredients for the rinsham workshop, run around like mad to ensure a market for the rinsham would exist so that I could provide guarantees to the craftsmen, scour the entire town to find the tools and materials that Ma?ne and Lutz requested as part of their paper-making experiments, aid in the efforts to reduce tension with the parchment makers’ association, and effectively do absolutely everything to establish the full-scale workshop for paper production… Now that I think about it, it seems that this last year has seen quite a few unreasonable tasks forced onto me. What might this next thing be now?\n\n\n “Mark, we’re going to train cooks to make desserts! Get ready!”\n\n\n Train cooks to make desserts? The suggestion that has just flown from his mouth has absolutely nothing to do with any of our business thus far. I have an astoundingly bad feeling about this. There is no doubt: the abruptness of this must have come as the result of something Ma?ne has done. As for Master Benno, his eyes are glimmering with determination as he digs through stacks of wooden boards, verifying something or other. I am pleased to see him so energetic, but at the same time I feel like this may have terrible impact on those around him.\n\n\n “When you speak of dessert cooks, what in the world do you plan to have them make?”\n\n\n “Ask Ma?ne.”\n\n\n Ah, so this truly is Ma?ne’s doing? It seems that, somehow, another difficult problem has reared its head.\n\n\n Originally, the Gilberta Company was founded so that Master Benno’s great-grandmother, Gilberta, could sell her wares. Essentially, the wife would make her wares at the company workshop, while the husband handled the sales. The husband’s name has always been the one registered as the owner of the company, but the true line of ownership has ultimately been matrilineal.\n\n\n The Gilberta Company’s core clientele is the rich people of the city, but the designs that Master Benno’s mother came up with attracted the attention of some of the lower-ranked nobility. As such, the company has been able to gain a small amount of influence in noble society. Its ability to do business with the nobility has only come about within the past decade. It is a very recent thing. As Miss Corinna’s fashion sense continues to hold some interest in noble society, the Gilberta Company’s position could be said to be very stable.\n\n\n In other words, the Gilberta Company trades in clothing, accessories, and other such beauty products.\n\n\n The rinsham that Ma?ne brought to us is an excellent beauty product that has become very highly valued among our clients, and the hairpins that Miss Corinna’s workshop will soon be making have already gathered quite some interest amongst the people of the city. Miss Corinna herself has expressed profound joy over being granted the rights to produce the hairpins, saying that if one were to adjust the quality of the thread and the designs, it is likely that they would be well-received amongst the wives and daughters of the nobility.\n\n\n However, on the other hand, the plant-based paper that Ma?ne brought to us caused the Gilberta Company to stray somewhat from its path, and the training of dessert cooks is something entirely different than any of the business that we’ve been a part of to date. Just what in the world could Master Benno be thinking, I wonder?\n\n\n “What I’m trying to tell you,” says Ma?ne, “is that if you don’t have any sugar, then this entire thing is pointless!”\n\n\n “Even if they don’t have any sugar they can still bake bread. That’s good practice for using an oven, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “But bread workshops already exist, which means that a bread-maker’s association already exists, which means that we’re going to have another battle over people’s vested interests! Even if it’s just practice! And on top of that, weren’t you planning on hiring away people who already work at bread workshops, too?!”\n\n\n “If you’re always so concerned about vested interests, then how can you ever get anything new off the ground?!”\n\n\n Master Benno sits in his chair. Across from him, Ma?ne is on a chair of her own, standing on her knees so that her eye level is the same as his. Watching the two of them go back and forth like this reminds me strongly of how he used to argue with Miss Liese. I wonder if it would be better to describe them as being on too good terms for a quarrel to shake, or as them having such trust in each other to the point where they can have fights like this without caring too much?\n\n\n It has seemed that, as of late, Master Benno has never been quite so lively as he is when he is fighting with Ma?ne over matters of business. Perhaps it’s because cornering a skillful speaker like Ma?ne in an argument gives him the same joy as when he was able to best Miss Liese in one of there quarrels. This, incidentally, did not happen very often.\n\n\n “Lutz,” I say, “perhaps we should leave those two to their own devices. Could you please describe to me what happened to bring this about? Why did Master Benno suddenly decide that he needed to train cooks to make desserts?”\n\n\n “Ah, yes,” he replies.\n\n\n Lutz, who had been staring at the the two of them as they fought, startles, straightens up, and begins to explain to me what had happened. Since he is so used to being thrown around at Ma?ne’s whims, his mind is remarkably agile at switching to a new focus. He is capable of quietly absorbing any information thrown at him and has a very patient personality. He could be described as someone with talents that are hard to come by. He smoothly recounts the events of the day in an easy-to-understand order, as if he had done this all his life.\n\n\n According to his explanation, after the meeting at the merchants’ guild, a tasting party was held for pound cake, during which it seems that Master Benno got into a fight with the guild master’s cook. He declared, says Lutz, that if he does not have a cook capable of making sweets, then there’s nothing stopping him from training one himself.\n\n\n Master Benno does not like to lose, and it seems that in this case he was simply unable to bear it.\n\n\n “What Ma?ne was saying,” says Lutz, “is that in order to make desserts, one needs a cook capable of skillfully using an oven. They must also have an enquiring mind and not be afraid to spend a lot of time experimenting with the recipe to make it more delicious. Master Benno was originally thinking that he would be able to find someone who had already mastered the use of ovens at a bread workshop, but Ma?ne said that since they would wind up making things other than bread, it seems that unless they’re enthusiastic something new, it wouldn’t go particularly well…”\n\n\n After Lutz finishes explaining the circumstances, I finally start to see the points of compromise that could be reached in the argument between Master Benno and Ma?ne.\n\n\n “It seems that Master Benno has determined that these desserts would be suitable for selling to the nobility, then?”\n\n\n “Yes, but―”\n\n\n “Lutz, you cannot say ‘but’. When Master Benno is determined to do something, we have no choice but to follow along.”\n\n\n This may reflect my own particular partiality towards Master Benno, but I believe that he has an excellent sense for matters of business. I cannot recall any instances where he has decided something will sell and, after pursuing that goal with all of his power, failed to make a profit.\n\n\n I clap my hands together twice, drawing both Master Benno and Ma?ne’s attention to me.\n\n\n “Master Benno, when you say that you are going to be training dessert cooks, might I ask how long you believe that would take? Would such an action be profitable?”\n\n\n He quietly nods. “…Yeah, it’d be profitable. I’m planning on hiring someone who’s already able to use an oven from a bread workshop and using them to teach other people, so that shouldn’t take that much time.”\n\n\n His eyes are full of self confidence, and his face shows that he’s not seeing even the tiniest sliver of a chance for failure.\n\n\n “As Ma?ne has just said that one cannot make her desserts without sugar, you must believe it is possible for you to acquire some, then?”\n\n\n “It’s been a while since I talked to my relatives, but if I reach out to them, I think I’ll be able to manage something, even if it’ll be a little bit tough. I think Uncle Emil might have a bit of influence in Central? I could also have Otto get in touch with his friends from his trading days. In the meantime, I can have the workers make bread in order to get them used to working with ovens.”\n\n\n “Hm,” I reply. “it certainly does not seem entirely impossible.”\n\n\n It seems that because it is impossible to secure victory when there are fundamentally zero chances for success, Master Benno has been considering how he might acquire sugar from the moment Ma?ne had started talking about desserts.\n\n\n Arranging for a workshop and purchasing ovens is a tedious and complicated process, but is not exceptionally difficult. It does seem that, after all, the most significant problem that must be dealt with will be negotiating with those businesses that already have vested interest in this field. I dare say that the guild master will likely have objections of his own, as well. Thinking back on all of the strife that had happened with the parchment makers’ association when we wished to start selling plant-based paper makes my eyes narrow. These disputes that have happened over these things outside of our core business, like making paper or training cooks, are exceedingly difficult compared to the rest of my work.\n\n\n “Ma?ne,” I say, “might you have some idea as to how we might avoid strife with the bread makers’ association, similar to the solution you came up with to ensure we did not encroach on the profits of the parchment makers’ association?”\n\n\n “Huh?! You want me to think that up?!”\n\n\n Master Benno is a man who prefers to solve his problems by breaking through them with sheer force and fundamentally dislikes compromise. Ma?ne, who is unskilled at direct conflict and thus avoids them as much as possible, is much more suited to finding a good compromise. Not to mention, the training of dessert cooks is so far out of my area of expertise that I don’t have the background information required to find any points of common ground.\n\n\n “Of the four of us here, I believe you must be the one most familiar with the topic of dessert cooks, are you not? Because you are thus much more suited than Master Benno to find points of common ground, please, help us determine if there is any view that would allow both parties to still profit.”\n\n\n I am fully aware that this is an unreasonable demand to be making of a young girl who has only barely just been baptized, but I, along with Master Benno, do not think of Ma?ne as an ordinary little girl.\n\n\n “Eh?! Umm… common ground? I mean, you’re, kinda putting me on the spot, but, uh… if you want both sides to profit, umm…”\n\n\n “Let me see… perhaps there might be some other kind of bread besides the bread being produced now, or something one might use an oven for besides making bread…”\n\n\n As she broods, I offer her a couple of suggestions, reframing the ideas from her paper compromise so that they might apply to bread. Nothing at all comes to my mind, of course, but since Ma?ne is a constant font of strange ideas, I believe that there must be something that she will be able to think of.\n\n\n Confirming my hypothesis, Ma?ne quickly turns her head to face me, her dark blue hair swinging behind her. Her golden eyes glimmer as she shoots her left hand straight up into the air.\n\n\n “There is something! I’ve really been craving 'Italian’ food!”\n\n\n “…'Italian’?”\n\n\n She’s brought out a word I’ve never heard before. Both Master Benno and Lutz tilt their heads, looking at her funnily, but Ma?ne seems to not care in the slightest as she launches into the topic.\n\n\n “Even if we don’t have any sugar, then if there’s a style of cooking that uses an oven, then that’s still good practice, right? So if we can make things like 'pizza’, 'gratin’ dishes, or 'lasagna’, then that’ll definitely work. …Ah! Also, also, you can cook meat in an oven, and also make things like 'quiches’ and 'pies’, too. Aaah, I can’t wait!”\n\n\n Ma?ne cheerfully lists off name after name of possible dishes, but based on the fact that she mentioned cooking meat in the oven, I can’t imagine that the rest of them are any sort of dessert. She looks off into the distance, eyes sparkling, looking so entranced by the idea of food that she might start drooling at any moment. Lutz, standing next to me, lets out a small groan.\n\n\n “Uh oh. She’s going wild again.”\n\n\n “Oh?” I reply.\n\n\n “She’s imagining something that she really wants. Once she sets her mind on something, she blazes forward at full speed… I don’t know if Master Benno’s going to be able to win, huh?”\n\n\n The way he’s groaning makes it easy to understand that Ma?ne’s rampages often involve forcefully dragging him around to do things. She and Master Benno are very much alike, it seems. Once they have an objective in mind, they blaze directly towards it, perhaps not even realizing the hardships they may cause others around them in the process.\n\n\n “Mister Benno,” she says, “let’s just give up on desserts. We should make a 'restaurant’… ah, um, a kind of high-class place where you can eat food.”\n\n\n “Hey, wait! You can’t just declare that we’re giving up like that!”\n\n\n “Oh, once we get sugar, we can also make 'Italian’ desserts there too. It’s fine! Let’s make 'Italian’.”\n\n\n “What about that is fine?!”\n\n\n As Lutz feared, Master Benno appears to be losing. I realize just how similar Lutz and my situations are, with how he is dragged around by Ma?ne and how I am dragged around by Master Benno. I shed a tear for him, in my mind.\n\n\n “Lutz, you must strengthen your heart. Do not let yourself simply be dragged around. You need to learn to predict when she might start to run wild. If you can turn things around before you get dragged into them, your life will be much easier.”\n\n\n “Mister Mark…?”\n\n\n “There’s a knack for everything, even getting dragged into things.”\n\n\n Lutz looks up at me, his green eyes shining with pure admiration. Looking down at him, I silently swear to myself that I will train him to the best of my capabilities so that no matter what unreasonable things he and Ma?ne find themselves doing, he will be able to bear it fully.\n\n\n The entire time that the two of us were sharing our moment of appreciation for each others’ hardships, Ma?ne has not stopped talking. She is currently describing reason after reason as to why establishing an eatery is superior to simply starting a workshop.\n\n\n “What I’m saying is that if you can cook anything, not just sweets, then that’s way more marketable, you know? And if you’re offering the food that the workers make for practice to real customers, then not only is the food not going to waste, but the workers themselves will be way more motivated, right? And then if you get to a point where they can start making sweets, then before you start selling them to the nobility, then you can have your customers sample them first, and use their feedback to make it even better!”\n\n\n As Ma?ne lists her arguments, with levels of both persuasiveness and expression that one wouldn’t think would come out of the mouth of a child, Lutz looks up at me, eyebrows lowered, looking concerned.\n\n\n “I… when I hear how passionate she is, I can’t help but start thinking that she might actually be right,” he says.\n\n\n I hum thoughtfully, nodding. “The ability to make someone want to buy what you’re selling is a much sought-after talent amongst merchants.”\n\n\n Lutz shrugs, giving me a small smile. “In Ma?ne’s case though, it’s a talent she doesn’t actually use at all unless it’s for something she wants.”\n\n\n “Take care to watch how she says things to convince others of what she’s saying. Remember, everything around you can be an example to learn from.”\n\n\n The persuasive power to make your opponent believe what you do is a very attractive ability, but ultimately, if Lutz is to manage a shop in the future, he cannot live a life of merely being dragged along by Ma?ne’s zeal.\n\n\n “All that aside, Lutz. Is Ma?ne all right? I can’t help but wonder if she might be a little too zealous…”\n\n\n “Aah! Ma?ne! Calm down a little!”\n\n\n As soon as he says that, Ma?ne stops talking, and flops over onto the table, resting her head on its surface. It seems that she really has overdone it. Even still, it seems that she has yet more to say. While laying on the top, she starts mumbling, continuing her previous thought.\n\n\n “There’s a huge difference between what rich people eat and what the nobility eat, you know. If you can provide tasty food, I think that people will absolutely come to eat it, even if it’s a little pricey. Definitely.”\n\n\n “A huge difference? Where in the world would you have learned about what nobles eat… the guild master, huh?”\n\n\n “See? You’re interested too, aren’t you?” She chuckles gleefully. “They’re really different. But, you still have a chance. I’ve still got plenty of information that I haven’t given over to Miss Ilse yet, after all.”\n\n\n I can tell that her words have swayed Master Benno significantly, but at this point, he should not be making any firm decisions. He needs to step back, calm down, and go over Ma?ne’s proposal with careful, deliberate thought. If there are so many points in this plan’s favor, then there must be points against it as well.\n\n\n “As you say,” I interject, “we must carefully consider whether or not we truly need to train workers to be able to make desserts. Ma?ne, thank you very much for this wonderful suggestion. It is an enormous help. Won’t you return home and take care of your own needs, though? You must be quite tired after pushing Master Benno around like that.”\n\n\n “Oooh, Mister Mark,” she says, still slumped over the table, “your kindness always goes straight to my heart.”\n\n\n I instruct Lutz to ensure that Ma?ne makes it home safely, then see the two of them out of the shop. After I see them off, I return to the back office, to find Master Benno slumped over like Ma?ne was just a moment ago, his face buried in a pile of documents.\n\n\n “Master Benno?”\n\n\n “Seriously. That girl’s just full of surprises, isn’t she.”\n\n\n “You are very right. I did not expect in the slightest that her plan to avoid friction with the bread makers’ association would have turned into that.”\n\n\n Master Benno scratches his head, rustling his hair, as he slowly sits upright. He looks at me, a sharp glint in his reddish-brown eyes.\n\n\n “…What do you think, Mark?”\n\n\n “I do believe that it would be easier to establish an eatery than it would be to train workers to make desserts. With an eatery, we don’t risk starting any conflicts with the bread makers’ association. Instead, we would have to consider how we would deal with the food vendors’ association, but if we properly follow the processes in place, I do not think that the act of establishing the shop itself would be particularly difficult.”\n\n\n “Agreed.”\n\n\n Ma?ne’s proposal is for a high-class place to eat. A shop such as that should not disturb the much cheaper vendors that operate in the town marketplace, so I am comfortable considering that the food vendors’ association will not put forth any significant opposition.\n\n\n “An eatery isn’t a bad idea. A lot of rich people already employ cooking girls, but those girls are, fundamentally, commoners. So, even if you throw a lot of money at them, all that’ll happen is that you’ll be able to eat a lot of food. The actual food itself isn’t going to change all that much. The food the nobility eat uses recipes that can’t be made unless you have a very good cook working in a noble house, so everything of course tastes different, and there’s a difference in variety. Even if it’s somewhat expensive, considering the subject matter and the flavors involved, I believe a such a shop might be successful.”\n\n\n I have never myself had the opportunity to eat the food of noblemen, so I do not have a clear understanding of what’s at play here. Master Benno, however, has eaten it a number of times that could be counted on one hand, as a result of being invited to a meal by a nobleman on several occasions. If Master Benno says so, then I have no doubt that there are significant differences between the food that the nobility eat and the food that merely very wealthy people eat.\n\n\n “However, how does Ma?ne know recipes for noble food? That girl’s only been at the guild master’s house for a few days total. Why does she know so many different varieties of recipes? How can she just produce recipes that require an oven off the top of her head?”\n\n\n “Because she is Ma?ne, sir.”\n\n\n I sigh as I answer his question. He seems dissatisfied by my answer, but I have no better explanation to give.\n\n\n “Mark, you just—”\n\n\n “It’s pointless to waste time thinking on questions we cannot answer. Weren’t you the one who said that it doesn’t matter who she was as long as she was useful to us merchants, back when she sold us the rinsham? Even after all this time, we’ve learned nothing new. It’s a far better use of our time to instead think of ways to ensure that we do not let her precious information leak out to anyone else.”\n\n\n I shrug my shoulders and shake my head. Benno glances away, as if he felt bad about something, then claps his hands, awkwardly and abruptly changing the topic of conversation.\n\n\n “Ah, well, sure, but… I’ve been thinking of adopting Lutz. What do you think, Mark?”\n\n\n “It would seem that Ma?ne is having quite the influence on you, sir, if you are blurting out ideas that you haven’t actually thought through.”\n\n\n “Huuhhh? Well that’s rude! Don’t lump me in with that thoughtless little kid!”\n\n\n No matter how threateningly he shouts at me, I can’t imagine this idea of adopting Lutz to be anything but thoughtless. If it isn’t, what in the world could he possibly be thinking? If Master Benno, the manager of a shop, is seeking an adoptive son, perhaps he is looking to find an heir amongst the people around him. This would be troublesome for him to do so, however, as it would sow the seeds of strife with Miss Corinna, who has yet to bear a child.\n\n\n “Well then, if you truly have a reason as to why you would propose something that would cause such great discord between you and Miss Corinna, would you perhaps explain your careful thinking?”\n\n\n He sighs. “You’re just going to pick this apart, aren’t you,” he grumbles, before explaining why he wants to adopt Lutz.\n\n\n “First, if we want to keep our connections with Ma?ne, we absolutely need to secure Lutz. You’re with me so far, right?”\n\n\n “You’re quite right.”\n\n\n I already am aware that, because of the magical contract that stipulates that the things Maine’s Workshop produces will be sold through Lutz, keeping hold of him is very much necessary. Additionally, as Lutz is currently employed as a dalua, when his period of employment is over, if he were to have the inclination to go to somebody else’s shop, he would be entirely capable of doing so. It would seem that preventing this from happening is Master Benno’s objective.\n\n\n “I was thinking I could hire him on as a dapla, but I’ve been thinking that if I want someone that I can definitely trust with the shop, then maybe adopting him to carve out a more solid position would be a better idea.”\n\n\n “Wouldn’t hiring him as a dapla be enough, in that case? If you truly need someone you can definitely trust, then when Miss Corinna gives birth to a daughter, would you not be able to have them marry?”\n\n\n Rather than raising him as an adopted son, giving him a thorough education as a dapla, then having him marry into the family would cause far less strife, I believe. Master Benno, however, merely shrugs, waving his hand dismissively.\n\n\n “That’s not going to work with Lutz. He’s only got eyes for Ma?ne. Either way, Lutz’s original dream was to become a trader. He’s been looking for a chance to leave the city. And that’s even more reason why I think that tying him down to this shop is going to be really difficult.”\n\n\n “…A trader, you say? That’s…”\n\n\n This is quite surprising. It’s very rare for someone born and raised in a city to dream of becoming a trader.\n\n\n Benno shrugs his shoulders, quirking up the corners of his mouth. “I’ve been thinking that the main reason for that was because his life at home was so constrained, but honestly, if he didn’t have Ma?ne tying him down, there’d be nothing keeping him here. There’s no doubt about how Ma?ne’s going to be swallowed up by the nobility in the near future. I don’t know if it’s going to be the nobility in this city, or if she’s going to get tangled up with some other city’s nobility, or even get called all the way out to Central, but… I don’t know just what the odds are, but there’s a good chance that she’s going to leave this city at some point or another.”\n\n\n Lutz is currently an apprentice under Master Benno’s patronage, and he has neither knowledge nor anything else that he can use. However, by the time he comes of age, he will have learned quite a lot, and most likely come to realize his own worth. If by this point Ma?ne has been removed from the city and their magical contract rendered meaningless, it’s entirely possible that he might leave for a shop in another city.\n\n\n “When Ma?ne leaves this city, I want to be in a position to follow her with Lutz in tow.”\n\n\n My eyes narrow slightly. “Why would you go that far, sir?”\n\n\n He gives me a slightly troubled smile. “The actual successor to the Gilberta Company is Corinna. I’m just a middleman. Ma?ne says she wants to make books, but that’s not what this shop does. This isn’t going to be anytime soon, but I’m thinking that maybe I what I really want is to leave the shop to Corinna and Otto and build my own, separate shop.”\n\n\n Ownership of the Gilberta Company is in fact matrilineal, so he is correct: the ones to which the shop should be entrusted are Corinna and Otto. However, I can’t quite make the connection between his desire for independence and his intentions for Lutz. As I look at him curiously, he sighs. “Mark can keep a secret,” he mutters to himself, and a nostalgic smile floats across his face.\n\n\n “Lately, when I’ve been watching Ma?ne and Lutz, I’ve been remembering how I used to be. When my dad was still alive, when I didn’t have anything to worry about in my life… like how I used to be when I was together with Liese.”\n\n\n The way Lutz and Ma?ne interact with each other is very reminiscent of the way Miss Liese and Master Benno used to laugh together. I can understand, somewhat, what he is feeling. I can almost see, in the corner of my eye, images of the two of them playing grown-up in the back of the shop or sneakily planning some sort of mischief.\n\n\n “Looking at those two made me remember. I had a dream, once, before my dad died and I put all of my efforts to keeping this shop and my family safe…”\n\n\n “Ah yes, your dream of becoming a merchant respected around the whole world.”\n\n\n As soon as I say that, Master Benno’s eyes go wide, falling into such a state of disarray that he appears, quite frankly, amusing.\n\n\n He points accusingly at me. “Wh… why do you remember that?!”\n\n\n “Because it was your dream, sir.”\n\n\n I do not want this to be taken lightly. I have known Master Benno ever since he was born. As I puff my chest out with pride, he clutches his head, moaning. He is quite terrible at dealing with people who know all of the little details about his childish past. I’m very aware of this. After a moment of continuing to hold his head and grumble, he clears his throat, as to free himself from his momentary embarrassment.\n\n\n “If I can keep implementing every one of the things that Ma?ne’s got in her head, I can actually achieve that dream, can’t I?”\n\n\n “…This may sound pretentious, but if you indeed can realize everything that Ma?ne describes, then you truly will gain the respect of the world.”\n\n\n “So, to start, I’m going to go to the cities my brothers and sisters are in, get paper-making workshops set up there, and start trying to distribute this vegetable-based paper. …Mark, what will you do?”\n\n\n He looks up at me, head tilted slightly to the side, leaning back in his chair with his fingers laced together in front of him. Seeing him stare at me, waiting for an answer, almost makes me laugh out loud. After all, when the shop’s previous manager had died, my educational period had ended, and he’d asked me whether or not I would be leaving the shop, he’d worn exactly the same expression on his face.\n\n\n “I think that Theo might be much better at dealing with Mister Otto than I would be. I’ll come with you. After all, Lutz will need training, won’t he?”\n\n\n “…Alright then.”\n\n\n Seeing him sigh in relief brings a nostalgic smile to my face.\n\n\n Master Benno had forgotten his dream, replacing it with a stubborn desire to protect his family and his shop. Ma?ne is pushing him into motion, making him form a paper makers’ association, making him get ready to start even more new ventures. Just like Otto had said before, Ma?ne, to Master Benno, is the goddess of water, bringing about the end of a long, long winter.\n\n\n And thanks to her, I have remembered my own dreams as well.\n\n\n If Ma?ne is his goddess of water, than I want to be, now more than ever, his god of fire, helping him grow and flourish."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n I’m Gunther. I’m thirty-two years old, and today I’m standing watch at the south gates to protect my beloved family.\n\n\n Otto is being extra annoying today. He just can’t stop himself from constantly grinning, and he isn’t actually doing his job at all. My guess is that something good’s happened to his wife, who he just adores. I get it, sure, but that face he’s making is just begging for a couple good punches.\n\n\n “Get yourself together, Otto. Is that the kind of face a gatekeeper makes?!”\n\n\n “I am keeping myself together!”\n\n\n When I call him out on it, he smacks himself in the cheeks, making an effort to shape up, but he barely manages anything. His cheeks are a little redder, but he can’t keep a straight face at all. As I sigh in astonishment, I hear a low chuckle behind me. I turn around and see my commanding officer, shoulders quivering with laughter.\n\n\n “Your subordinate’s just like you, isn’t he?” he says. “He’s paying exactly as much attention to his job as you do when you’re worried about your daughters.”\n\n\n “Ah…?! Uh, no, sir, what I―”\n\n\n He claps me on my shoulder. “Have a talk with him,” he says, sauntering off. “He always does it for you.”\n\n\n Back when I had to miss Tuuli’s baptismal ceremony, and whenever Ma?ne’s in trouble, Otto’s always been there to listen to me, so I guess I owe him one.\n\n\n Gotta do it, then. It’s not gonna be great, but maybe I should go keep him company after work. …Although, whenever he really gets started talking about things he loves, he gets completely unstoppable.\n\n\n I sigh again. Learning that that’s what people think of me was pretty unexpected, and I really had no way of knowing that everyone wanted us two irritatingly doting family men to be friends with each other, either.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n After we hand over our posts to the night shift, Otto and I start walking towards the eastern gates. The eastern gates are connected to the main highway, so it gets the most pedestrian traffic, and the road that connects to them is lined with inns and eateries. The side streets and alleys off the main road are packed with shops too, and these are the ones that the people who actually live here tend to use.\n\n\n Since it’s the summer, every single shop has its doors flung wide open, an here and there I can hear the rowdy voices of people enjoying a drink or four. We make our way towards a bar that’s a favorite among the soldiers here, taking care to avoid bumping into anyone else along the way.\n\n\n The bar is full of the smell of food and drink. When we walk in, the two medium-length tables in the middle of the room are full of a party of about ten or so people having a loud conversation about something or other. The handful of smaller, round tables around the edge of the room that are meant for a few people are also almost all full up.\n\n\n “It’s really busy,” remarks Otto.\n\n\n “C'mon, over there,” I say.\n\n\n I head towards the back of the room, cutting my way through the noisy party in the middle. On my way, I call out to the manager standing behind the counter.\n\n\n “Hey, Ebbo! Two bereas this way. And some boiled sausage too, when you get the chance.” “Comin’ up!”\n\n\n I put in an order for two bereas from Ebbo, the manager. To someone like me, who’s been a gatekeeper ever since his apprentice days, basically everyone in this little city’s an acquaintance, except for the nobles and rich people that keep the curtains closed on their carriages.\n\n\n I slap down a large copper coin on the counter to pay for the drinks and the sausage, and Ebbo sets out two large wooden mugs, filled to the brim with berea. I grab the mugs, careful not to spill anything, look around the room for an empty spot, and start moving towards a round table near the back of the bar.\n\n\n The table’s still got all the tableware on it from the previous customers, but when the two of us start heading for it a sharp-eyed serving girl quickly runs over to clear off the wooden cups and forks. There’s a piece of the bread that they serve meat on instead of plates left on the table, already damp with juice. She uses it to roughly wipe down the table, then tosses it to the ground. The shop dog runs over, tail wagging, and hungrily scarfs it down. Otto and I set our mugs down on the freshly cleared table and sit down, our chairs clattering against the wooden floor.\n\n\n “We give thanks to Vantolle,” we both say, lifting our mugs in gratitude to the god of alcohol, and take a drink.\n\n\n I down my entire mug in one go, gulping noisily. In my opinion, this is the absolute best way to enjoy a frothy mug of berea. The feeling of the drink pouring down my throat after it’s gotten so parched from work is irresistible. The sensation of the tiny little bubbles and that special bitter flavor hit my mouth an instant later.\n\n\n I let out a satisfied sigh. “That’s the stuff! …So, what’s happened?”\n\n\n I set my empty mug down on the table with a clack. Otto, who still has some froth around his mouth, takes a plate of boiled sausage from the serving girl and orders us another round. As I reach for the chunk of hard bread they served my sausage on, Otto starts acting absolutely lovestruck, foppishly shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\n “Wellll, Corinna says we’re still not telling anyone yet, so even if it’s you, sir, I just can’t say!”\n\n\n “What, you’re having a kid or something?”\n\n\n “H, how, how did you know that?!”\n\n\n “I mean, based on how you’re acting and the fact that your wife doesn’t want you to tell anyone, what else could it be?”\n\n\n Otto gives up, scratching his cheek. To be a little more honest, I figured it out after going through the exact same thing and having someone point it out the same way. No need to tell him that, though.\n\n\n Seriously, though, Otto’s going to be a dad, huh? Is this merry man really going to be okay?\n\n\n Those words flicker through my head, but even that was something that people asked about me back then, too.\n\n\n Yeah, if he’s so happy about having a child now, then he’ll probably be a good, doting father. Based on my own past, I’d bet there’ll be no problems there at all.\n\n\n “Alright, here’re your refills! Thanks for waiting.”\n\n\n The serving girl sets down fresh mugs with a heavy clack, their contents sloshing a little and sending a spray of foam over the sides. Neither she nor us customers pays it any mind, though, and I hand her a medium copper coin. Otto and I drink our drinks, distracted by the hubbub around us. Unlike my first mug, I don’t slam it back in one go, but instead let the complex flavor roll across my tongue, tasting the bitterness of the wheat mixed with the sweetness of the malt, before finally swallowing it down.\n\n\n Come to think of it, wasn’t Otto’s wife the seamstress that Eva and Tuuli admire? Tuuli was saying that after her darua contract runs out at her current workshop, she was going to try really hard to move to Otto’s wife’s workshop next. Also, her older brother’s the proprietor of that company that’s been taking care of Ma?ne. I myself only really know Otto, but it seems like our families have somehow managed to get pretty close.\n\n\n “Otto, make sure you do right by your wife and kid. Your kid’s going to be the heir to a major store, isn’t he? Ma?ne was saying something about that.”\n\n\n “…About that, sir.”\n\n\n His entire demeanor suddenly changes. His face hardens, his foppish demeanor disappearing, and he looks off into space as if he’s searching for words. When I see his shoulders tense, just like Ma?ne’s did when she was trying to tell us something she’d been bottling up, my head suddenly cools, the buzz of the alcohol disappearing. Despite the fact that I’d just taken a swig, my throat suddenly feels dry. I take a long, slow drink of my berea.\n\n\n “…Alright, what is it?”\n\n\n “Ah~… well, this isn’t an immediate thing, but… in a few years, I’m probably going to quit being a soldier.”\n\n\n The reason Otto had become a soldier was originally so that he could try to marry the heiress of a major store. A mere trader falling in love with the heiress of a major store. Basically everything about being a trader is different from being a merchant in a city. There’s no way a trader could suddenly become a merchant working for a major store. At that point, the people around her were saying that he was only courting her in order to gain the social standing of a major merchant, so she treated him with a lot of suspicion at first. However, when Otto bought his citizenship and found work as a soldier, not a merchant, it showed her how serious his feelings were.\n\n\n That was a major shock, though, when I heard about it. That happened when I was still stationed at the west gate, so that must have been, what, four years ago? One day, a particular trader, who’d always said that he was selling his wares so he could go home to his parents one day and open a shop in the city they lived in, came through the gates as usual. A few days later, that same trader shows back up again at the gates, saying that in order to woo a woman he’d sold everything he owned to buy a citizenship and was now looking for non-mercantile work. The other gatekeepers had to ask him to repeat himself several times, not believing their own ears.\n\n\n I’d known Otto since he was a kid, though, all the way back from when his father kept bringing him along his journeys as a trader. It was easy to understand that if a man like him who said that he was going to go back to his parents someday suddenly sold everything to buy citizenship, he must have seriously fallen in love at first sight.\n\n\n Thanks to his life as a trader, Otto knew his numbers, could read our official documents, and was decently good with his hands. In the end, I’d recommended him to the higher-ups in the guard, on the condition that he was mostly going to be doing paperwork. There are many soldiers who, no matter how diligent they are about training, constantly forget to do their paperwork. Otto joining the soldiery made dealing with the merchants and nobility coming through the gates with their letters of recommendation a lot easier on us all.\n\n\n But now he’s quitting being a soldier? Does this mean that his wife’s family has recognized him as a merchant?\n\n\n I’ve known for a while that when he’s not on duty at the gates, he’s been helping out with things at his wife’s shop. I also know that he’s been making sure to keep his mercantile senses sharp by talking with the traders and merchants that come through the gates. If this is the result of all of his hard work paying off, then I’m really happy for him, but there’s something in his face that reminds me of a man who’s lost his bearings.\n\n\n “So now that you’re having a kid, is that dutiful older brother of Corinna’s finally recognizing you?”\n\n\n “…No, we’ve occasionally had conversations about that before, so that’s probably not it. I think this is because of Ma?ne.”\n\n\n “What?!”\n\n\n I slam my cup down, eyes nearly flying out of my head. I hadn’t expected that my daughter’s name would come up at all. Otto, however, looks a little more relaxed, reaching for his cup and taking a drink.\n\n\n “Sir, when I was looking for work outside of being a merchant, the reason I thought being a soldier was the best choice for me was so that I could make acquaintances with the people living in this city. I wanted to make sure that I could remember everyone’s faces, and that they’d all remember mine. Also, I wanted to be able to know about all the merchants and nobles coming and going, so I decided that being a soldier would be a good way to gather a little intelligence.”\n\n\n “Hmm,” I say, noncommittally.\n\n\n “I’d planned to keep being a soldier for a while longer, but things around the store have started changing. The rinsham and hairpins that Ma?ne brought us have been extremely good products for us, so the Gilberta Company’s been achieving great things lately.”\n\n\n “Huh, because of the products Ma?ne brought you?”\n\n\n I’m happy that Ma?ne’s being praised, and as a parent I’m pretty proud about that, but something feels a bit off about all that. From where I’m standing, rinsham is something that Tuuli made, and the hairpins that Eva and Tuuli made were much prettier than Ma?ne’s. When Ma?ne tries to make things, she doesn’t have enough strength to do it, so she winds up making a whole lot of mistakes. I can’t even count all of the times I’ve seen her look at something that hasn’t turned out quite right with her head tilted to the side in confusion.\n\n\n “But the Gilberta Company’s main business is in clothing and accessories, so when she and Lutz made a vegetable-based paper and brought that to us… it’s very profitable and influential, but it doesn’t fit the direction of our store. Benno wants to expand the scope of what we sell. Corinna, though, really doesn’t have any interest in anything but clothing, so she’s been saying that she doesn’t want to do any expansion.”\n\n\n I frown. “Are you telling me that Ma?ne bringing you things has been causing conflict?”\n\n\n Otto frantically waves his hand back and forth. “Oh no no no, I wouldn’t call it conflict at all. From a merchant’s standpoint, all those things are amazing. I totally understand why Benno wants to get involved. It’s just that Corinna doesn’t want to sell them. That’s why Benno’s thinking that he wants to hand over the Gilberta Company to Corinna earlier than we’d planned, get me to help, and own his own shop… He’s going to start a new shop in order to sell the things that Ma?ne comes up with to other cities.”\n\n\n If the proprietor of a major store is going all the way as to start a new store, then selling and distributing these products must be generating colossal sums of money. A little while ago, an extremely excited Tuuli had been trying very hard to explain to me that Ma?ne was actually extremely rich, but I figured, reasonably, that she was just exaggerating. There’s no way that a girl just barely out of her baptism would have any real amount of money.\n\n\n “…So it’s true, then, that Ma?ne’s been earning a ridiculous amount of money?”\n\n\n “It really is. But, she’s been extremely careful about controlling her finances. Maybe someone taught her about that, because she’s far better at it than you’d expect a kid to be. I don’t think you’d have managed to teach her how to calculate transactions at that level, sir, so where in the world did she learn it?”\n\n\n He grins teasingly at me. I stare back at him for a moment, then snort. There’s only one being that could have taken notice of my cute little girl, filled her to overflowing with mana, and gifted her with knowledge beyond understanding.\n\n\n “The gods taught it to her. My daughter is beloved by the gods, after all.”\n\n\n “I kept thinking you were just exaggerating like a normal father, but it’s kinda scary how persuasive that idea is now.”\n\n\n Otto laughs, shrugging his shoulders, then takes a big bite of his sausage. I take a bite of my own, then turn the conversation back to him.\n\n\n “So, when are you planning on quitting? We don’t have anyone able to take over for your work, you know?”\n\n\n “Oh, yes, there’s no way that I’d be able to hand off my post anytime soon, so I was thinking that it would be sometime in the next two to three years. I’ve been thinking I want to train up someone to be good at calculations, though.” He sighs. “Ahh… Ma?ne getting caught by the temple was a miscalculation on my part.”\n\n\n I recall that Otto had advised Ma?ne to not become a merchant’s apprentice, trying to convince her that both her physical weakness and the strain she’d put on human relationships meant that it would be better for her to work out of her home. What she decided back then was that she was going to work at home, sometimes come along with me to the gates to do some work there, and keep living like that for as long as she could, wasn’t it? I don’t think anyone was thinking that she might get caught up by the temple.\n\n\n “It was a miscalculation for me too, I guess. Ma?ne had been saying that she didn’t want to make any noble’s acquaintance, then suddenly she started saying she wanted to go apprentice as a priestess. Just to read books whenever she wanted, huh, that girl…”\n\n\n Just remembering the time when she’d told me that she wanted to go to the temple and be a priestess makes my grip tighten painfully on the mug.\n\n\n “It seems like Benno had been gathering information and trying to pull some strings, but… Sir, are you happy with the way things turned out?”\n\n\n “Do you think I am?” I say, shooting him a sharp look.\n\n\n He raises his hands in defeat, shaking his head. “No, not at all.”\n\n\n No matter how many good conditions we got, Ma?ne attending the temple isn’t anything I would have picked by choice.\n\n\n “I don’t think I possibly could be happy about that,” I say. “They’re promising that she’s going to be treated the same way that the nobles are, but once you start thinking about those guys’ sense of privilege, there’s no way that that’s actually going to wind up happening.”\n\n\n “…Yes, exactly.”\n\n\n It’s just lip service. Sure, to make it look good, they’ll probably give her some blue robs, but I know for a fact that they’re not going to treat her the same as a noble in any meaningful way.\n\n\n “Although, we did manage to avoid getting her thrown in the orphanage. If she can come home, then I still get to see her. Those guys are nobles. Even if all we got out of this was that she didn’t get completely snatched away by them, then that’s still a win in my book.”\n\n\n “It’s a very precarious position, though.”\n\n\n “…Yeah.”\n\n\n Ma?ne’s magic had gone berserk, coercing the temple master into backing down, so things are somewhat hazy right now, but he was originally planning on sentencing me and Eva to death and throwing Ma?ne into the orphanage. She saved our lives, and we won her the ability to live at home, but that was an enormous concession on the temple’s part. Wishing for any better treatment than that is futile. Rather, the temple master is going to be livid that he was coerced by a mere commoner, and is absolutely going to treat her terribly. Just thinking of what might happen once she starts going to the temple fills me with dread.\n\n\n “Sir. This is second-hand information, but according to Benno, Ma?ne has at most five years of relative peace at the temple. Since there aren’t that many nobles around right now, people that have mana are very important, but once their numbers start to increase then there’s a very real danger that they’re going to treat her as a burden.”\n\n\n “…Just five years, huh? It’s still better than the alternative, though. If she doesn’t go to the temple, then it won’t even be half a year from now before she dies.”\n\n\n I’m letting Ma?ne go to the temple for the sake of prolonging her life. That is all I can do for her. If I had magic tools, I could do it myself, but I don’t have either the connections or the money to be able to get any. I’m too worthless as a father.\n\n\n “If she can’t go to the temple, then making a contract with a nobleman would be fine, too. She has a lot of value: she has mana, and she can make money. If she can demonstrate how valuable she is before things start getting dangerous, then there’s a good chance that she’ll be able to secure better conditions on the contract than just being kept alive.”\n\n\n “Ma?ne said that she wanted to stay with her family, so she didn’t want a contract with a noble, but… as her father, I think I’d prefer her to keep living.”\n\n\n She suffered with her fever for so long, but now that she’s finally able to do the things that she wants to be able to do, I want her to live for the sake of her dreams. But, does her wish to live extend all the way to making a contract with a noble? What kind of noble would she contract with, and what conditions would she be able to get on that contract? Everything is all up to Ma?ne.\n\n\n I’m her father, yet there’s so little I can do. Benno consulted with his relatives to gather all sorts of information for her. The guild master sold her one of the magical tools he’d gathered for his own granddaughter’s sake. I can’t help but wonder if they’ve done so much more for her than I ever could.\n\n\n “…Just what can I do for her, as her father? I don’t have money, I don’t have connections. No matter how important she is to me, in the end, I’m just a soldier that can’t even protect his own daughter, aren’t I? I’m just a bad joke.”\n\n\n I let the alcohol do its work, letting out the feelings I can’t ever let out at home. I’ve been so self-importantly declaring that I’d protect all of the families of this town, when there’s nothing I can really even do for them.\n\n\n Otto slowly tilts his head doubtfully to one side as he listens to me grumble.\n\n\n “No, I’d say that you, the soldier who guards the gates to this city, are the gods’ baton of command.”\n\n\n I narrow my eyes. “…What do you mean by that?”\n\n\n Otto glances around the room, which still roils with noisy activity, then leans a little closer, lowering his voice.\n\n\n “Thanks to Benno’s assistance, Ma?ne is more-or-less well-protected within the city by a magical contract. At the very least, there’s plenty of people here in the city who want to keep Ma?ne safe. Out of all of Benno’s predictions, though, the one that we should be most scared of is the possibility that Ma?ne might be kidnapped by a noble from somewhere else.”\n\n\n I gulp. “What happens if she’s kidnapped?”\n\n\n I’ve been mostly assuming that the danger was going to come from the nobles in the temple. I hadn’t even considered that nobles from other parts of the country might have their eyes on her too.\n\n\n “If she leaves the city, she’ll be cut off from the contract magic’s effects. If nobles from this city do anything, and someone like the guild master or Benno decide to do something about it, then they might be able to appeal to the lord of the city to investigate the matter. However, if the nobles are from another city, then there’s a possibility that they’d be out of the lord’s reach.”\n\n\n Benno is the proprietor of a major shop, and it’s plain to see that he has a lot of political power. Hearing that someone like him, or the master of the merchant’s guild, or even the lord of the city himself have limits to where they can actually exercise that power hits me like a blow to the head.\n\n\n If the lord of the city can’t do something, then how could I possibly do it either? How in the world do I deal with nobles from another city?\n\n\n I squeeze my forehead tightly, fingers digging into my temples. Otto, though, gives me a broad, challenging grin.\n\n\n “If we don’t want that to happen, then we’re going to want to find out this of the priests in the temple has ill feelings towards Ma?ne and do some investigation into what nobles those people might have relationships with. Also, we’ll need to keep an eye out for any nobles from other places who come to the city, then decide if they’re trouble or not. Since that’s the case, then wouldn’t you think that the gatekeeper’s job of reading every single letter of introduction and written invitation that people bring with them is, in fact, a very suitable job for keeping Ma?ne safe?”\n\n\n I blink several times, thinking back on what a gatekeeper’s job is. He’s right in that if you want to know about the movement of the nobility, being a gatekeeper is an excellent way to do so. No noble from other cities ever comes through our gates without either a letter of introduction or a written invitation. Whether by horse or carriage, nobles who enter the city always pass through the gates, then based on their letter of introduction, head straight to the inner ramparts and enter the nobles’ quarter. Distinguished noblemen never ordinarily wander around the districts where us commoners live. If we’re alert for any noble stopping their carriages in the city or heading straight for the temple, then there’s a good chance that we’d be able to head off any kidnapping attempt.\n\n\n Even if, for example, a nobleman were to hire some thug to do the kidnapping for her, any gatekeeper on duty would instantly recognize them as a stranger. We can pretty easily spot anyone who makes their living doing shady business, too. If I talk to the people here as I make my rounds, asking them if they’ve seen anything suspicious, and get closer to my fellow guards, then I could, just by my every day actions, put myself in a position where I can find out very quickly if something strange is going on. This is entirely part of my job as a soldier.\n\n\n “Sir, weren’t you the one who said that you became a soldier to protect all the families of the city? Ma?ne counts. I think that if you just keep doing what you’ve always been doing, you can protect her.”\n\n\n “Now that I think of it, I think starting next spring we’re going to be reassigned to the eastern gates. That might be some good luck.”\n\n\n Every three years, squads are rotated between the gates. That’s probably in place to stop things from getting in a rut, help deepen the bonds between all the soldiers, and make sure the work winds up being the same everywhere, but I don’t really care too much about the actual details. All I care about is the fact that this upcoming spring, my squad is going to be reassigned to the eastern gates. Those gates face the highway, so they have the highest amount of traffic out of all of the gates, and it’ll be the easiest place to get information from. It’s the gate through which the largest number of strangers come through, so it’ll be the place where I’ll need to be the most vigilant.\n\n\n “You’ll need to be on your guard, and don’t let anything slip by when you’re gathering information,” says Otto. “I think it would be a good idea for you to figure out how you can use your connections with the other soldiers, and go over how they can get in contact with you so that you can start moving as soon as even the littlest strange thing happens. I’ll help, too. After all, Benno’s sticking his nose into all sorts of things these days, so it’s not like this doesn’t affect my family either.”\n\n\n With a defiant grin, he makes a fist and flexes his bicep, bending his elbow, making the sign we soldiers use to wish each other a good fight.\n\n\n “Sir. Let’s definitely keep her safe.”\n\n\n I return his grin and down the last of my berea, washing the last of my melancholy away. My cup clacks against the table as I set it down. I clench my fist and bend my elbow, then tap my fist lightly against Otto’s.\n\n\n “Yeah. My family’s one of this city’s families, so I’ll protect them too.”\n\n\n END OF BOOK ONE"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Book 2: The Apprentice Shrine Maiden\n\n\n My name is Ferdinand. I serve as the head priest of the temple of the city of Ehrenfest. People frequently mistake me as being between twenty-five or, if I’m unlucky, thirty years old, but in reality I am twenty. My half brother often comments that I was not blessed with enough youthfulness and it has already run dry, but this is, in truth, a product of my living environment.\n\n\n All the way through my coming-of-age, I was part of noble society. I was the son of a concubine, but because I had just enough mana to contribute to the foundational magical tools and because (although this may be a little self-aggrandizing to say) the pursuit of knowledge posed no difficulty to me, my half brother, who is older than me, had me raised to serve as his assistant. Regardless of my father’s true wife, my relationship with my half brother was not at all bad.\n\n\n However, my father’s wife seemed to be displeased with the fact that I was serving as my half brother’s assistant, so, after my father’s death, she began treating me with open hostility. Several politically powerful adults supported her viewpoint, and I could not rely on my biological mother, and I began to fear for my own safety. At that time, my half brother recommended to me that I should join the temple.\n\n\n To those in noble society, joining the temple is effectively a declaration that you are withdrawing from the world of politics. However, even at the temple mana must still be used to perform divine miracles, so there are still close ties to the world of noble politics. Also, because the higher-ranked priests and priestesses all originate from the nobility, there still exists a strict hierarchy based on social standing.\n\n\n My half brother grinned as he told me to aim for the absolute top and take control of the temple from the inside. I, however, knew that was far easier said than done, as the current temple master is a man related to my father’s true wife’s family and his behavior could be extremely dangerous to me, so I just shrugged as I made my way into the temple.\n\n\n My days at the temple were peaceful. There were people in charge of the temple’s finances, of managing the orphanage, of making contact with the nobility, and so on, but that work never came around to me. As such, I had no real work beyond the work of maintaining the ritual tools, and found myself with an overwhelming abundance of free time.\n\n\n Because I had so much time, I reached out to my half brother and asked him to send over books and wooden tablets from our home. I used them in order to build a library, one that even nobles with unfortunate economic circumstances would be able to use. However, the blue-garbed priests and priestesses at the temple were all people who were incapable of returning to noble society, so none of them had any interest in the pursuit of knowledge. The deplorable fact of the matter is that the only person who showed any interest in it whatsoever was a single commoner girl, who wanted to read so badly that she fell to the ground weeping.\n\n\n Then, a coup happened in Central, and the ranks of the nobility were thinned out. What first happened to us is that our apprentices who were still young enough to be sent to the House of Lords were, one by one, called back home. Then, the priests and priestesses who were still of marriageable age were called back into noble society. Finally, a demand came from the temple in Central for all priests and priestesses possessing a particular degree of magical power to make their way there.\n\n\n Now, there are no priestesses left in the temple, and the only priests left are those who are too old to return home and who possess not enough mana to be considered useful by the temple in Central. All of the people who were primarily in charge of managing the temple’s affairs had been called away, leaving me to take on every single aspect of running the temple. My easy, peaceful days have vanished without a trace. Because of the scope and importance of my work, the stature of my family, and the supplication of my half brother, I became the head priest, despite the fact that it had not been terribly long since I joined the temple and that I was still very young.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Father, the temple master is calling for you.”\n\n\n “…It seems he’s alright, then.”\n\n\n When Fran, my attendant, informs me of this, I stand, sighing. As I leave my room and head towards the temple master’s chambers, I lament to myself that, if only the temple master could have been laid out a little longer, I could have gotten a little more work done. Reverend B?sewanz is a man who never assists me in my work, but is forceful in giving his opinions, so I am thankful for every moment that he sleeps while I am performing my duties.\n\n\n As I make my way through the halls, the library room passes through my field of view. The face of Ma?ne, the child who ignited such chaos in order to read the books here, floats through my memory, and I reach up to massage my temples. She is the source of all of my most recent headaches, and it is likely that she is the reason the temple master is calling me to him this time.\n\n\n During the baptismal ceremonies, Ma?ne discovered the library and declared that she wished to become a sister-in-training. At the time, she wore clothing that made her appear to be the daughter of a wealthy family. In order to secure her apprenticeship, she offered an enormous sum of money as a donation. The temple master, dazzled by the sheer amount of coin, met with her to discuss the matter of having the daughter of a wealthy family join the temple. When this happened, it was revealed to us that she possessed mana.\n\n\n Based on her reactions when she was reading the scriptures, it was clear to me that she was quite intelligent, and from her demeanor and polite manner of speech, I could easily guess that she had had an excellent education. As such, when the temple master suggested that she be granted a blue robe when she joined the temple, I could not disagree.\n\n\n However, when her parents were called out to the temple in order to discuss the matter further, it became apparent that Ma?ne was not the daughter of a wealthy family, but instead the daughter of commoners.\n\n\n To my sensibilities, it did not matter whose daughter she was. Provided she brought her donation and possessed mana, there was no problem at all. Reverend B?sewanz, however, thought differently. He adopted an openly aggressive demeanor towards the three of them, angering Ma?ne in the process.\n\n\n If she were a noble, she would have had magical tools to help her manage her mana. Or, in other words, she would have offered her mana to magical tools at regular intervals, so even in the event that her emotions were to stir her mana into motion, it would not have run rampant. However, Ma?ne was a commoner, and as such had no access to magical tools.\n\n\n Of course, when her mana did run rampant and escaped from her body, it was directed entirely at Reverend B?sewanz. Her mana was far stronger than could possibly have been expected from a girl who managed to survive the devouring all the way through her baptismal ceremonies. The reverend, taking the full force of Ma?ne’s magical coercion, fainted on the spot and did not regain consciousness for some time. As he slept, I made use of the excellent opportunity to have a conversation with Ma?ne’s parents directly and was able to come to an arrangement with them.\n\n\n Although the temple master has only just regained consciousness and is still resting, he made the express effort to summon me. Most likely, he wishes to confirm how the discussion with Ma?ne had turned out and, of course, voice his complaints. It’s easy for me to imagine all of the many complaints that might fly from his mouth.\n\n\n The figure of the attendant standing next to the door comes into view as I approach. It’s not my place to say it, but it might be good for the temple master, the most important man in the temple, to stand up himself every once in a while. I take in a long, slow breath, and as I let it out I let my irritation out with it.\n\n\n “Reverend, Father Ferdinand has arrived.”\n\n\n The attendant opens the door for me, matched perfectly with my walking speed so that it opens exactly as I arrive. From the slight tension I see on his face, I wonder if he might be a newcomer. When I enter, I see that the temple master is sitting at his work desk, slumping heavily into the back of his chair. It is a pose that highlights his protruding belly.\n\n\n If one were to think solely of our families’ relative positions in noble society, I would be more highly ranked than he is, but I am an illegitimate son, while he is legitimate. And, as he is a member of the extended family of the mother of my half brother, the standing of his house is not at all insignificant. As such, since he cannot help but to show his superiority over me, whenever he calls me to see him, without fail he will always be sitting at his work desk, leaving me to stand as he smirks at me.\n\n\n However, today he does not have the emotional leeway to even smirk at me. His expression is fiendish, his brows so tightly knit that deep bumps cross the bridge of his nose, and he drums his fingers hard against the surface of his desk in clear irritation. The instant he sees me, he vigorously starts to speak.\n\n\n “Father Ferdinand,” he says, “what happened to that thing?”\n\n\n I leisurely make my way over to him then, with careful emphasis on the grace a nobleman should comport himself with, tilt my head slightly to one side.\n\n\n “To what thing are you referring?”\n\n\n “What else?” he yells. “That unbelievably impertinent little child!”\n\n\n Like a child throwing a tantrum, he sits up straight, slamming his fist into the surface of his desk. This falls entirely within my expectations, so I have long since raised the wooden tablet on which I had brought my report, pretending to read it while actually using it as a shield to protect my face from his flying spittle.\n\n\n “Ahh, of course… I believe her name was Ma?ne.”\n\n\n “That’s right. You sent her away, right?”\n\n\n He glares at me with wide eyes, but I just slowly shake my head.\n\n\n “I fully understand your displeasure, Reverend, but the temple is facing a serious shortage of mana. You must be very aware of this yourself, seeing as you had been trying to get her to join the temple. This will only be a problem until the number of nobles in this city has increased again.”\n\n\n “Ferdinand, are you telling me to be patient? Me, the master of this temple…”\n\n\n Before he can launch into his usual long, long tirade about his parentage and position, I launch into an outline of the current status of the temple.\n\n\n “If we do not have her, then our dedication ceremonies will almost certainly be fraught with difficulty. And then, when autumn comes… And what if a request for us comes from the knights’ order? Would you be willing to say that we don’t have enough mana and cannot help them? Or, would you be willing to have to constantly ask for help from other temples until the number of nobles here rises again?”\n\n\n The temple master’s social stature is high and, proportionally, his own sense of self-conceitedness is high as well. I know full well that a man like that would never be able to bow his head to another human being. It seems that my words found their mark, as the temple master starts to turn bright red, perhaps imagining himself having to beg other temples for assistance.\n\n\n “Tch, if we didn’t have a mana shortage, I’d have that impertinent girl executed immediately…”\n\n\n “Provoking her to her face is quite dangerous, Reverend. If you are on the receiving end of that much mana again, your heart might not be able to withstand it.”\n\n\n I wonder if he has forgotten that it was his heavy-handed behavior towards Ma?ne that caused her to use her magical coercion on him until he fainted? This is the problem with old people.\n\n\n Reverend B?sewanz audibly grinds his teeth together. As a mild diversion, I decide to bring up the topic of the discussion I had had with Ma?ne’s parents and the agreements that we had come to.\n\n\n “As the two of us had discussed prior to the meeting, it was ultimately agreed that we would provide Ma?ne with a special set of blue robes. Her parents also agreed to our other proposal that she be assigned to not only maintain the magical tools, but also to be given work in the library room as she herself had asked for. This is all as we had planned beforehand.”\n\n\n I make very sure to hammer in multiple times that these were points that the temple master and I had agreed on beforehand. This may be due to his age, but he has lately been prone to forgetting the contents of conversations he was part of, whenever it seems to suit him. And, perhaps because he forgot everything just as I expected, he sits there glaring at me, with an extremely unwilling expression, like he wanted so badly to object but was unable to.\n\n\n “Grrrr…”\n\n\n “Ahh, and then, we agreed that Ma?ne would not live in the orphanage, but instead be able to commute between her home and the temple. Since there are already many nobles here who have homes that they return to, I did not judge this to be particularly problematic, and gave it my approval.”\n\n\n “What did you say?!”\n\n\n The temple master’s eyes fly open wide as he snaps at me. This, too, is well within my expectations.\n\n\n “…I believe that allowing her to live at home would be preferable to having her demand that since she has been given blue robes she should be given a room in the parts of the temple reserved for the nobility. Do you not agree?”\n\n\n “Hmph! Well, you’re right in that.”\n\n\n The choice between giving her a noble’s room and letting her live at home seems easy for the temple master to understand, so he gives me a very unpleasant smile as he nods in approval. It seems that he’s already forgotten his own declaration that he wouldn’t think twice about throwing her into the orphanage, but since he has just agreed, Ma?ne’s ability to commute has been established.\n\n\n “In addition, because Ma?ne is very frail, it seems that she may be unable to perform her duties every day, but since there is ultimately not a tremendous amount of work for a blue-robed sister-in-training to do, I believe that it should not be a problem for her to rest when she is not feeling well.”\n\n\n “Hah, what an unmotivated little girl.”\n\n\n It seems like he will not be satisfied if he doesn’t find some way to complain about every single thing. He appears to understand, though, so I merely shrug my shoulders and continue.\n\n\n “I merely judged that doing so would be preferable to her falling ill while at the temple. …On that note, we also agreed that Ma?ne, in order to manage her condition, would be assigned attendants.”\n\n\n “That’s unnecessary!”\n\n\n Reverend B?sewanz’s objection was very much within my expectations, so I simply breathe a small sigh, then deliver yet another rehearsed answer.\n\n\n “If someone from outside the temple were to see a blue-robed priestess without any attendants, it would only reflect poorly on the temple and, in turn, I believe it would reflect poorly on you. …Besides, as of now we have an excess of gray-robed priests and priestesses. Do you not think that it would be a good idea to simply assign some of those to Ma?ne?”\n\n\n “…I see.”\n\n\n Although the blue-robed clergy has left, the gray-robed priests and priestesses have largely been left behind, save for those few who were the favorites of any individuals who were being called away. Given that the donations to the temple from the families of blue-robed priests have diminished, the ever-accumulating expenses of the largely masterless gray-robed clergy are nothing but a problem for the temple.\n\n\n “Next, according to my investigations into Ma?ne, it seems that she has been registered with the merchant’s guild as the manager of a workshop. It would have been quite simple to be able to tell her that those working in the service of the gods have no need to make money, but I believe that if we can regularly acquire some of the profit from the workshop for ourselves, it would be quite beneficial to the temple. What do you think?”\n\n\n “Wring her dry.”\n\n\n “As you wish.”\n\n\n As the size of the clergy has decreased so much, the amount of money that the temple can earn on its own has diminished. To Reverend B?sewanz, this money is far more useful than the public doctrine of the temple. With this, I have finally gotten his approval on all of the points I had come to an agreement on with Ma?ne’s family. I breathe a sigh of relief.\n\n\n “For the time being, in order to avoid causing you any trouble, I plan to personally see to handling all of the burden Ma?ne will bring. If the merchant’s guild is going to be involved, I believe I should be able to handle the additional paperwork. Also, I shall ensure that she never shows her face in this room. Then… ah, yes. When selecting the gray-robed priests to be her attendants, I will assign one of my own attendants to her as well, so that we can receive detailed reports on her activities.”\n\n\n A light glimmers in the temple master’s eyes, as if he’s found something interesting in the idea of being vigilant about Ma?ne. He thoughtfully strokes his white beard, smiling that unpleasant smile that he gets whenever he cooks up another worthless scheme.\n\n\n “Hmm? …In that case, perhaps I should assign someone to her as well? Even that girl should confide in another girl around her age. Delia, I think, would work hard for my sake. And for the others, let’s give her the most troublesome kids we can dig out of the orphanage. Inconvenience her as much as humanly possible. Squeeze every last drop of donation that we can get out of her. After all, there’s nothing else that that… thing is good for.” \n\n “As you wish.”\n\n\n This became something problematic. Ma?ne is unfamiliar with the details of noble society and the workings of the temple, so I had planned to assign to her an assistant who could help her navigate both of those things, but if the temple master’s protege is assigned to be her attendant as well, then my own actions will wind up being brought to the temple master’s attention as well.\n\n\n I weave my fingers together in front of me, thanking him, then leave his room. Bitter regrets plague me as I return to my own room.\n\n\n “Good grief…”\n\n\n What a profoundly troublesome temple master. The blue-robed priests and priestesses given to the custody of the temple are largely illegitimate children. Amongst such company, he, a legitimate son from an influential family, finds much to boast about. In truth, he has comparatively very little mana, so he has a terrifyingly powerful inferiority complex towards those given to the temple who have more than he does.\n\n\n If we are not careful with our behavior towards Ma?ne, there is a good possibility that he may cause her to run rampant again. Besides the fact that her social standing is even lower than mine, she brings with her not just mana and coin, but an aptitude for writing reports and handling paperwork, so to me, she is a far more capable person than Reverend B?sewanz.\n\n\n I look over the report on Ma?ne, and my eyes find their way to the section on her commercial dealings. With the backing of the Gilberta Company, she was registered with the guild under a provisional apprentice’s license. The products that she has transferred rights to up to this point are “rinsham”, a vegetable-based paper, hair ornaments made by knitting thread, “pound cake” and many variations thereof. It would seem that she, as an individual, commands sizable financial assets, to the point where her declaration that she could afford to donate a large gold coin was no exaggeration.\n\n\n Due to concerns with her physical condition, she abandoned her path towards becoming an apprentice, and instead plans to use Ma?ne’s Workshop, set up for her by the Gilberta Company, to continue to profit from the goods she invents.\n\n\n “To make this many contracts for new products within just one year… she seems to just think of one invention after the other.”\n\n\n It seems that the goods Ma?ne’s Workshop will produce will generate spectacularly large amounts of profit. I must ensure that I assign an attendant to her who will be capable of making very detailed reports to me, if we are to avoid being deceived by any greedy merchants.\n\n\n As I consider that thought, I look around at the attendants currently stationed in my room. Now then, who must I assign to be Ma?ne’s attendant? I will need someone deeply loyal to me, capable of making accurate reports, and very patient, I think. They will, after all, need to be able to flawlessly handle the trouble that the temple master’s chosen attendant will cause.\n\n\n “…Fran.”\n\n\n “Yes, Father, how may I assist you?”\n\n\n Upon hearing his name, he smoothly steps closer to me.\n\n\n “I will have you become Ma?ne’s attendant. I would like you to provide me with reports on her actions, as detailed as you possibly can. Additionally, please ensure, to the best of your ability, that she does not cross paths with Reverend B?sewanz.”\n\n\n “Um?! ……Very well, Father.”\n\n\n For an instant, a discontented frown flashes across his features, but then he nods slowly in agreement. Fran had been present when Ma?ne’s mana went out of control, so it’s possible that the image of the temple master fainting flashed across his mind.\n\n\n “Her other attendant should be… Ah, yes. Do we have anyone who is particularly difficult to handle, to the point where they would be a poor fit to be assigned to a noble? We must, after all, at the very least appear to take the reverend’s opinion into consideration.”\n\n\n A look of bewilderment enters Fran’s eyes as he glances nervously around the room. After a moment, he lowers his gaze. Arnaud, who had waited on me as I went to Reverend B?sewanz’s room, speaks up, coming to his rescue.\n\n\n “Ah, I see. How about Gil? He is frequently sent to the meditation room, but never seems to learn. He very much troubles the managing priest.”\n\n\n “…Hm. Then, let’s have Gil, Delia, and Fran be Ma?ne’s attendants.”\n\n\n It has been decided who Ma?ne’s attendants shall be. It will take her blue robes another three days to arrive, and Ma?ne’s apprenticeship is set to start in five days.\n\n\n All of the preparations for Ma?ne’s arrival are very much in order, but I wonder just what might happen next?\n\n\n Although at this point I was able to imagine that Ma?ne might stir up strife with her arrival, I had not even the slightest idea of just how much chaos she would incite."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Starting today, I’m going to be an apprentice priestess.\n\n\n They told me that it would take a few days to prepare a set of blue robes for me, so my start date is nearly a month later than Lutz’s, even though we got baptized on the same day. I couldn’t help but be impatient to go, so it was only inevitable that I felt that the days until I could go to the temple felt very long.\n\n\n Although, even though I say that they felt long, I didn’t actually have all that much free time to spend. I went with Tuuli to Corinna’s house a few times to teach her how to make hairpins, and there was the pound cake tasting party too. Benno got riled up by Ilse during that party and swept me up in his rampage, so I went on a field trip to a bread workshop and even got to participate in the preliminary investigations into the workers that we wanted to hire away. Of course, I wound up overexerting myself, so the last few days I wound up stuck in bed with a fever again.\n\n\n I was kept busy with so many different things, but to me all that time was just keeping me from the library room, so to me it felt like forever, every day feeling like a thousand years. However, today that long wait has come to an end.\n\n\n I finally, finally get to read books! And they’re those chained-up books, too, you know? Aaah, just thinking about it is getting me really excited!\n\n\n “Ma?ne, Lutz is here for you.”\n\n\n As I twirl merrily around the room, Tuuli walks in, stops, looks at me in amazement, then shrugs.\n\n\n “Thanks, Tuuli. I’m heading off!”\n\n\n “Ma?ne, be careful not to get too excited!”\n\n\n As if! I yell in my heart, leaping out the door.\n\n\n Since the temple is in the north part of town, I’m wearing the nicest set of clothing that I own: my apprentice robes from the Gilberta Company. This will work for me until I get the blue robes that’ll be my priestly uniform.\n\n\n “Hm hm hmmm, hm hmm~…”\n\n\n I skip down the street, humming merrily. Lutz grabs my arm to stop me, scowling at me.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you’re acting a little too happy. Your fever’s gonna come back before you even get to the temple.”\n\n\n “Urgh… that wouldn’t be good.”\n\n\n I force my feet to stop skipping on their own, cursing my body for being so frail that I can’t even skip happily down a street. I squash down every instinct I have to speed up, even just a little bit. Taking Lutz’s hand, I walk, slowly, towards the temple.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, are you really going to be okay today?”\n\n\n “All I’m doing today is getting my robes and meeting the attendants they’re assigning me, so it’ll be fine, trust me.”\n\n\n It turns out that my work days largely wound up overlapping with Lutz’s. Both my family and Benno decided that it would be best for Lutz to stick with me like he’s always done, at least until the attendants that’ll be with me at the temple know how to keep a handle on my physical condition.\n\n\n I think it might be impossible for someone to be able to judge my condition as well as Lutz can, though, no matter how much time passes…\n\n\n I wonder if maybe they want Lutz to stick with me forever? It started with my family, but even Benno, Mark, and Lutz are all extremely wary of the nobles at the temple. If I’m always depending on Lutz, though, then I’m still just going to be weighing him down, which would make me giving up on being a merchant’s apprentice basically pointless. When I tried explaining my objections to Benno, he just snorted, which prompted Mark to give me a vague sort of laugh and, with a troubled look on his face, explain a few things to me.\n\n\n It looks like Lutz is getting a lot of coaching directly from Mark so that he can help out with opening the new Italian restaurant and establishing paper-making workshops in other towns too. Since he’s the primary point of contact with me, the original inventor of these ideas, it’s a very different curriculum compared to what the other apprentices get.\n\n\n Since Lutz is going to be involved in these new businesses from the start, said Mark, he needs to very quickly put the things he learns into practice, so everything he needs to know for work is getting drilled into him very quickly. When I heard this, I thoughtlessly objected, insisting that that’s not new-hire training at all, but it turns out that Lutz himself is very enthusiastic about the whole thing, because it means that he gets to go visit other towns far earlier than he’d been anticipating.\n\n\n If it makes him happy, then that’s all right. Good luck, Lutz!\n\n\n We arrive at the temple, where a lone gray-robed priest stands waiting for us by the gate. When the relatively well-built man sees me approach, he immediately bows to me, crossing both of his hands over his chest.\n\n\n “Good morning, Miss Ma?ne. I am here to guide you to the head priest.”\n\n\n “Miss Ma?ne!? Pff, ahahaha! Seriously?”\n\n\n The polite way that the gray-robed priest had addressed me caused Lutz to burst into laughter. He glances between me and the priest, cackling. I notice the priest’s eyebrows twitch in a brief look of discomfort, so I frantically start pushing Lutz, who is clutching his sides, back in the direction of Benno’s shop.\n\n\n “Don’t laugh, Lutz!”\n\n\n “Ahhh, sorry, sorry. I’ll be back by fourth bell to pick you up, so wait here for me, okay?”\n\n\n “Okay! I’ll be here.”\n\n\n I wave goodbye, then after just a little bit of seeing him off, I turn around to face the gray-robed priest.\n\n\n “I’m very sorry if my friend caused you any discomfort.”\n\n\n He casts his eyes downward. “…There is no need for you to apologize to me, ma'am. Leaving that aside, Father Ferdinand is waiting for you.”\n\n\n As I stand there, shocked at how he turned down my apology, he turns his back on me and starts walking into the temple. The clicking of his wooden shoes on the smooth white stone resounds through the temple. I hurry after him, making no other sound than that of my own footsteps as a heavy feeling of restraint settles over me.\n\n\n We turn a corner in the hallway, and I start hearing noises other than just our footsteps. I glance up, looking for the source of the noise, and see a handful of gray-robed priestesses sweeping the hallways. I’d seen a few gray-robed priestesses during the baptismal ceremony, but these women don’t seem to be as clean as the ones I’d seen back then. It’s not just because they’re in the middle of sweeping or that their robes have gotten a little bit dirty. Maybe it’s a reflection on how frequently they bathe, or how much effort they put into their personal appearance, but when compared to the priest I’m walking behind, they have an entirely different atmosphere about them.\n\n\n As each priestess and apprentice looks up, one by one, and notices the priest’s approach, they stop sweeping and line up against the sides of the corridor, looking demurely downward.\n\n\n Are they maybe showing deference here?\n\n\n Since I’m so small, I’m effectively hidden by the gray-robed priest as we walk. Judging by how a few of the priestesses looked shocked to see me behind him, I’m pretty sure their behavior wasn’t directed at me. The sudden realization that there’s a strict hierarchy amongst even the orphans that make up the gray-robed priesthood leaves me completely filled with unease at how absolutely different the world I’ve just stepped into is compared to what I’m used to.\n\n\n Until now, my daily life hasn’t really been affected by any nobility. I’ve basically spent my entire life interacting with people who are like me. Even when I’ve met with wealthy merchants, the quality of the goods that I brought with me meant that I still got treated more-or-less as an equal.\n\n\n Am I really going to be okay here? I don’t understand anything about hierarchical societies. I’m going to make some seriously massive blunder, aren’t I?\n\n\n As we pass through the richly-appointed, empty hallways, our footsteps are the only thing that breaks the deafening silence. I feel like the world that I’ve stepped into is something that, even with everything I learned as Urano, is far beyond my wildest imaginings.\n\n\n “Father Ferdinand, Miss Ma?ne has arrived.”\n\n\n Hearing myself referred to as “Miss Ma?ne” sounds entirely unfamiliar to me and I don’t like it at all. I’m a child, and I’m certainly not important, but this gray-robed priest is a fully-grown adult, and him addressing me with a respectful honorific makes me very uncomfortable. It nettles me.\n\n\n However, in this temple, when I’m given my blue robes, I’ll be treated the same as a noble, so it’s not like I’m going to be able to constantly say “please don’t call me ‘Miss’”. I have no choice but to get used to being called that.\n\n\n “Pardon my intrusion,” I say out of instinct, ducking my head as I enter the head priest’s room.1\n\n\n When I look up, I see that a simple altar has been set up in the middle of the room. I can tell at a glance that this is a simplified version of the massive, many-tiered altar in the ceremonial room that I was in for my baptismal ceremony.\n\n\n The topmost level of the three-tiered stand contains two dolls, one wearing a black cloak and one wearing a golden crown, just like the statues I saw during the baptismal ceremony. On the middle level are five dolls, bearing in turn a staff, a spear, a chalice, a shield, and a sword. The bottom-most level contains flowers, fruits, an incense burner, and a bell, but the closest thing to the edge is a neatly-folded set of blue robes. A blue carpet has been spread out before the altar, which, no matter how much I try to avoid it, brings to mind memories of the prayers from the baptismal ceremony.\n\n\n I’m fairly sure that there wasn’t an altar like this set up the last time I visited the head priest’s room. As I stand there in the entrance, searching my memories, the head priest stands up from his work desk, putting aside what he was doing, and walks before the altar.\n\n\n “This way, Ma?ne.”\n\n\n “Yes, of course,” I reply, hustling a bit to where the priest is standing.\n\n\n He looks down at me with his orange eyes that almost look like they’re golden. He sighs momentarily, then looks over to the altar.\n\n\n “We’re here because you magically coerced the reverend,” he says. “You frighten him, so he very much dislikes you.”\n\n\n “That’s… well, understandable.”\n\n\n The temple master’s haughty attitude and comments had cut me deeply. Regrettably, my emotions caused my mana to explode out of its prison, mixing with my anger and annoyance to rush out towards him. However, I can understand why he, as the result of having my out-of-control mana forced upon him, would hate me, and even maybe carry a grudge.\n\n\n Even under normal circumstances, as the child of poor people, he’d scorn me anyway…\n\n\n “Under ordinary circumstances, you would go to the temple master’s room to pledge yourself to the gods and the temple and then be given your robes, but it would seem Reverend B?sewanz wishes for you not to enter his room, so I rather urgently had to build an altar here.”\n\n\n “…I’m sorry for all the trouble,” I reply.\n\n\n It seems that he hates me very much. For the highest authority in the temple to hate me so irrecoverably from the moment I joined… this is an extremely awful situation to be in, isn’t it?\n\n\n As I worry about all the obstacles I might suddenly face in my life at the temple, the head priest slowly shakes his head.\n\n\n “I would like to avoid adding fuel to this flame, so for now I think it’s best for you not to meet him.”\n\n\n “Of course,” I reply.\n\n\n Since the head priest knows much more about the temple master’s temperament than I do, if he’s saying that, then I really should avoid contact with the temple master.\n\n\n “Now then, let us begin the ceremony of vows.”\n\n\n “Thank you very much.”\n\n\n The head priest picks up the incense burner, grasping it by its chain, and begins to slowly swing it like a pendulum. As he does so, the smoke of the incense within starts to dance, filling the room with a calming scent that’s not unlike frankincense.\n\n\n Then, in a low, careful voice, he begins to explain the meanings behind each of the ritual objects arrayed on the altar. On the highest step, the black cloak represents the night sky, and is thus the symbol of the god of darkness. The golden crown represents the sun, and is the symbol of the goddess of day. These two married gods rule over all the sky, making them the highest-ranked gods, which is why they are placed on the highest step.\n\n\n On the middle step, the staff is the symbol of the goddess of water who washes away the snow and ice, the spear is the symbol of the god of fire who urges life to grow long and tall, the shield is the symbol of the goddess of wind who pushes back the chill of winter, the chalice is the symbol of the goddess of earth who accepts everything she receives, and the sword is the symbol of the god of life who pierces his way into the earth.\n\n\n On the lowest level are the offerings to the gods. The head priest tells me that we offer plants to symbolize breath, fruit to celebrate the harvest, incense to show peace, and cloth to express piety.\n\n\n “The holy color of spring is green. It is the color of the life that passes through the harsh winter to sprout anew. The holy color of summer is blue. It is the color of the sky that life reaches for as it grows ever bigger and taller. The holy color of autumn is yellow. It is the color that wheat becomes when it is ripened, and each stalk bends under its own weight. The holy color of winter is red. It is the color of the hearth that is lit with the hopes that it will soften the cold.”\n\n\n It seems like the colors revered at the temple change as the seasons do. He tells me that the cloth adorning altars, the carpets spread before them, and the decorations that the blue-robed priests wear over their robes follow the colors of the season.\n\n\n “Now, for the speaking of the vows.”\n\n\n He kneels on the carpet before the altar, resting on his left leg. Then, he crosses his hands before his chest, bowing his head. I take my place beside him in the same pose, and he, after quickly ensuring everything is in its place, opens his mouth to speak.\n\n\n “Repeat after me,” he says.\n\n\n “Alright,” I respond.\n\n\n I stare the head priest’s face, carefully watching his mouth to make absolutely sure that I don’t make any mistakes. He speaks slowly, his thin lips moving in a way to make his words easy to understand, as we move through each phrase of the vows.\n\n\n “The highest of all gods, who rule over all in the high, lofty skies, the gods of darkness and light.”\n\n\n “The five gods who rule over all in the wide, vast earth:”\n\n\n “The goddess of water, Frühtr?ne.”\n\n\n “The god of fire, Leidenschaft.”\n\n\n “The goddess of wind, Schutzaria.”\n\n\n “The goddess of earth, Geduldig.”\n\n\n “The god of life, Ewigeliebe.”\n\n\n “The brilliant divine power of the highest of all gods, which shines from the high, lofty skies to spread across the wide, vast earth.”\n\n\n “The divine power of the five gods, which bestow life upon all that exists across the wide, vast earth.”\n\n\n “To return the blessing of this precious divine power,”\n\n\n “We reform our hearts, prepare our hearts, steel our hearts, worship and believe in the gods, who are not confined by the years.”\n\n\n “To all the gods of nature,”\n\n\n “I swear to give my earnest prayers, gratitude, and dedication.”\n\n\n I look up at the head priest when he finishes his recitation, and he nods at me as if to say I did well enough. He stands, looking over at the gray-robed priests standing along the wall. The priest closest to the altar soundlessly walks forward, picking up the set of folded blue robes at the front of the altar and bringing them to the head priest.\n\n\n “Blue is the holy color of the god of fire who helps life grow to its fullest, and the color of the high, lofty skies over which the highest of all gods rules. We give these robes to those priests and priestesses who swear to give faith to those highest of gods and forever strive to grow.”\n\n\n An apprentice priestess that had been waiting along the wall steps forward to dress me in the blue robes that have been given to me. The robes are very simple: they go over my head, then are tied at the waist with a sash. It seems like I’m free to pick what I want to wear under the robes to match the season, and during ceremonies I’ll wear additional ornaments in colors that match particular gods.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you are now a disciple of the gods, piously led by their divine guidance. We of the temple welcome you.”\n\n\n The head priest bends forward slightly, his hands crossed before his chest. I cross my hands in front of my chest as well, mimicking him.\n\n\n “Thank you very much for the warm welcome, from the bottom of my heart,” I say.\n\n\n “Now, give your prayers.”\n\n\n “Um?”\n\n\n I actually don’t understand what I’m so suddenly being instructed to do. I tilt my head in confusion, my hands still crossed in front of my chest. The head priest frowns slightly, as if surprised by my inability to guess what he meant.\n\n\n “You were taught this during your baptismal ceremony, were you not? Lift up your prayers to the gods.”\n\n\n Ah, that? The Glico pose? That’s right. Now that I’m joining the temple, that’s going to be an everyday thing, isn’t it. …Will you be alright, my sides?\n\n\n The imagery of the baptismal ceremony from which I was forced to retreat due to total abdominal collapse flashes through my head. I shake my head to chase the memory away, tightly bracing my stomach to stop myself from laughing. I can keenly feel the sharp gaze of the head priest on me, as if he wants to ask me if I’ve seriously managed to forget it already, so I lift up my praises to the gods.\n\n\n “W… we pray to the gods! …Ngh?!”\n\n\n I’m finding it unexpectedly difficult to hold myself straight upright in the Glico pose. A good sense of balance and enough strength to hold my entire weight on a single leg is an absolute requirement. I can’t maintain the kind of perfect, beautiful Glico pose that I saw all of the priests do during my baptismal ceremony, and I wind up wobbling unsteadily.\n\n\n “Ma?ne! That kind of prayer won’t do at all. You will one day be required to participate in prayer ceremonies for the general public. What would a priestess who could not pray do then? Before such a ceremony, you must make yourself able to give proper prayers.”\n\n\n “Urgh… I will try my very, absolute best.”\n\n\n The head priest sighs, shaking his head, before turning to look at the gray-robed priests lined up along the wall.\n\n\n “Let us introduce you to the gray-robed priests and apprentices who will be your attendants. Arnaud?”\n\n\n Arnaud, a gray-robed priest, indicates three people in gray robes standing in the corner of the room, who then step forward. One of them is an adult man, and the other two are a boy and a girl, about the same age.\n\n\n It looks like the priest who had brought me to this room is going to be my attendant. He’s built relatively solidly, and is about as tall as my father. He has light purple hair and dark brown eyes, and I get the impression that he’s a man of few words. His facial expression is very stiff and silent, like it was when he was bringing me here. It might be because of how tightly his lips are pressed together, but he looks like he might be a little difficult to get acquainted with.\n\n\n “My name is Fran. I’m seventeen years old. I look forward to serving you.”\n\n\n “The pleasure’s all mine,” I reply. “I look forward to working with you as well.”\n\n\n I only meant to politely return his greeting, but the head priest immediately rebukes me.\n\n\n “Ma?ne. You are someone who has been granted blue robes. Do not debase yourself to the gray-robed clergy.”\n\n\n “S… sorry. I’ll be careful.”\n\n\n I don’t get hierarchical societies. I don’t know what’s right or wrong to do. I can’t make any guesses based on anything I’ve learned so far. It’s just like when I first became Ma?ne and I had to learn all of this world’s common knowledge from scratch.\n\n\n Even as I start to succumb to my anxiety, another, even more anxiety-provoking attendant steps forward. I’m not sure if it’s because of nutrition or whatever, but even though he’s about as tall as Lutz is, he’s got a bad look in his eyes and he’s rail-thin. He has pale golden hair, and his eyes appear black at first glance but after a closer look turn out to be a deep purple. My first impression of him is that he’s a clever, awful little brat.\n\n\n Urgh, I hate this type of kid.\n\n\n In my Urano days, I stayed in my room reading a lot, and in my current feeble state I wind up frequently shut inside with a fever, so I’m basically a purebred shut-in. Rude… no, naughty, energetic, sharp-tongued boys are exactly the kind of person I have no desire to get close to at all.\n\n\n I look at him, resigning myself to the fact that I’m going to have to get on good terms with him. He gives me an appraising look in return, looking me over from head to toe with a pretty rude look on his face.\n\n\n “I’m Gil,” he says. “I’m ten. Are you seriously my master? Wow, this sucks. You’re tiny.”\n\n\n “Uh?”\n\n\n Huh? Is it okay for an attendant to act like this?\n\n\n I’m shocked by how he looks like he’s just straight-up scoffing at everyone around him. My mouth flaps wordlessly, and again, the head priest gives a rebuke. Not to Gil, though, but to me.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, Gil is your attendant. If he displays a poor attitude, it is your job to warn him to not do it again.”\n\n\n “Uh? My job?”\n\n\n “If you don’t do it, who will?”\n\n\n He’s talking to me like it’s the most obvious thing in the world, but, how do I actually tell him off? Isn’t he the kind of person who would just ignore anything you tell him?\n\n\n “Umm, could you try to speak a little more nicely?”\n\n\n “Hah! Are you an idiot?!”\n\n\n …Is it okay for me to ask for someone else?\n\n\n The head priest is shaking his head, like he wants to say how my words had no effect at all, but I’m pretty sure this is a fairly obvious mistake in his personnel selection. The thought flashes across my mind that this might be deliberate harassment, and I take a step back.\n\n\n This is, without a doubt, harassment. There’s no way anyone could think that Gil is suitable to be someone’s attendant. This is clearly the result of someone deciding to give the most troublesome person to me, the commoner. Now that I understand this, I realize that trying to deal with him politely is utter folly. I should treat him like I’d treat the rambunctious class clown: ignoring him.\n\n\n I hold up my fist, shutting him up, then I look over to where the last attendant, a young girl, is standing. She has crimson hair and light blue eyes. She’s wearing a fiercely determined expression, but she has a beautiful face. Not a cute face, but a pretty one. I get the impression that she’s the kind of girl who knows just what she looks like and uses that to flatter all the boys. Since we’re both girls, I intuitively sniff that out about her.\n\n\n “My name’s Delia. I’m eight! I hope we can get along.”\n\n\n Despite the fact that she’s saying that she hopes we can get along, her smile isn’t really reaching her eyes. She’s got the kind of air around her that makes me think that we won’t be able to become friends. It looks like she’s ready to go on the offensive. Even still, it seems like the seemingly-smiling Delia is not a pick that the head priest finds particularly problematic. He has no rebuke this time.\n\n\n None of these attendants has even the faintest glimmer of amicability about them. I don’t think I have any hope of being able to deal with these people. I feel like just having them around me would be exhausting.\n\n\n “Umm, Father Ferdinand. I, um, I’ve never had attendants before, so I don’t really need―”\n\n\n “That won’t do. It is an obligation of a blue-robed priest to have attendants. The temple master and I have personally selected these three for you. You are a blue-robed priest. Thus, you are their master, and must conduct yourself accordingly.”\n\n\n “…I see. Alright.”\n\n\n I can’t even say I don’t want them? Plus, I don’t even get to pick?\n\n\n It looks like, even starting from my very first day, just when I’ve taken my vows, I’m faced with frustration.\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. It’s customary in Japan to announce your presence when you enter someone’s room by apologizing for intruding upon their space to bother them."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “The Rite of Vows is now finished.”\n\n\n “So, which way’s the libr—”\n\n\n “Hold on. We have more to discuss.”\n\n\n “…Alright.”\n\n\n At the head priest’s urging, I relocate from before the altar to where his work desk is. Fran brings a chair over for me, and I sit down.\n\n\n “Thanks, Fran,” I say.\n\n\n He looks momentarily startled. “…I require no gratitude,” he replies, frowning slightly.\n\n\n Could even just thanking my attendants be a bad thing, too? The next time I see Freida, I think I’m going to ask her about what noble-like behavior would look like.\n\n\n “Shall we begin?” asks the head priest.\n\n\n “Yes, please,” I reply.\n\n\n He looks over a set of wooden slips and pieces of parchment that he has arranged on his desk. They look like they might contain some sort of written reports. As he scans them, his eyes occasionally flick over to me. Then, as if he were a teacher lecturing a student, he begins to speak.\n\n\n “As you are aware, the blue-robed priests here at the temple are entirely of noble blood. I would like you to consider that there may be nobody here who will think positively of the fact that you, a commoner, have been given blue robes.”\n\n\n “Alright.”\n\n\n I knew this already, but being told this directly to my face causes shivers to run down my spine. Back when I declared that I wanted to be an apprentice priestess, I thought I had only half a year left to live, so I’d figured that none of the conditions mattered as long as I could get to read the books in the library.\n\n\n However, the temple has magical tools. Becoming a blue-robed apprentice priestess has allowed me to lengthen my lifespan, but now there is no strict limit on how long I will be associating with the temple. I can’t approach things here with the same sort of desperate mindset that I’d had before. I have a lot of things I need to carefully consider.\n\n\n “As of now,” he continues, “we have few blue-robed priests here. As we need people who possess mana, the matter of your origins will be overlooked for now, but in a few years, the number of noblemen here will once again rise. I don’t know what will happen to you at that point. When I do have some idea, I will let you know in advance of it occurring.”\n\n\n “…Okay.”\n\n\n I bite my lip, clenching my fists in my lap. If I make any sort of blunder with respect to the nobility, then it won’t just affect me, but my family would be caught up in it too. All I want is information that I can use to make sure everything here goes smoothly.\n\n\n “In particular, Reverend B?sewanz feels so strongly about this that he refused to participate in your Rite of Vows. As you are not even acquainted with any of the other blue-robed priests, it cannot be said that any of them hold you in any good regard. As such, the task of providing you with guidance falls upon me.”\n\n\n I possess mana and money, but no social standing whatsoever. Nobles, who are very used to their special privileges, could see my presence here as effectively trampling on their rights. I don’t think any of them would be happy about that. I know that. However, even though the head priest is emphasizing that no nobleman would have good feelings about me, the warning he’s giving me is extremely polite.\n\n\n “Father, aren’t you uncomfortable about this? About, um, me…”\n\n\n “I believe you are a person of great value, especially in light of our current situation. As the number of blue-robed priests and priestesses has declined, the official duties of the temple have all become concentrated on me. There is no way that I could refuse the freely-offered assistance of someone who is as good at paperwork as you, no?”\n\n\n As he laughs heartily, I freeze for a moment. For him to be able to say that I’m good at paperwork, that means that the investigation he mentioned earlier is already complete, and a lot of information about me has already found its way to him. This is a world where the concept of personal information security doesn’t exist in the slightest. If a nobleman such as the head priest were to ask, I’m sure that anyone and everyone would fall over themselves to tell him everything he wanted to hear about. Just how much about me does he know? This is terrifying.\n\n\n “I’ll do my very best,” I say, “but what are my duties here at the temple? If there’s anything I need to be doing, please tell me.”\n\n\n “Yes. Your duties are, for one, helping me with the paperwork. This is your most important task. I will have you spend every morning working here. Next are prayers and dedications. As a priestess in particular, it will be most troublesome for you if you cannot make yourself able to perform your prayers.”\n\n\n “I know what prayers are, but what are dedications?”\n\n\n “Supplying the votive tools with your mana. Fran, the shield.”\n\n\n Fran nods slightly, then retrieves a shield. The shield is round, somewhere between fifty and sixty centimeters in diameter, and made of something that looks like gold. Just like something called a votive tool should be, it’s covered in intricate designs, with patterns in blue here and there.\n\n\n In the center of the shield is a large, yellow gemstone, about the side of my hand, glimmering in such a way that it looks like there’s a flame gently burning inside of it. A border of similar, but smaller stones, about the size of marbles, line the edge of the shield. Only half of the stones are yellow, however. The rest of them are clear, like crystal.\n\n\n “Please touch the central magic stone. Then, imagine sending the mana within you out towards it…”\n\n\n “Okay.”\n\n\n It looks like these aren’t gemstones, but magic stones. My heart pounds excitedly as I reach my right hand out towards the extremely fantasy-setting-like shield. When my hand touches the gem, the entire shield lights up with a brilliant golden glow. At the same time, complex designs and symbols the like of which I’d never seen before form out of emerald light, lifting off of the shield until they’re about at the height of my wrist.\n\n\n Aaah! It’s like a magic circle! This is amazing!!\n\n\n As I succumb to my curiosity, staring at the gleaming symbols, I feel a strange sensation inside me, like there’s a vacuum cleaner sucking away at the fever that’s burning inside my body. It’s the same feeling that I felt back when I was about to die of the devouring and Freida used a magical tool to save me.\n\n\n I reach deep inside me for the mana I’ve been keeping tightly bottled up inside me for so long, then, tentatively, loosen the seal. The burning fever of the devouring rushes out of my heart, and instantly starts streaming toward my hand, where it’s sucked away into the stone. As the pleasant feeling of having this unwanted fever sucked out of my heart washes over me, I’m suddenly hit with a thought.\n\n\n …This isn’t going to break, is it?\n\n\n I suddenly remember how the magic tool Freida lent me had broken, and get a little scared that it might happen again. I unconsciously pull back my hand, sealing the mana, which has decreased by a little bit, back inside my heart.\n\n\n Releasing my mana took only a moment, but in even that amount of time, I can feel just how much of the burden it was putting on my body has decreased. My body feels so light, like a heavy stone that’s been weighing me down has suddenly lifted.\n\n\n “Hmm,” murmurs the head priest, “seven small stones…”\n\n\n When I hear that, I look over at the shield. I see that more of the stones decorating the edge of the shield are yellow now. It looks like they change color when they’re full of mana. That way, you can tell how much mana is left in the shield at a glance.\n\n\n …Why do I feel like I’ve become a battery charger?\n\n\n I hesitantly close the hand I’d used to channel my mana as variety of thoughts drift through my head. I guess the devouring fever really is mana, I think. And it was surprisingly easy to send my mana out as soon as there was a clear exit for it, too…\n\n\n As I ponder, the head priest looks at me with a worried expression.\n\n\n “Was that too much stress on your body?”\n\n\n “Ummm, it actually felt sort of refreshing. I feel like my body’s gotten lighter.”\n\n\n “…Is that so? Then, you will be performing as many dedications as you can without putting any undue stress on your body.”\n\n\n “Understood,” I reply.\n\n\n Charging votive tools is called dedication, is it? This seems like some fairly easy work. It looks like the hardest part of my duties as a priestess will be praying. Standing on one leg is already considerably difficult for me with my body as it is right now. On top of that, I’m not able to have my hands out to the side for balance. I’m going to need to stretch them up at an angle, which is even harder. There’s probably strict guidance on the proper angles I’ll need to be holding my arms at and for how long I’ll need to maintain the pose, too.\n\n\n “Your final task is to read the scriptures and memorize their contents.”\n\n\n He says it offhandedly, in a small, quiet tone, but my ears pick up his words with perfect clarity. He said read and memorize, didn’t he? I don’t really have that much confidence in my memory, but if there’s reading involved then I’ll gladly take on the task.\n\n\n “I’ll do it! I’ll go to the library right now!”\n\n\n I stand up quickly, my chair clattering behind me, and I raise my clenched fist, trying to show him just how enthusiastic I am. He, however, isn’t looking at me. Instead, he’s picked up another piece of parchment and is looking it over.\n\n\n “Before that, I’d like to talk about the matter of your donation. Please, be seated.”\n\n\n “…Alright.”\n\n\n Money is a very important topic, all the more so because of how much money I declared I’d be willing to donate. I’ve been particularly concerned about this, mostly about how I’d pay it, and what it would go to.\n\n\n “I believe you said you would pay a sum of one large gold coin…”\n\n\n As the head priest looks down at me, I think back to the conversations I’d had with Benno about this. He’d first told me that the merchant’s guild actually collects donations from its members to make offerings for all of the ceremonies performed throughout the year, so he’d never made an offering directly to the church himself. Then, he’d told me that since the size of my donation is so unnecessarily high, there’s a good chance that I’m going to catch the attention of someone without my best interests in mind. A payment schedule would be a better idea than a single donation. Being so incompetently wild with my monetary donations would only bring trouble on everyone around me.\n\n\n “Ummm,” I say, “I did say I would pay it, and I can pay it, but could I perhaps pay it over time at the rate of one small gold coin per month?”\n\n\n “I am not the one to specify donations, so it is not as if you cannot defer payment, but what is your reasoning?” \n\n “An acquaintance told me that donating the entire sum at once might cause people to be dazzled by the large sum of money and spend it unnecessarily… I’ve been thinking that it would be best to ask someone who manages the temple’s finances how the money is allocated and what it is spent on, and then decide on how my donation should be paid.”\n\n\n I really can’t say it as plainly as the way Benno said it. But even though I’d prevaricated so much, it seems like the head priest has figured out what I meant. He slowly inhales, pondering my words.\n\n\n “Fifty percent of our donations go to maintenance of the temple, and the remaining money is divided amongst the blue-robed priests. The money allocated to the priests is divided based on relative social standing. Speaking as the person who manages the temple’s finances, I think that it would be best for you to donated five small gold coins up front, with the remainder paid in monthly increments of one small gold coin.”\n\n\n “Why that amount?” I ask, tilting my head.\n\n\n The head priest picks up a stack of bound parchment and holds it out for me. When I look over it, I’m startled to see that it’s part of a ledger. The head priest points at the top sheet, running down the list.\n\n\n “In broad terms, our temple’s primary income comes from the offerings given to us by the lord of the land as well as the alms we collect at our ceremonies. Beyond that, the families of the blue-robed priests give money to the temple to support them. In other words, as the number of blue-robed priests has declined, so has our income. To put things in terms a merchant can understand, we are running at a deficit. Furthermore, the temple master has instructed me to wring as much money out of you as possible, so it would help me out if I could secure a large enough payment to curry favor with him.”\n\n\n I have a feeling he might be a little too forthcoming telling me about the state of affairs, but is it really okay for me to hear about how the temple’s running in the red?\n\n\n “Ummm, Father Ferdinand, is it… really okay to be telling me this information?”\n\n\n “In a few days, this is going to be your job, so I don’t see any problem with telling you about this now.”\n\n\n It looks like helping with the paperwork isn’t going to be just helping with calculations like I was doing with Otto. I’m going to be plunged straight into the middle of things.\n\n\n “…I understand. How should I get the money to you? I usually use my guild card to transfer money, but you probably don’t have one, do you?”\n\n\n “Can’t you simply bring the money here?”\n\n\n That’s easy for him to say, but I’ve only ever done my dealings with the guild card. I’ve never actually held a gold coin in my own hands. The thought of a child like me carrying a huge sum of money all the way from the guild to the temple is far too terrifying. I’m such a timid person that even when I was collecting my commission on my winder handiwork, I had to have Mark carry it for me.\n\n\n “It may be simple for you, since you’re used to large amounts of money, but to me that’s a terrifying amount of money to be carrying.”\n\n\n He sighs. “What do you think you have attendants for?”\n\n\n Huh? Attendants?\n\n\n I glance back over my shoulder at the attendants standing quietly behind me, then tilt my head. There’s no way that I could trust any of those failures of personnel selection with large amounts of money. If Fran’s still listening to the head priest’s orders, then there’s a chance he’ll listen to me, but Delia and Gil already hate me, so using one of them is a pretty scary thought. Given their attitudes to me so far, I don’t think I can depend on any one of my attendants.\n\n\n “I don’t want to get anyone else involved. What if I give it to them, and then you say you never received it? I don’t care if I’m the one carrying it or someone else is, it’s still terrifying.”\n\n\n “…You have no trust in your attendants?” he says, looking as if he’s finding this concept strange.\n\n\n I can’t help but think this whole thing is strange myself. Are nobles really able to meet someone for the first time, notice their terrible reactions to them, and then immediately trust them with five small gold coins? Or, do they maybe have some sort of magical contract set up so that their servants can never betray them? When I think back on our introduction, I can’t remember anything contract-like involved. Magic contracts involve bleeding, so I’m pretty sure I would have noticed.\n\n\n “Even if you call them my attendants, these are still people who I’ve just met, over whom I have no binding authority, right? I’d ordinarily never be able to suddenly trust someone like that well enough that I’d let them carry huge amounts of money for me.”\n\n\n On top of that, these people aren’t even showing a tiny sliver of friendliness, you know? Absolutely no way. If I had to choose who to trust between these attendants and the guild master, I’d definitely pick the guild master.\n\n\n There are very few adults I’d trust with a large amount of money. I wonder if I could get Benno or Mark to bring it? The head priest is a nobleman, so if I frame this to Benno as an opportunity to make a connection, I don’t think he would refuse. I’d be really happy if he didn’t, at least.\n\n\n “If I were to have an adult that I trust, who is used to handling large amounts of money, come with me to deliver it, might I be able to have that person come with me into the temple?”\n\n\n “Who is this person?”\n\n\n “The man who has effectively been my guardian in matters of commerce: the proprietor of the Gilberta Company, Mister Benno.”\n\n\n “…Hm, alright.”\n\n\n When Lutz comes to pick me up, I should stop by the shop to discuss this with Benno. While I’m there, I might as well try to ask him if he might know how I go about making use of attendants. Maybe there’s some similarities between how you make use of attendants and how you make use of an employee.\n\n\n As I contemplate, the head priest closes the ledger and hands it to Arnaud.\n\n\n “That’s all I had to say to you today. Do you have any questions, Ma?ne?”\n\n\n “Yes! I’d really like to read the books in the library until Lutz comes to pick me up at the library, but can I really enter the library? I definitely want to do my job and memorize the scriptures!”\n\n\n “By Lutz, you mean the boy who manages your physical condition? You should work to ensure that your attendants will be able to manages your condition as well.”\n\n\n I’d asked about whether or not I could enter the library, but he turned the conversation to managing my condition. I once again look back at my attendants. There’s Gil, who’s scratching his head, very obviously completely unmotivated. There’s Delia, currently staring vacantly out the window. And finally, there’s Fran, who’s looking right past me to watch the head priest. I can’t see any of them ever actually being able to manage my condition.\n\n\n “My family has told me that Lutz should continue to accompany me until my attendants are capable of managing my health. I know that this is a large burden on him, so I too really want this to happen quickly. If we all try hard, I’m sure it’ll happen. …So, can I go to the library now?”\n\n\n “Yes. Fran, show her the way.”\n\n\n “Of course, Father.”\n\n\n At the head priests command, Fran crosses his hands in front of his chest, a faint smile drifting across his face as he nods. The proud look on his face is completely different to the expression he’d been wearing when he was looking at me. It’s easy to see who Fran’s master truly is.\n\n\n Well, you know, if he’s the gray-robed priest that the head priest specifically assigned to me, then he’s probably pretty safe. He seems to adore the head priest, so he probably won’t be doing anything particularly problematic.\n\n\n I skip along merrily behind Fran as I silently judge him.\n\n\n Whatever else is happening, I’m going to the library! This is work! This is my job!\n\n\n As I bounce lightly along, Delia and Gil follow behind me. After we’re out of earshot of the head priest’s room, though, Gil clicks his tongue.\n\n\n “Why would anyone ever want to go to the library,” he spits. “Are you some kind of idiot?”\n\n\n Sparks fly through my head. You’re the idiot for not recognizing the magnificence of books!\n\n\n I stop in place, spinning on my heel, then give him the hardest glare I can muster. Gil looks ready for battle, his face scrunched up so hard that his nose is wrinkling.\n\n\n “What’s that look for?” he says. “You’re not even a noble. You’re just a commoner, aren’t you? You’re not even different from the rest of us, but you get a nice set of blue robes and you think you get to look all self-important. You’re not my master. I’m absolutely never going to do anything you tell me, and I’m going to do my absolute best to get on your nerves.”\n\n\n Just like he’s saying he doesn’t think of me as his master, I can’t possibly think of him as my attendant. As I am right now, I don’t possess the strength, willpower, or affection to teach this rude little brat and manners. So, I’ll ignore him.\n\n\n “Ah, I see. Same here.”\n\n\n “…Huh? You see what?! You think I’m an idiot or something?!”\n\n\n He starts to yell angrily, and I turn my back on him, continuing to walk. Moments later, I hear a young girl’s high voice from behind me.\n\n\n “You really are an idiot.”\n\n\n “Delia?”\n\n\n She snorts disdainfully, every trace of her fake smile vanishing from her face. I’d thought that she was the type that liked to flatter the boys, so I’d been expecting that she’d never actually show her true colors as long as the other attendants were around, so seeing her change so quickly leaves me a little shocked.\n\n\n It looks like I have to change my estimation of her. Maybe she’s not actually the kind of person who fawns all over men and pretends to be everyone’s friend. Is she maybe more of a carnivorous hunter-type, who only actually flirts with the target she’s set her eyes on?\n\n\n As I watch, she flips her crimson hair, looking exactly as aloof and arrogant as any antagonist in a shoujo manga. The fact that she can pull that look off at eight years old is actually pretty scary.\n\n\n “Argh, seriously! I’d finally managed to become an apprentice under Reverend B?sewanz, but then who in the world does he reassign me to but a girl who isn’t even receptive to my charm? And a stupid, penniless child at that? This is the worst.”\n\n\n It seems she was assigned to me by the temple master. There’s no way she’d be friendly. Even still, didn’t she just declare out loud that she’s a spy? Did the temple master tell her to do that too?\n\n\n I tilt my head, puzzled by her sudden declaration. “Alright, then, I’ll find someone else to take your place.”\n\n\n Even though I’d delivered what I thought would be good news, she only sticks her nose even higher in the air as she starts to lose her temper.\n\n\n “Seriously! You are absolutely an idiot. As if you could replace me. What do you think you’re saying!”\n\n\n That’s my line. What does she think she’s saying?\n\n\n “Reverend B?sewanz himself personally asked me to make trouble for you! If I’m replaced, then that’s just going to make him doubt my abilities!”\n\n\n I can hear what she’s saying, but I am absolutely not following her logic. I don’t understand this at all. There is no way that I’d want to be anywhere near someone who so openly declares that she was personally asked by the temple master to harass me. I would like nothing more than to replace her immediately.\n\n\n As I think that, though, I come to a sudden realization. Even if I can get rid of Delia, then the temple master is only going to have a different attendant assigned to me. I’d much rather have someone so conspicuously easy to read as Delia than someone who is actually good at skulking around. It would be a lot safer for me.\n\n\n Delia interrupts my train of though by thrusting her finger in my face.\n\n\n “Even if you’re wearing a blue robe, I’m not afraid of you! I’m absolutely going to be recognized by Reverend B?sewanz, and then I’m going to be his mistress!”\n\n\n Did I mishear her? Or maybe is it popular among little girls to dream of making a contract and being someone’s mistress? I feel an echo of the same shock I felt when I heard Freida say the same thing. Then, I suddenly remember just how old the temple master is, and revulsion creeps over me. The temple master being a pervert who’s into little girls is completely and utterly beyond my expectations. Based on the gray-robed priestess I’d seen before, I thought he’d be more into the secretarial type, but I see my eyes have betrayed me.\n\n\n “…Uh, is being a mistress something to be proud of?”\n\n\n “Of course! Being a mistress is the highest position a girl could hope for. What, you don’t know that? Well, I guess if you’re not as cute as me then it’s pointless even if you wanted it.”\n\n\n “Huh? Is being a mistress really the best thing you could hope for?”\n\n\n This doesn’t line up with any of my common sense at all. At least, when I was talking with Freida about the concept of mistresses, she seemed to be on the same page as me when it came to the nuances of the idea. At the very least, she wasn’t saying that it was something you’d puff out your chest and swagger around over like this.\n\n\n As I stand there, trying and failing to immediately reconcile these two viewpoints, Gil gives me the most unpleasant grin, shrugging his shoulders mockingly.\n\n\n “Isn’t it obvious? If you become a blue-robed priest’s mistress, then you get to boss around the other gray-robed priests, right? And if you get to be the temple master’s priestess, then none of the other gray-robed priests can ever bother you. That’s the best thing for a girl. …But yeah, are you sure your head’s on straight? Why don’t you know something so obvious?”\n\n\n Even though he’s sneering at my ignorance, I don’t feel the slightest stirring of anger. Rather, I just didn’t know that a girl in the orphanage would think that the best thing they could hope for would be to become the mistress of someone influential. The idea of becoming a mistress being the best thing that could happen to a girl is just something that isn’t common knowledge among anyone I’ve come in contact with. These people, however, have lived their lives in the temple, and that’s common knowledge here. I’ve lived a different life than the other people here, so no matter what I say, I don’t think I’ll be able to make them able to understand.\n\n\n “Gil, be silent!” yells Fran, looking at his wits’ end.\n\n\n Gil, however, doesn’t look the slightest bit cowed. Instead, he laughs scoffingly at me.\n\n\n “Oh, no, this is all her fault for not knowing it. It’s something everyone knows, right?”\n\n\n “…Miss Ma?ne, please recall what Father Ferdinand told you earlier, about rebuking an attendant if their behavior is out of line.”\n\n\n “Ah, that’s right. Incidentally, is this the library?”\n\n\n I don’t even care the slightest bit anymore. Rebuking Gil and Delia is something that I don’t have any interest in spending the time or energy on. Fran adores the head priest and most likely isn’t happy about being forced to work for me. Delia wants to be the temple master’s mistress and plans to get in my way as much as possible. Gil, the moment we met, announced that he had no intention of serving me, and thinks I’m an idiot for ignoring him.\n\n\n Instead of spending my time figuring out how I could possibly handle attendants like these, I think I’d much, much rather read a book.\n\n\n “I will inform the head priest of this,” says Fran.\n\n\n “By all means,” I reply.\n\n\n Fran sighs, then pushes a door open, heading inside. When I see the paradise waiting for me beyond the door, my heart starts to pound. I’m a little nervous that I might still be barred from entry, so I reach a trembling arm out and start slowly walking forward, feeling the air ahead of me for any invisible walls. Unlike before, nothing holds me back, and I’m able to enter the library.\n\n\n “Aaah!!”\n\n\n The moment I step fully into the room, the atmosphere instantly changes. I tremble with emotion as I inhale deeply, savoring the unique scent of a dusty archive filled with old tomes. The smell is different from the archives that I know, perhaps because parchment is so prevalent, and perhaps because of how many wooden boards there are here. I wonder if there’s a difference in quality of the ink here? Despite the differences, the smell of ink and old paper makes me so nostalgic and so happy that my eyes grow hot.\n\n\n There aren’t that many bookshelves in this room. Some of them have closed doors hiding their contents, and others are stuffed with wooden boards and loose papers. There’s separate shelves that seem to be set aside for scrolls, and some shelves are lined with rolls of cloth like you’d see at a fabric store. Each roll is wrapped around a book, and has the title of the book written on a label hanging off of it. Towards the back of the room are a set of cylindrical stands, each keeping a set of scrolls and bearing a label listing the title of the set it contains.\n\n\n Equally-spaced windows allow shafts of sunlight to spill into the room, and a long reading table, like one might see at a university, is placed so that it perfectly catches the light. Atop a slanted bookrest sit several books, each chained to a spot above it. As I try to figure out which to read, Fran indicates one in particular.\n\n\n “These are the scriptures,” he says.\n\n\n At his urging, I reach for the tome of scriptures bound by chain, gently touching the surface of its leather binding. Then, I unfasten the small belt along its fore-edge that prevents it from opening. In the next moment, the fore-edge expands, the cover opening a little on its own. This is a perfectly natural thing for a book made of parchment, which absorbs moisture, to do. To me, however, it feels like the book itself wants to be read.\n\n\n Ahh, how long has it been since I’ve last touched a book?\n\n\n When I open the front cover, the chains jangle, the sound filling the interior fo the library. The pages are slightly yellowed with age, and my fingers tremble as I reach out to turn them. My eyes trace over the words, written in someone’s slightly quirky handwriting, and I begin to read.\n\n\n “Hey, it’s noon. It’s time for lunch.”\n\n\n It has been so long since I’ve been able to immerse myself in such bliss, but a nuisance has appeared to take me out of it. If he’d just said something it wouldn’t have even reached my ears, but since he’s actually shaking my arm, I have no choice but to bring myself back to reality.\n\n\n “Gil, no talking in the library. If you can’t be silent, then please leave. I’m in the middle of reading.”\n\n\n “Huh?!” he shouts, startled. “It’s lunch time!”\n\n\n To me, though, there isn’t even any point comparing eating lunch to reading a book. If I have a book to read, I can go two days without even feeling the slightest bit hungry.\n\n\n “Well, since it seems like I’m not your master, then there’s no point in you being here, is there? You can go eat whenever you want, so get out.”\n\n\n “You—”\n\n\n I’d tried be nice to him and give him his freedom, but he just stares wide-eyed at me, getting ready to say something else.\n\n\n “Leave. Me. Alone.”\n\n\n Rather than let things continue until I lose my cool, I deliberately loosen the cap on my mana and let it diffuse throughout my body, then immediately release the power that I’d somehow held onto after the dedication. In the next instant, Fran grabs Gil and Delia by the scruff of their necks and frantically runs out of the room.\n\n\n Ah, and now it’s quiet again.\n\n\n I lock my mana back up in the depths of my heart, and I continue to flow through sentence after sentence. Not a single person came by to bother me, all the way until the fourth bell rang and Lutz came to pick me up."

I race down the stairs towards him, grab his arm tightly, and burrow my head into him.\n\n\n “I’m so exhausted, Lutz!”\n\n\n “Yeah, you look kinda pale. Rough day, huh?”\n\n\n He gives me a sympathetic look as he pats me on the head. What I did today was basically just read a book, but it seems like being with me is my attendants’ entire job, so the basically the entire time someone was standing near me, constantly watching me.\n\n\n Of course, when I’m absorbed in a book, it’s typical for me to be completely and utterly unconcerned by my surroundings, but every time I came to my senses I could feel someone’s gaze fixed on me, which made me really uncomfortable. You could call those stares painful, or heavy, but either way being constantly watched is a huge burden. It’s left me exhausted.\n\n\n Man, nobles are amazing. How long does it even take to get used to that?\n\n\n I’m just happy because I get to go home in order to sleep. If I had to deal with all that from “good morning” to “good night”, I would go insane.\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz. I want to meet with Mister Benno today, is he at the shop?”\n\n\n “He actually just got back right when I was leaving, so he should probably be in right now, I think? Why, did something happen?”\n\n\n He looks worried, so I shake my head.\n\n\n “No, I just need to go to the merchant’s guild to withdraw money for my donation and bring it to the head priest. I figured I should tell him about it in advance…”\n\n\n “Hmm! Alright, let’s go.”\n\n\n When he says that, for some reason, the trio of attendants behind me starts heading with us at well. I don’t even want them following me around in the temple, so I really don’t want them following me around outside, too! I really don’t want to be stared at.\n\n\n “…You don’t need to come with me, you know?”\n\n\n “I’m afraid I cannot leave you,” replies Fran. “I am your attendant, after all.”\n\n\n “That’s right!” adds Delia. “It’s impossible for you to meet with anyone without your attendants around.”\n\n\n Since it’s not just Fran telling me it’s impossible, but even Delia too, I guess it must be common knowledge that a blue-robed priest never meets with anyone without their attendants. I’ll have to add this to the list I’m keeping in my head.\n\n\n “Hmm?” says Gil. “Well, if I don’t have to go, then yeah, I’m out of here. I’m starving.”\n\n\n As I thought, Gil, who’s disinterested in even an attendant’s common sense, shoots me a resentful glare as he turns his back on us and starts heading back inside. The other two, however, aren’t following suit. If I had to compromise and bring someone along, Fran’s the only one I’d be able to have follow me around. Even still, I’d be able to relax a lot more if I didn’t have any of my attendants following me around. Plus, I’m just going to the Gilberta Company, where I go all the time, and since I have Lutz with me I don’t have any particular use for an attendant.\n\n\n …Can I just drive them off?\n\n\n “Oh, Delia,” I say. “Could you go tell Father Ferdinand that I’m going to come back with my donation once I’m done talking with Mister Benno? I really need him to know about this. I’m relying on you!”\n\n\n “Hmm? You really need it? Alright then. I’ll make absolutely sure to go tell him right away.”\n\n\n The wide smile she gives me is unbelievably easy to read. I wonder, is she just going to do literally nothing, or is she just going to go straight to the temple master instead? She turns around, looking the happiest I’ve seen her all day, and goes back into the temple.\n\n\n I breathe a sigh of relief over having managed to drive her off. Fran, however, grimaces in displeasure, looking back and forth between me and the departing Delia.\n\n\n “Miss Ma?ne, if you would like a message delivered to Father Ferdinand, I would be happy to do so. Please allow me to accompany Delia.”\n\n\n “Fran, I’ve already sent Delia. If you’re telling me that I have to have an attendant with me, then would it really be okay for you to go with her?”\n\n\n Fran shakes his head, his displeasure still clear on his face.\n\n\n “But, I can’t say if she’ll even go see Father Ferdinand…”\n\n\n “…I have Lutz here with me, so I’ll be fine if you go tell Father Ferdinand, you know? I really do need someone to go tell him about this.”\n\n\n As I say this, I grab Lutz’s hand and start walking. Fran stands in the temple’s entranceway for a while, turning indecisively back and forth, but he ultimately seems to decide that he’d prefer to report to the head priest, and heads back into the temple.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, are you sure that’s alright? Isn’t he supposed to be learning how to keep an eye on your condition?”\n\n\n Lutz looks over his shoulder, tilting his head as he looks back at the empty temple entrance. Come to think of it, I was told to let my attendants monitor my health, wasn’t I? As I think that, I let out an enormous sigh.\n\n\n “…Hmmm. He is one of the attendants picked for me by the temple, but I still think it’ll be difficult. First off, he really doesn’t have any enthusiasm for it.”\n\n\n “Huh?” he replies, disbelievingly.\n\n\n “I think that, probably, he really wanted to serve the head priest, but he got told that he was being assigned to me instead. He always looked like he was doing things kind of begrudgingly, no matter what we were doing. If I could maybe make him consider me his master more than the head priest, that might change, but I’m pretty sure that’s hopeless, right?”\n\n\n “You, a master… don’t you need, like, dignity and presence for that?”\n\n\n He laughs teasingly at me, and I can’t help but start laughing too. I feel so much better now that I’m back in such a comfortable environment.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Good afternoon, Mister Mark,” I say. “Is Mister Benno in?”\n\n\n As Lutz opens the door to the shop, I see Mark inside and, as I always do, wave as I call out to him. The instant he sees me, though, his face turns pale.\n\n\n “…Ma?ne, quickly, please come in.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n Mark, in an atypical hurry, rushes to show the two of us inside. Under ordinary circumstances, when we drop by without having made arrangements beforehand we’re usually asked to wait inside the store for a while, then are brought into the back room when Benno is able to see us. Today, however, Mark immediately opens the door to the back room and pushes us through, his face still drained of blood as he calls out to Benno.\n\n\n “Master Benno, Ma?ne has come to see you. I’m showing her in.”\n\n\n “What’s this now, Mark?” replies Benno. “Why’re you being so hasty when it’s just Ma?ne… dropping…”\n\n\n Mark shuts the door behind us as Benno looks up from his desk. When he sees me, he just stares at me for a moment, then immediately flies into a rage, his eyes wide.\n\n\n “Ma?ne! You! Idiot!”\n\n\n I squeak in fright, covering my ears as I recoil. Lutz flinches too, his breath audibly hitching as he steps back.\n\n\n “Uh? Huh? You too? What now?!”\n\n\n “You thoughtless little kid! You came here looking like that?! Don’t tell me you walked here all the way from the temple wearing that?!”\n\n\n I look down at myself, then tilt my head curiously. “…Yes, I did, is there a problem with that?”\n\n\n Lutz tilts his head too. Benno looks at the two of us, sees that we aren’t able to understand why there could be a problem here at all, and scratches his head vigorously in frustration. Mark closes his eyes, rubbing at his temples.\n\n\n “Ma?ne,” says Benno. “You’re wearing the clothing that a blue-robed priestess wears, aren’t you?”\n\n\n “Yes,” I reply.\n\n\n “Ordinarily, blue-robed priestesses are nobility.”\n\n\n “That’s right,” I reply.\n\n\n “When the nobility have to travel, they ride in carriages. They’re not able to just wander around the city on foot. Can you tell me why that is?”\n\n\n I tilt my head further as I consider his question. I think back to the few times I’ve ridden in a carriage. It shook a lot as it was moving and felt pretty terrible to ride. However, riding in one is something that us commoners never really get to do often. All we can do is stare yearningly as they ride past. So, it’s a great way to instantly show off how high your status is.\n\n\n Back in my Urano days, I had a car, of course, to use for transportation, but I didn’t use it all the time. It made sense for when I went shopping and knew that I was going to be buying more than I could carry, or when I was going on long trips. I also drove when the weather was bad enough to make walking difficult.\n\n\n “Ummm… because walking is too hard and not ostentatious enough?”\n\n\n “Wrong! If they’re staggering around on the streets, then they will be abducted and held for ransom! So if you don’t want to be abducted, then don’t wear that robe outside of the temple!”\n\n\n “Y-y-y-yes s-sir!!”\n\n\n I immediately start taking off my robe on the spot. Since I already have my apprentice wear on underneath, it’s as simple as undoing the sash and pulling the robe over my head.\n\n\n I’ve always been the child of poor people. I hadn’t even considered the idea that anyone would want to kidnap me and hold me ransom.\n\n\n I see now. I’ve been thinking of this blue robe like it was just another kind of uniform, but to other people I’m basically wearing a sign that with “HELLO, I AM NOBILITY, I HAVE MONEY” written on it in big, bold letters.\n\n\n After I finish neatly folding my robe, Benno sighs exhaustedly, looking down at the bundle of cloth in my arms with a complicated expresion.\n\n\n “Well then… why are you here, Ma?ne? Surely you didn’t show up here just to try to scare us to death, right?”\n\n\n “Right. I have a favor to ask. Would you mind accompanying me to the merchant’s guild, and then after that to the temple?”\n\n\n “What for?” he asks, his head tilted in incomprehension.\n\n\n “I’d like for your help in withdrawing five small gold coins for my donation and bringing it to the temple. I’ve already asked the head priest, and he said it was okay.”\n\n\n “Why me?”\n\n\n “All of my large transactions so far have been done through my guild card, but the head priest doesn’t have one of those. I’m kind of scared of walking around with that much money on me. When I told that to the head priest, he told me to have my attendants take care of it, which actually surprised me a little.”\n\n\n Benno frowns, his eyebrows knitting together. “What’s surprising about that? That’s an attendant’s job, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “…I genuinely, completely, thoroughly distrust my attendants. The thought of trusting them with a large amount of money is utterly terrifying.”\n\n\n Benno pauses for a moment, eyes wide, then blinks a few times.\n\n\n “So, the girl who never thinks anything through, who constantly just shrugs her way through problems, who is so resistant to learning from her mistakes that she still goes to the guild master’s house after being so massively deceived, has finally found someone she distrusts? Please, tell me, just who are these individuals?”\n\n\n I’m still going to the guild master’s house because it’s beneficial for me, though. I get to trade recipes for sugar, and even though the guild master had deceived me about the magical tools there’s no question that he saved my life. Of course, I don’t have enough trust in them to let them carry my money for me, but if I’m dealing with them as partners in a mutual transaction, then I’ll shrug my way through that particular problem.\n\n\n There’s no way that I could ever trust someone who flat-out say so my face that they’re going to intentionally cause trouble for me.\n\n\n “Out of the three attendants I was assigned, one of them is a spy for the temple master, one is a spy for the head priest, and one of them is a problem child who seems like he was assigned to me purely as harassment. I don’t even want them loitering around near me at the temple, much less carrying any amount of money for me.”\n\n\n “That’s… I’d thought this might happen, but you really made some enemies over there, didn’t you.”\n\n\n I groan a little at how accurately he hit the nail on the head.\n\n\n “Back when I thought that I only had half a year left to live, I was thinking that it didn’t matter how well-liked I was as long as I got to read books, but if this is going to go on for a while then this is really going to be a problem.”\n\n\n “Circumstances really are different now. So, for the spies, all you can do right now is try to improve your surface-level relationships with them. You don’t need to trust them, but figure out what exactly you can trust them with. …And for that problem child, you’re basically going to treat him like you’d treat a wild animal.\n\n\n The image of Gil as a wild baby monkey atop a tree, clapping his hands and shrieking down at me, floats through my mind.\n\n\n \"People aren’t animals, though?”\n\n\n “They’re basically the same thing. If they don’t do what you say, give them a lashing. If they do, give them a treat. If you want him to know who his master is, you’ll need to beat it into him.”\n\n\n That sounds less like building a healthy relationship of mutual trust and more like just forcing him into subservience.\n\n\n “…That sounds like it would take a lot of time that I would rather spend reading, though.”\n\n\n “Don’t be lazy! Being in noble society and not knowing how to use your attendants is a serious issue!”\n\n\n “Ngh… Okay, I’ll think about the future.”\n\n\n Benno lets out a long sigh, then lightly shakes his head as if to reset his thoughts.\n\n\n “We’ve gotten off topic. So, when are you going to be delivering this donation?”\n\n\n “That’s what I’m here to discuss with you, though? I told my attendants that we’d be back with the money as soon as it was convenient for you—”\n\n\n The color instantly leaves Benno’s face.\n\n\n “—Which means you basically said ‘immediately’! Mark, get things ready! We’re going to the temple!”\n\n\n “At once, sir!”\n\n\n Mark leaps out of the room, ghastly pale.\n\n\n “Uh, um, so, then we’re going to the merchant’s guild?”\n\n\n “No time to waste on that. We don’t actually need to go. Card?”\n\n\n After we tap our cards together, Benno tells me to put my robes back on since we’re going to the temple, then disappears through the inner door, bounding up the stairs.\n\n\n I unfold the robes that I had taken off just moments ago, then slip them back over my head. I tie the sash around my waist, then let my head hang dejectedly. I didn’t think it would turn out like this. I just told my attendants that to get them to leave me alone, and it looks like that’s just made a whole lot of trouble for everyone.\n\n\n “…What did I do now, Lutz?”\n\n\n The subtle implications of phrases and the way that promises are made can change depending on what organization you’re part of. It’s such a simple, obvious thing. I knew it, but I didn’t understand it.\n\n\n Lutz pats me comfortingly on the head. “We don’t know anything about how the nobility work, do we?”\n\n\n “…Yeah.”\n\n\n “Sure, you messed things up this time, but use this opportunity to fix your weak points.”\n\n\n I tilt my head. “My weak points?”\n\n\n Lutz nods emphatically, looking at me with a little bit of strictness in his eyes.\n\n\n “Look, I know you love books more than anything else, and I know you’ve been wanting to read them for so, so long, but, before you can do that, you need to learn the way of life over there, which means you need to be asking everyone around you even the tiniest little questions you have.”\n\n\n “Their way of life?”\n\n\n “…Like, right now, there’s so much stuff I don’t know about the world of merchants. It’s all sorts of stuff that everyone around me thinks is obvious, but I’ve never heard of it before. So, I’ve been asking about everything I don’t understand, no matter how small it is. When I do that, then it doesn’t matter if it’s just the other apprentices or even Mister Mark, they’ll all teach me what I need to know. If you don’t put in the effort to ask, then you’ll never learn anything.”\n\n\n His words strike home. He’s a son of craftsmen, throwing himself into the world of merchants. I know full well just how hard he’s been having to work to get familiar with how things work in a shop. Despite knowing that, even after finding myself in basically the exact same situation of having thrown myself into the unknown world of the temple, I’ve been putting no effort into learning anything about the common knowledge of the temple, even beyond just wanting to spend my time reading books instead.\n\n\n “I’m planning on working as hard as I possibly can so that I can live as a merchant. If you want to go to temple and read books, then first off, you need to learn how they do things at the temple. It’s gonna be okay, though. I know you can do it. You’re really smart!”\n\n\n “I’m not, though! I’m always so thoughtless. You’re way smarter than I am.”\n\n\n There’s no way that I’m actually smart. Just like Benno always says: I’m thoughtless. I’ve got a bunch of prior knowledge, sure, but I wouldn’t say any of that makes me smart.\n\n\n “Yeah, sure, but even if you’re thoughtless, you’re still the kind of person who can always blast your way forward towards your goal, right? So, if your goal is to be able to read books without anything bothering you, then you’ll be able to do whatever you need to make that happen, right? You just need to work hard to make sure you can read your books in peace.”\n\n\n “Ngh… you know me too well.”\n\n\n As soon as I start thinking a little more about the future, I hear the clatter of footsteps coming down the stairway. The door creaks open and Mark steps through. He’s wearing a long-sleeved garment that seems like it’s been made from a material light enough to still keep him cool.\n\n\n “I am sorry to keep you waiting,” he says.\n\n\n Unlike his usual work clothes, the sleeves on his white coat are long and fluttering, with enough extra cloth hanging from them that it almost reminds me of a long-sleeved kimono1. The hems of the coat are embroidered, primarily with blue thread, and hang low, reaching down to his knees. Beneath that, he wears a comparatively crisp set of slender trousers. The overall outfit gives me the impression of a much more extravagant version of the nice clothes kids wear to their baptismal ceremonies. The quality of the material is much nicer too, so it’s clear to me that this is clothing worn when dealing with the nobility.\n\n\n “Thanks for waiting,” says Benno, coming down the stairs shortly afterward.\n\n\n The sleeves on Benno’s large, white coat are even longer than Mark’s, and the hem of his coat falls all the way down at his ankles. The quality of the embroidery on his coat is leagues above that of Mark’s. On top of his coat, he wears a thin cloak, clasped shut at his shoulder by a golden brooch, set with a blue gemstone. In his hand, he carries something that looks like a flower. He’s also put some sort of pomade in his usually quirky, milk tea-colored hair, fixing it in place. He looks like an entirely different person.\n\n\n The sudden reminder that interacting with the nobility requires so much attention to be paid to even such things as clothing causes my throat to run dry. I’m gripped by the terrifying realization that I have just blundered my way into a world I know nothing about. I shouldn’t have said anything to drag anyone else into this mess with me.\n\n\n “I’m really sorry, Mister Benno,” I say, as I rush over to him. “I didn’t know that I’d get you caught up in all this…”\n\n\n “Don’t worry about it,” he says, grinning his usual fearless grin. He holds up the flower ornament. “This is a new model,” he says, then sticks it in my hair next to my usual chopstick.\n\n\n “My motto is that you find your best opportunities in your biggest predicaments. If we can safely deliver your donation while comporting ourselves as we should around the nobility, then that’s an opportunity for us to demonstrate just how quick and thorough the Gilberta Company’s services are. Let’s go.”\n\n\n Benno’s confidence is no lie. I have no idea what sort of chain of command there is in the store, but in the time Benno and Mark were out getting changed, the employees assembled a small wooden jewelry box with my donation inside, a roll of cloth, a small jar, and three cloth-wrapped packages. Then, when we go outside, there is already a horse-drawn carriage waiting for us, big enough to fit four adults, with sharply dressed coachmen waiting for us to embark.\n\n\n When did this happen?!\n\n\n As I stare, dumbfounded, Benno lifts me up, much more courteously than usual, and helps me into the carriage. As I look around the obviously expensive carriage, my stress level only starts to rise. When I worriedly look up at Benno, though, he flicks me in the forehead.\n\n\n “Right now, you’re a noble. I know what I’m doing, so I’ll make it all work out, but what I need you to do, no matter what happens, is to not get flustered. Just smile. Be dignified. And never hang your head. Can you do that?”\n\n\n “…I will do that,” I respond.\n\n\n Through the window in the carriage, I see Lutz yelling something to me. I can’t hear it, but his lips are easy to read. “You can do it,” he says. I nod back, as exaggeratedly as I can so that he can see.\n\n\n Mark climbs on board and shuts the door behind him then, after a moment, the carriage starts slowly moving forward. The clattering of the wheels matches the unsteady rhythm of my heart as we head off towards my first encounter with noble society.\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. The coat more specifically reminds her of furisode, a style of kimono with long, voluminous sleeves."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The cart stops at the entrance to the temple, and the coachman steps down. I can hear them saying something to the watchmen standing at the gates.\n\n\n I stand up from my seat, getting ready to get out, but Benno, not saying a word, holds me back. I look blankly up at him, he slowly turns his head away, still staying silent. I guess that he’s trying to tell me to sit down and stay quiet, so I give him a small nod, sitting back down, a little heavily, in my seat.\n\n\n Urgh, my heart’s pounding.\n\n\n I have no idea about what’s happening now, and even less of one about what might be happening soon. I can’t stop shivering anxiously. I clench my fists tightly, looking around the inside of the carriage. Mark seems to be making use of the fact that the carriage has come to a stop to write something.\n\n\n Mark, noticing that I’m looking at him, lifts his head to show me a calming smile. I try to smile back, but my face is a little too stiff, and it comes across as more of a grimace. Mark covers his mouth, trying not to laugh. I still don’t know if it’s okay for me to break this silence, so I scowl at him, puffing out my cheeks angrily. Benno, from next to me, pokes me in my puffed-up cheeks. It’s as if they’re ridiculing me for being the only person here who’s nervous about this whole situation.\n\n\n After a little while, the carriage rocks slightly as the coachman climbs back on board. Mark quickly puts away his pen and ink, then hands Benno the paper he’d been writing on. Benno looks it over, then grins broadly. I lean over, trying to see what’s written on it, but in that moment the carriage starts moving again. When the clattering of the carriage’s wheels fills the cabin, Benno starts to speak.\n\n\n “At this gate, visitors introduce themselves and request for their presence to be announced, then the gates are opened for them. When we get off, Mark will go first, then me, then you. You’re going to take my hand and step down slowly. Absolutely do not just jump off, and don’t lose your footing on the steps.”\n\n\n By “don’t jump off,” he must be referring to the time that Lutz and I rode in the guild master’s carriage. (To get down, we’d leapt off in unison, yelling “woo!” as we flew.) I was already worried about being so tense that I’d miss the stairs, too. I look off sheepishly off to the side.\n\n\n “Since they’ve gone and announced our presence, I’m betting that your attendants are going to be beyond that gate too. When we’re walking to the head priest’s office, I want the guy that he assigned to you in front, then me and you, and then Mark and your other attendants should follow behind us, carrying our gifts.”\n\n\n I’d honestly just planned on handing the head priest the money and saying “here’s my donation!”, but it looks like this has gotten exaggerated far beyond that. If I’d just brought the money by myself, I can’t even imagine what kind of rude blunders I’d make.\n\n\n “So, the box with your donation in it is something that you had me carry. When we get to the head priest’s room, open it up and look inside to check its contents, and then thank me for my troubles.”\n\n\n “Huh? How? Like, ‘thank you’, or 'I appreciate the effort’, or something like that?”\n\n\n “Something more noble-like would be better, but, well, that’ll work too.”\n\n\n What would noble words of thanks sound like? “I appreciate what a laborious task this must have been.” But that sounds way too self-important, though!!\n\n\n I hum thoughtfully to myself while I dig through my memories. I can remember medieval legends and poetry collections, but not only would that sound way too theatrical, if I’m talking to someone who isn’t just quoting lines out of a book, being able to recite memorized lines isn’t going to cut it. If I were talking to a merchant, then I’d be able to pull out the various phrases I learned from books on business manners, but I feel like that’s not quite what a noble would sound like.\n\n\n In the end, I dredge up my memories of what pampered rich girls sound like and try them out.\n\n\n “Ummm… I am grateful from the bottom of my heart that you so willingly undertook my request, as difficult as it may have been… something like that?”\n\n\n “And where did you learn how to talk like that?!”\n\n\n Benno stares at me, his eyes wide in absolute shock. I can’t figure out if that was too overbearing, or if it was just right, or if it just failed altogether.\n\n\n “So… no good, then?”\n\n\n “…No, that’s perfect. Try to keep talking like that until we get back to the carriage.”\n\n\n I bite down on a cry of disbelief, my face contorted into a nervous grimace. I am currently, most likely, the furthest possible thing from the image of an elegant rich girl. I force myself to take a slow, deep breath, straightening my back.\n\n\n “I understand,” I reply, as smoothly as I can.\n\n\n Shortly thereafter, the carriage passes through the gates, and we come to a stop within the grounds of the temple. The door is opened for us by our coachman, and Mark steps out first. Next is Benno. Finally, I step forward to stand in the doorway.\n\n\n The scene that I see when I look out the door is entirely unlike the temple I know. It seems like the entrance that carts stop at might be the temple’s true front entrance. This entrance appears to be for the exclusive use of the nobility and the very wealthy, with ornate sculptures and carvings made from a variety of materials placed amidst green gardens bursting with flowers. The mouth of the entryway itself is decorated with colorful tile in much the same way as the front wall of the hall of worship.\n\n\n The entrance that I’ve been using up until now, the one that leads straight from the main road, seems to be the entrance used by the commoners who arrive on foot. Compared to this, it seems like it’s just the back door. There is a strict separation between the dull monochrome of that world and the vivid color of this one. The scene before my eyes is a harsh reminder that there are a lot of stark differences that I just don’t know about.\n\n\n For a temple, a place that purports itself to be a house of the gods, to be so sharply different even just at its entrance is something that I couldn’t have even imagined. When the unexpected evidence of this clear disparity hits my eyes, my heart freezes.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, your hand…”\n\n\n Benno’s voice snaps me out of my trance, and I hold out my hand. I glance down at my feet, worried about falling, and in that moment he grabs my hand tightly and picks me up.\n\n\n “Don’t look down,” he says in a quiet voice, his smile unwavering. A cold sweat runs down my spine, and I smile broadly back, nodding. One of the key points that he had explained to me was “even if you don’t have any confidence in yourself, don’t lower your head”, but it seems like that extends to a ban on looking down for any reason at all.\n\n\n He gently sets me down, more courteously than I could ever imagine him doing under normal circumstances. Fran quickly approaches.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne,” he says.\n\n\n “Master Benno,” I say, “This is one of my attendants. Fran,” I continue, looking up at him with a slight tilt to my head, “might I perhaps be able to request a meeting with Father Ferdinand?”\n\n\n A look of astonishment flashes briefly over Fran’s face, then he smoothly crosses his hands before his chest and bows slightly.\n\n\n “Preparations are already underway,” he replies.\n\n\n “Madam Ma?ne,” says Mark, “who might I be able to ask for assistance with bringing Master Benno’s gifts to the head priest?”\n\n\n A tiny jolt of panic shoots through my heart, and I glance back at him over my shoulder. When I slowly look around the area, I see neither Gil nor Delia nearby. I can’t decide if I should be worried that I don’t have them to help carry things or relieved that they’re not here to make trouble for me. Either way, I have no idea what the correct answer to this particular problem is, so I decide to pass the burden onto Fran.\n\n\n “Fran, might I ask you to find a few trustworthy individuals to assist me?”\n\n\n “As you wish,” he replies.\n\n\n Even though I’d just shoved a bunch of work onto him, he immediately nods and starts quickly carrying out my request. No look of dissatisfaction, no “but\"s, just the smooth acknowledgement of an excellent attendant fulfilling his master’s request.\n\n\n I tilt my head in blank confusion. Why is he behaving so differently all of a sudden? Literally the only thing that’s different between this morning and now is the fact that I’m talking differently…\n\n\n And then it hits me. Fran finds it very important that I speak like a noble.\n\n\n I’d been irritated that he seemed to only have eyes for the head priest, but at the same time, he resented the fact that I didn’t seem to be even the slightest bit noble. If I want him to feel good about the work that he’s doing, then what I’ve been doing isn’t good enough. Just like Lutz said, I need to put a ton of effort into learning how nobles speak and act.\n\n\n Fran calls over several gray-robed priests and starts directing them to carry the gifts, splitting the work between them. After checking to ensure that nothing was left behind, he says, \"please, this way,” and begins to lead the way. Unlike this morning, when a vague air of dissatisfaction had followed him around as we walked, he seems lively now, as if he’s very much in his element.\n\n\n Benno gives me a look, silently urging me onwards, and I start following him. Just as we’d discussed, everyone falls into place as Benno had described. However, Fran is an adult, and his brisk pace is rather difficult to keep up with. As I frantically move my feet as quickly as they can go to keep up, Benno speaks up, unable to keep quiet about the situation.\n\n\n “Aren’t you going a bit fast?” he says.\n\n\n Fran looks over his shoulder. “I beg your pardon?” he says, blinking.\n\n\n “Madam Ma?ne is your master, isn’t she? I’m well aware that you were only just assigned to her this morning, but if you don’t pay attention to how quickly you’re walking, she’s going to collapse. So, this might be a bit impertinent of me to ask, but would you maybe keep an eye on your speed?”\n\n\n “…My sincere apologies.”\n\n\n Fran looks ashamed that Benno, a visitor, had been the one to point that out. Really, I as his master should have been the one to ask that. He immediately starts to apologize, but I realize that if I let him do so then I would be failing my obligations as a noble.\n\n\n “Master Benno, I apologize for making you worry. Fran is an excellent attendant, assigned to me by the head priest himself. I have no doubt that he’ll adjust quickly. Your concern is appreciated, but unnecessary.”\n\n\n “Alright,” he replies. “How about, for today, Mark carries you, since he is already accustomed to you? It would be rather problematic if you lost consciousness today, as you have before.”\n\n\n Glancing up at Benno, it’s very easy to see what’s written on his face: “you’d better not pass out on me in the middle of the corridor after we’ve come this far”. Mark hands the cloth-wrapped bundle he’s been carrying to Fran, then, with a courteous apology, gently lifts me up in his arms.\n\n\n Eeek! In a princess carry?!\n\n\n I choke down a shout over having picked up in an entirely different way than I’m used to. Elegantly, elegantly, I repeat to myself, putting on the most elegant smile I can muster.\n\n\n “Fran, if you will,” I say, gesturing down the corridor.\n\n\n “Of course, Sister,” he replies.\n\n\n When the head priest’s room comes into view, Mark lets me down, takes his bundle back from Fran, then steps back to rejoin the squadron of gift-bearers. Fran, despite the fact that the head priest’s room is literally right in front of us, constantly checks over his shoulder as we walk, making sure that he’s matching my walking speed. I smile and nod back at him, trying to silently convey that his speed is fine. A look of obvious relief crosses his face.\n\n\n Unlike the temple master’s room, no priests stand guard outside the high priest’s room. When Fran reaches the unattended door, he retrieves a small bell from his sash, then rings it once. I’ve only ever seen doors like this opened after someone calls out to the gray-robed priest next to the door, who then opens the door for them, but this time, he opens the door himself after a single ring of the bell.\n\n\n I start heading towards the door as it swings open, but Benno squeezes my shoulder to get me to stop. I glance at the other people around me and see that everyone is patiently standing by. It seems like we mustn’t start entering until the door is completely open. I step back to my previous position, keeping a perfectly straight face as if nothing at all had happened, and wait for the door to finish opening.\n\n\n Beyond the door are two gray-robed priests. The head priest sits at his desk, with Arnaud standing beside him. Fran enters the room, stopping in front of the reception table. Seeing that, I stop as well. Benno and Mark stop behind me, and the squadron of gift-bearers spreads out along the wall.\n\n\n Benno smoothly takes a single step forward, sinking down onto his left knee much like I did during my ceremony of vows, then gently bows his head.\n\n\n “On this brilliant day, granted to us by the power of Leidenschaft, the god of Fire, the gods have guided me here. May they bless this auspicious meeting. …I believe this is the first time we have met, Father. I am Benno, the proprietor of the Gilberta Company. I am here today at the behest of Madam Ma?ne. I am most pleased to make your acquaintance.”\n\n\n Benno fluently recited the name of the god of fire as if it were the most obvious thing, but I still don’t actually remember them myself. I’m guessing that if I don’t learn the names of the gods that affect each season, I won’t be able to properly greet any nobility. When I think of what it’ll take just to be able to properly introduce myself, I can feel the blood start to drain from my face. I suddenly realize just how important the task of memorizing the scriptures that the head priest had given me really is. Learning how to deal with the nobility is going to be very difficult, it seems.\n\n\n “I grant you my blessing,” replies the head priest, “from the depths of my heart. May the guidance of Leidenschaft, the god of fire, pour down upon the Gilberta Company.”\n\n\n He raises his left hand over his heart, stretching his right hand before him until his fingers come to rest just above Benno’s head. A gentle blue light shines forth from his palm, and Benno’s pale hair, ordinarily the color of milk tea, is dyed blue. The light disappears quickly, but it’s plain for anyone to see that Benno has received a blessing.\n\n\n This unexpectedly solemn scene takes my breath away. That blue light must be mana, isn’t it? All I can do is force my mana out using my emotions, creating that coercion effect, but if I’m taught how to use it, could I give blessings like that? Or, rather, since I’m an apprentice priestess, am I going to be expected to be able to give blessings like that?\n\n\n The list of things I need to keep track of in my head just keeps on growing. Lutz’s words prickle in the back of my mind: I have a lot I need to do before I can read my books.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne,” says Fran. “Please, may I offer you a seat?”\n\n\n His voice snaps me back to reality. I can see that he’s already moved next to the head priest’s reception table. Now that I think of it, given my social standing here, if I don’t move, I’m pretty sure that nobody else can.\n\n\n I walk over to the chair that Fran guides me to. That, at least, poses no difficulty. However, since I’m basically only as large as a five-year-old, whenever I need to sit in a chair, I have to climb up onto it. Ordinarily, this poses no problem at all, but today, that just won’t do.\n\n\n I didn’t think of this! How the hell do I sit gracefully on a chair that’s too tall for me? What would an elegant rich girl do in this situation! Do I just make an “oh, bother” pose and hope for the best?!\n\n\n I stare at the chair, at a loss for what to do next. Then, not entirely sure whether or not this would actually convey what I want it to, I lift my right hand, resting my index finger on my face, then bring my left hand up to my right elbow as I would if I were crossing my arms. I look up at Fran, tilting my head slightly to the side.\n\n\n I stand like that for about three full seconds.\n\n\n “…Pardon me, Sister,” says Fran, picking me up and sitting me down in the chair.\n\n\n Oho! It went through?!\n\n\n I smile brilliantly at Fran as he pushes my chair in. A faint, almost wry smile tugs at the corners of his mouth.\n\n\n By the time I look away from him, Benno’s already taken a seat next to me. Behind him stands Mark, and, across the table, behind the high priest stands Arnaud. Fran must be standing right behind me as well. The gift-bearing priests are still lined up against the wall.\n\n\n “Madam,” says Benno, to me, “here is the item that you requested I bring for you. Is this to your satisfaction?”\n\n\n He reaches towards me, holding out the ornately carved wooden jewelry box he has been carrying in both hands this entire time. He opens the box, showing me its contents. Inside are five small gold coins. This is the first time I’ve ever seen a gold coin. I spend a moment staring at their dazzling sparkle, then thank Benno for his effort, just as we practiced.\n\n\n “Master Benno, I am grateful from the bottom of my heart that you so willingly undertook my request, as difficult as it may have been.”\n\n\n “It was no great trouble at all,” he replies.\n\n\n He sets the box down on the table, leaving the lid open, and presents it to the head priest.\n\n\n “Father,” he says, “this box contains Madam Ma?ne’s donation. Please accept this offering.”\n\n\n “…Hm, this is indeed all in order. Ma?ne… also, Benno. I appreciate what a laborious task this must have been.”\n\n\n The head priest looks into the box, verifying its contents, then closes it. He hands it to Arnaud, who carries it off somewhere, most likely to where they keep their coin for safekeeping.\n\n\n “Additionally,” says Benno, “I would like to offer you these gifts of my own, as a token of my thankfulness to you.”\n\n\n With these words, the gray-robed priests lining the walls step forward, placing their bundles on the table. Mark moves to down his bundle as well. The head priest looks over them, frowning.\n\n\n “I’d understand if this were a greeting, but thankfulness? I don’t think I’ve done anything you’d be thankful for.”\n\n\n “It is through your good graces that Ma?ne’s Workshop will be able to continue operating. It is this for which I am most deeply thankful.”\n\n\n Benno crosses his hands before his chest, casting his eyes downward. “Ah, I see,” murmurs the head priest. Benno then starts to introduce the head priest to the items he’s brought.\n\n\n “This cloth is of the highest quality that my shop has to offer. This, here, is called rinsham. While I presently hold all of the rights to its production, this product was originally produced by Ma?ne’s Workshop. This, here, is a product of her workshop as well: a plant-based paper, which we are only just beginning to sell.”\n\n\n “Hmm…!”\n\n\n The thing that seems to have caught the head priest’s interest the most is the plant-based paper. He picks up a sheet, feeling its texture.\n\n\n “I would like to dedicate these gifts to you, Father, as well as to the Reverend, the master of this temple, who it seems could not be here with us today. I would also like to dedicate these to Madam Ma?ne, through whose good graces has allowed this meeting to occur.”\n\n\n Huh? Me?!\n\n\n I can’t stop my eyes from widening in shock, but I at least manage to stop myself from saying anything out loud. The two of them, paying no attention as I force down my surprise, continue their conversation.\n\n\n “These are excellent gifts. You have my gratitude.”\n\n\n “I am deeply delighted that they have pleased you, Father.”\n\n\n The head priest glances at the gray robed priests. “Put these gifts on the shelves, if you would.”\n\n\n At his word, they begin to put everything away. Mark helps to hand things to them as he wraps the paper back up in its cloth.\n\n\n Ahh… it’s over.\n\n\n My donation has been delivered, the gifts have been received, and so our business today has gone off without a hitch. The moment I let out a small sigh of relief, however, Benno’s hand moves nimbly under the table, lightly tapping against my leg.\n\n\n I turn to look at him, tilting my head curiously. He looks back at me, copying my surprised expression. He smiles a fake smile, then makes a show of glancing down. Careful not to bow my head, I glance down as well, and see that there’s a small scrap of paper tucked between his fingers.\n\n\n I quietly reach out to take the paper, suddenly hit with nostalgia. What schoolkid hasn’t passed notes like this during class? I, personally, exchanged a few notes like this with girls before, but I never got any notes from boys. Benno is more than a little too old to be called a boy, but this is the first time I’ve ever gotten a letter from someone of the opposite sex. I know it’s just Benno, but I can’t help but get a little bit excited as I unfold the paper.\n\n\n When I casually glance under the table, taking care to keep it hidden, written there on the paper, in neat writing, is “stay sharp, idiot.”\n\n\n You got me excited over this?!\n\n\n The head priest looks at me, perhaps having noticed that my elegant demeanor suddenly slipped. I frantically paste a smile on my face, but it might have been slightly too obvious, as his expression suddenly changes. I straighten myself, swallowing, as the head priest holds his hand out to the side, gently waving it. The gray robed priests, seeing this, all cross their hands over their chests, bowing gently, then file out of the room one by one.\n\n\n “While we have this opportunity,” he says, “I have a few questions I’d like to ask of you, Benno.”\n\n\n The head priest’s face grows tight. He looks at Benno with sharp eyes that seem to brook no lies nor deceit. At the same time, the feeling that Benno is giving off suddenly grows much sharper than it did before.\n\n\n It seems like this is the start of the real conversation. I sit up ramrod straight, clutching Benno’s reminder to “stay sharp, idiot” in my fist."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The gray-robed priests bow, then file one by one out of the room. Arnaud, meanwhile, has managed to produce a small cart from somewhere. He then fills a thick glass bowl with tea leaves, likely the head priest’s favorite. As the tea starts to steep, he turns towards me, pulling out glass jar after glass jar full of tea leaves, describing their variety, the region from which they came, and the season during which they were picked.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, which of these may I serve you?”\n\n\n …Honestly, I have no idea.\n\n\n “That one seems quite excellent,” I reply, pointing at one that looks good enough. Next, however, comes the question of what milk I would like put in it. Again, he sets out a series of jars, asking me if I had any preference for the farm or the breed of cow.\n\n\n …I honestly, truly, seriously, have no idea.\n\n\n However, because of my social status, I must be the first to choose. I can’t just let Benno pick and then ask for what he’s having. Suddenly aware of how terrifying even drinking tea is for the nobility, I glance over my shoulder at Fran and employ my new secret technique of passing all my work onto him.\n\n\n “Fran, which milk do you think would best suit this tea?”\n\n\n “Let me see… I would recommend the milk from the three-year old Glauvache from Holger. It carries a gentle sweetness that would best complement the flavor of tiphgaft.”\n\n\n “Alright. Then, might I try the Glauvache from Holger?”\n\n\n The tea I’m drinking today is tiphgaft. I’m having it with the milk of a Glauvache from Holger. I have no idea when I’m going to need to know this, but I’m going to remember it. As I chant it to myself, wondering what mnemonic I’ll need to actually remember it, I can’t stop my head from tilting thoughtfully to one side. Arnaud, meanwhile, asks Benno what kind of tea he might like. As he does so, the last of the gray-robed priests finishes exiting the room.\n\n\n “Your tea, Sister,” says Arnaud.\n\n\n “You’re much too kind,” I reply.\n\n\n I carefully pick up the glass cup, careful not to make a sound, and take a sip. The mild flavor of this particular blend of tea fills my mouth, mingling with the gentle sweetness of the milk. Everything from the ingredients to the brewing must have been amazing. It’s almost entrancingly delicious.\n\n\n Arnaud, having finished serving everyone’s tea, wheels the cart away to tidy up. As soon as I realize he’s gone, he reappears, firmly closing the door to the room. I watch his crisp, vigorous movements, in awe at how he avoids wasting even a single step. He takes his place behind the head priest, who then begins to speak.\n\n\n “Benno, you were among the first to support Ma?ne, weren’t you? From my reports, I am told you have an excellent eye.”\n\n\n “I am flattered, sir.”\n\n\n “What does that discerning eye of yours tell you about Ma?ne? There are certain members of the clergy who view her as a dangerous person who lets her mana run rampant. What is your opinion, as someone who knows her well, of her character?”\n\n\n “Letting her mana run rampant…? Ah, that…”\n\n\n Benno glances at me, not even the faintest trace of a smile in his eyes. I’m pretty sure that if we were anywhere else, he’d be thundering “and you didn’t tell me, huh?!”. I meet his gaze evenly, lifting my cup to my mouth.\n\n\n “I am but a mere merchant,” he says. “As such, I don’t know much about the intricacies of magic. I can, however, describe the Ma?ne that I know.”\n\n\n “Hm,” says the head priest, leaning forward interestedly. “Please, continue.”\n\n\n I suddenly feel like I’m back in elementary school, sitting in on a parent-teacher conference. I force myself to sit quietly, but what I really want to do is run right out of the room, yelling “No, stop! Don’t say anything! Not in front of me!”\n\n\n “Madam Ma?ne is a genius, at least in terms of her faculty towards bringing new products into being. She is without equal in conceptualizing these products, but ultimately the boy who makes her ideas reality is an apprentice at my humble shop. Over the course of working on her inventions, she has shown only mild recognition of her own genius. Ultimately, I believe that she has a gentle, tolerant character, as do others at my shop.”\n\n\n I’m going to guess that “gentle and tolerant” is how he sanitizes “absent-minded, thoughtless, and oblivious” for a noble audience. I honestly never thought I’d hear Benno describe me that way. I guess that old adage holds true: it’s not what you say, it’s how you say it.\n\n\n “Hold on,” says the head priest. “Putting aside ‘gentle’, what do you mean by 'tolerant’?”\n\n\n The head priest frowns deeply, looking between me and Benno with extreme doubt. This is a natural reaction, I think. I did, in fact, let my mana run berserk, causing the temple master to faint in front of a fair number of priests. I’m sure this has gained me some notoriety. On top of that, since the head priest is getting reports on my behavior from Fran, he probably knows that I released my mana in order to drive off Gil while he was interrupting my reading time. So, from the head priest’s viewpoint, I am definitely the furthest thing from “tolerant”. He probably thinks I’m dangerous, liable to let my magic explode at the slightest provocation.\n\n\n “There are things which she refuses to surrender… those would be her family, her friends, and, also, books. As long as nothing threatens to affect those, Madam Ma?ne is tolerant to an astounding degree. She lacks a strong sense of vigilance, and when she is deceived, she largely does not learn from experience. An apprentice at my shop who knows her quite well would likely describe her less as tolerant, and more as indifferent.”\n\n\n When he says that, I hear Fran mutter “indifferent… I see,” from above me. I think back on my actions this morning, realizing that I really have no room to complain.\n\n\n The head priest hums thoughtfully, looking at me. He hums again.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, is there anything else? If you’ll let your mana run rampant over anything besides your family, your friends, or books, tell me.”\n\n\n “I cannot think of anything at this moment that I would find quite as precious to me,” I reply.\n\n\n “Very well,” he says, nodding, looking slightly relieved.\n\n\n After momentarily looking up towards the ceiling, mulling over Benno’s words, the head priest exchanges a look with Fran.\n\n\n “Ah,” says Fran. “If I may, Master Benno, might I ask you to share with Father Ferdinand whatever information you have on Ma?ne’s exceptional feebleness?”\n\n\n “Feebleness?” says the head priest, glancing at me. “Ahh, the reason why she requires someone to monitor her physical condition.”\n\n\n I notice Fran tremble slightly in agitation. It seems like he’s remembering how Benno had taken him to task back in the corridor.\n\n\n “Madam Ma?ne has an astonishing lack of physical strength and stamina,” replies Benno. “If details such as her complexion, the amount she speaks, how quickly she walks, and how far she travels are not carefully monitored, then she runs the risk of suddenly collapsing, no matter how energetic she may appear. Afterwards, she is indisposed for several days as she recovers, often while feverish. As of now, I know none who are capable of monitoring her condition besides the apprentice of which I have been speaking.”\n\n\n “That apprentice is the boy named Lutz, I assume? …Fran, do you think you can do it?”\n\n\n When the head priests asks his question, the eyes of everyone in the room turn to Fran. His eyes dart agitatedly around the room for a moment, then he hangs his head ashamedly.\n\n\n “No, not yet… this is inexcusable.”\n\n\n When I glance back over my shoulder, seeing him towering above me, I notice that his fist is clenched so tight that his hand is trembling. I strongly sympathize with how awful he must be feeling, to not be able to meet the expectations of the man he looks up to so much.\n\n\n “Fran was assigned to be my attendant merely this morning,” I say. “To ask him to be able to understand my condition so quickly is to ask him to be able to do the impossible. Even Lutz had to spend many months together with me before he was able to completely recognize the warning signs.”\n\n\n “It would be problematic if it takes him that long,” says the head priest, blasting through my carefully-crafted followup with a single retort. “It is likely that the knightly order will be convened in the fall. Fran, you will need to be able to monitor her condition by then. Understood?”\n\n\n The head priest looks seriously at Fran, who inhales slowly, then replies with a crisp nod.\n\n\n “…As you wish, Father. I shall definitely learn how to do so by autumn.”\n\n\n Judging by the way he was able to take charge in the entranceway, and by how expertly he was able to judge the tea, it’s obvious that Fran is a kid who can put in tremendous amounts of effort if it’s for the head priest’s sake. I think that since he just received a direct order, he will tackle the task of learning how to manage my condition with utmost seriousness. If nothing else, I’m just happy that going forward at least one of my attendants will be interested in trying to maintain my health.\n\n\n Benno glances over as I quietly sigh in relief, then looks back at the head priest with a worried expression on his face.\n\n\n “Father, Madam Ma?ne is terrifyingly intelligent for a child of her age. However, she has little experience in society, and knows nothing of the knowledge common in the temple. Worse, she has lived a life very distant from noble society.”\n\n\n “Ah, I’m aware. Please don’t be worried. That’s why I’ve assigned Fran to her. He is one of the most excellent attendants on my staff. If she has any questions, he will be more than capable of answering them. Of course, I myself also intend to participate in her education.”\n\n\n Behind me, I can hear Fran’s breath catch in his throat. When I instinctively glance over my shoulder at him, I see that his eyes are wide with disbelief as he stares at the head priest.\n\n\n Huh? Did he maybe think that him being reassigned to be my attendant was a punishment for his lack of skill? If that’s the case, then does this mean that all I need to do to get him on my side is to say something like “let’s work together so that we can be useful to Father Ferdinand”?\n\n\n As I swallow another mouthful of tea, contemplating how I might win him over, the head priest glances back and forth between me and Benno, narrowing his eyes.\n\n\n “Incidentally, Benno. What does it mean when people say Ma?ne is your goddess of water? It seems that you care quite a lot for her, but are you really a man of such tastes?”\n\n\n Benno yelps, his cup falling from his fingers to crash hard onto its saucer. The head priest frowns concernedly, crossing one leg over the other as he watches Benno sink into obvious panic.\n\n\n “What kind of eyes do you look at Ma?ne with, I wonder? Please, tell me.”\n\n\n “What kind… you ask…? I, uh, myself, don’t really understand, why people around me, insist on saying that. Father.”\n\n\n It’s actually a little funny to see how flustered Benno is now despite usually being so composed, but I actually don’t understand what the head priest means when he’s talking about a “goddess of water”. Come to think of it, I do recall Otto saying something like that once and Benno getting angry about it.\n\n\n I tilt my head in confusion. “Um, I apologize for the interruption, but what might you mean when you are referring to a 'goddess of water’?”\n\n\n I look around the room for answers, but no matter who I look at, every single one of them refuses to meet my eyes. Everyone seems to be wishing that I’d ask someone else. This is an extremely uncomfortably awkward situation.\n\n\n When I tilt my head again, a troubled frown on my face, Benno slips me another note. “Be quiet,” this one says. I decide to interpret it as him telling me not to speak so loudly, so I turn to Fran and quietly whisper to him.\n\n\n “…This is a matter of the gods, so it is related to the temple, is it not? Fran, would you kindly tell me what it means?”\n\n\n “Ah, um, uhh…”\n\n\n Fran turns desperately to the head priest, hoping for help. Benno sighs, clutching his head in his hands. The head priest, making a sour face, reluctantly answers.\n\n\n “The person in his thoughts. His sweetheart. The one who makes his heart beat. Those are the typical meanings people use that phrase for.”\n\n\n The person in his thoughts? His sweetheart? No way. Benno is a man of principle who has remained a bachelor ever since his actual sweetheart died. Even still, if you look at me and Benno, it’s just weird to think anything like that could be happening.\n\n\n “…Well, Father, such a thing is simply impossible. Master Benno is old enough that he could be my father, after all.”\n\n\n I can’t hold back my objection. Benno, too, immediately latches on to what I say, adding his strong denial as well.\n\n\n “It is exactly as Madam Ma?ne says. It’s simply impossible.”\n\n\n The head priest looks at him, still frowning doubtfully. “It’s not uncommon for a man to marry someone young enough to be his daughter, right?”\n\n\n In Japan, back in my Urano days, I definitely heard stories about celebrities marrying people much younger than they were, but I haven’t heard anything like that since becoming Ma?ne.\n\n\n After all, even if it’s a second marriage, if someone were to marry someone young enough to be their child, then that person would wind up needing assistance from their spouse’s children in a lot of things. Plus, since this is effectively increasing the number of dependents in a family, this would definitely breed discord with the breadwinner’s children. And, of course, the world isn’t kind enough for the younger spouse to be able to live on their own earnings.\n\n\n “I’ve heard of nothing of the sort, though. …Ah, now that I think of it, perhaps such age differences are not uncommon here at the temple? One of my own attendants told me that she wishes to have such a relationship with the Reverend.”\n\n\n I’d tried to cover for Benno by implying that the head priest might be unaware of how us commoners live, but another strange silence falls around the room. Benno passes me another note, this one saying “please, shut up.” As requested, I shut my mouth, but now nobody is saying anything, and the silence is only growing more and more oppressive.\n\n\n “……”\n\n\n “……”\n\n\n “……”\n\n\n All we do is take frequent sips of our tea, exchanging questioning glances with each other. This is unpleasant. This is making me extremely uncomfortable.\n\n\n “…Father Ferdinand, I am aware that it is exceedingly impertinent for a servant such as myself to ask this, but may I be permitted to add a remark of my own?”\n\n\n The one to finally tear through this strange, heavy silence is Mark. The head priest looks up in surprise, and when he turns to Mark, it’s plainly written on his face that he doesn’t care who does something about this situation as long as somebody does it. He quickly raises both his hands.\n\n\n “I’ll allow it. What is it?”\n\n\n “I will confess that I am saying this in part because I would like to protect Master Benno’s good name, but I wish to clarify that the common meaning of 'goddess of water’ does not quite apply in this case. I am sure you are already aware of this, Father, but the commodities that Madam Ma?ne has been so continuously creating have spurred Master Benno into starting new enterprises. She has been causing new projects to bloom within a company that previously only worked in clothing and accessories. It’s perhaps more accurate to describe Madam Ma?ne as being the goddess of water not just for Benno, but our entire humble establishment.”\n\n\n “Hmm, is that what that means? I understand, then. Now, lastly, about Ma?ne’s Workshop…”\n\n\n He didn’t look like he particularly understood the answer he was given for the question he’d been the one to bring up, but he doesn’t press the subject any further, instead deciding to change the topic of conversation.\n\n\n “Just how much of your proceeds are you willing to donate? We agreed to discuss your promise of the portion of your profits we will be receiving, I believe?”\n\n\n Benno nods, hand on his chin, making a show of pondering the topic. His long, trailing sleeve drapes over his lap, and tucked in it I can see a number of little pieces of paper that already have things written on them.\n\n\n Are… those…?\n\n\n I suddenly realize that the pieces of paper that Benno has been passing me are the same notes that Mark had written during the cart ride here. My face stiffens with shock.\n\n\n M… Mister Mark?! Was it you that wrote “idiot” on that paper?! I thought you were a perfect gentleman! How could you come up with all of those mean words!\n\n\n I know he was just writing things down that Benno would want to say, but it’s still a massive shock to realize that he was the one to write things like “idiot” and “shut up”. I really wish he didn’t give me the same reassuring smile as always when he was writing all that, too.\n\n\n As I slump in my chair, Benno passes me another little piece of paper. “Keep your mouth shut,” this one says.\n\n\n “…It will depend on the product being produced,” he says, out loud, to the head priest. “I am sure you are aware of this, but it is not possible to guarantee a fixed amount of money at a fixed interval. In addition, we are currently in the process of developing new products, and we are still in a state where we are not presently making any profit, as we are continuing to pour money into our initial investments.”\n\n\n “That may be so, but—”\n\n\n “Considering the money that we must spend on maintaining the workshop and developing new products, I believe we should be able to donate ten percent of our net profits to the temple.”\n\n\n Benno interrupts the head priest, immediately presenting him with the figure of ten percent. The head priest frowns at the number.\n\n\n “Ten percent seems rather small, doesn’t it?”\n\n\n “…I apologize for my impertinence, but ten percent is actually almost an excessive sum. There are costs involved with the distribution of the finished product, the acquisition of the raw materials, and the salaries of our workers, none of which we can decrease.”\n\n\n “But you—”\n\n\n “There are times when one must still sell one’s products even if margins are slim, but I cannot imagine that you would wish for Ma?ne’s workshop to be forced to operate at a deficit, would you?”\n\n\n The head priest remains silent. He probably doesn’t want to place that burden on us. After all, the temple itself is currently running in the red.\n\n\n Also, it would be difficult for him to actually object. The temple gets its labor from the orphans in the orphanages, and its income comes from the lord of the land and the families of the blue-robed priests. The income and expenditures of the temple are fundamentally different than those of a business. I think the head priest might not have any idea how a shop is organized or what wages might be paid.\n\n\n “Madam Ma?ne is certainly free to donate as much of her own share of the workshop’s proceeds to the temple as she wishes, but there is little of the workshop’s income that could be donated to the temple without impacting its ability to do business.”\n\n\n “…I see. Ten percent it is, then.”\n\n\n Benno seized control of the conversation by constantly pressing the head priest for answers, and quickly established the amount I’d be paying to the temple. Benno’s share, of course, is thirty percent, so I can’t help but admire how he was able to so calmly keep the temple’s share down to ten. As I marvel at this turn of events, Mark smoothly retrieves a piece of contract parchment, spreading it out on the table.\n\n\n The instant terms were agreed on, he produces the contract. Mark’s role in this transaction is much more subdued than Benno’s, but he’s still amazing. He absolutely matches up to these attendants that have been trained to serve these blue-robed noble priests.\n\n\n Since the temple is an organization of nobles, the contract spread out on the table is, of course, a magical contract. The contract is quickly filled out, stating that ten percent of Ma?ne’s Workshop’s net profits would be donated to the temple, that the representative of the temple is the head priest, that the workshop’s head is myself, and that my guardian, who will be tasked with delivering the financial reports to the temple, is Benno. We each in turn sign the contract and seal it with our blood.\n\n\n Blood again?! I really hate contract magic…\n\n\n “Ma?ne,” says the head priest, “what are you staring at? It’s your turn.”\n\n\n Even after all this time, I still can’t get used to the idea of taking a knife to my own finger. At the head priest’s urging, though, I reach out with a trembling hand to pick up the knife. As I do so, someone from behind me gently reaches out to take it instead.\n\n\n “Please avert your eyes, Sister Ma?ne,” says Fran.\n\n\n “Fran…”\n\n\n I clench my eyes shut, and a sharp prick of pain shoots through my finger. When I cautiously open my eyes, a fat drop of blood is welling up on my fingertip. Fran holds the contract out for me, and when I press my finger against it the same golden flame as always ripples across it, burning it away into motes of light.\n\n\n “That is all I had to say today,” says the head priest. “This was a most fruitful use of my time. I thank you, Benno.”\n\n\n “Your gratitude is most unnecessary, Father.”\n\n\n As the head priest and Benno exchange their pleasantries, Mark neatly tidies up the implements for the contract magic, Fran clears the teacups and utensils from the table, and Arnaud spreads out a carpet.\n\n\n “Now, let us offer our prayers and our gratitude to the gods for their guidance in this meeting and in this contract.”\n\n\n He motions for Benno and I to come stand on the carpet. As we take our places, I look up at Benno and Mark, trying desperately to keep myself from laughing.\n\n\n So now Benno and Mark are going to do the Glico pose?! I need to see this! I really need to see this! But my sides will absolutely give out!\n\n\n My brain is already conjuring up the image of them lined up and posed perfectly. As I struggle valiantly to keep a straight face as that explosive image blasts through my brain, all of the strength suddenly leaves my body.\n\n\n “Hwah?!”\n\n\n An extremely unladylike noise emanates from my mouth. I fall with a thud to my knees, and after a moment, the weight of my head pulls my upper body down to the ground.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne?!” shrieks Fran from behind me.\n\n\n Everyone turns to look at me. The head priest lets out an amazed sigh, looking down at me as I lay there in a heap.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, get up, please. This is most unsightly.”\n\n\n The head priest didn’t need to tell me that. I’ve tried several times already to push myself back up, but I can’t move my arms. I can’t lift my head.\n\n\n …What the hell?\n\n\n “Umm, my body’s being weird. I can’t move anything right now. But I really don’t feel like I’m getting a fever. My hands and feet are actually feeling kind of cold. Mister Benno, what’s happening?”\n\n\n “Why would I know?!” he shouts. “Don’t ask me!”\n\n\n He stoops down to pick me up. I try to grab on to his clothes for support like I usually do, but I really can’t move my arms at all. They’re completely limp, hanging heavily from my shoulders. It’s like they’re not even my arms.\n\n\n “Father Ferdinand,” says Benno, “I cannot apologize enough for this disturbance. I beg your forgiveness, but I would be much obliged if we could cut our farewells short at this time.”\n\n\n “Th… That’s… that’s alright,” says the head priest, his face ghastly pale as he stares at me. “Take care of Ma?ne.”\n\n\n Benno quickly takes his leave. Even after all that, I still don’t feel any of the signs that I have a fever coming on. I actually feel comparatively cool. In fact, despite that it’s the start of summer, it feels like my body is quickly cooling off.\n\n\n Mark frantically finishes getting everything ready to leave, and Arnaud and Fran both step forward to open the door for Benno as he carries me out of the head priest’s room. Benno, however, walks a little too quickly and is forced to stop, clucking his tongue impatiently, as he waits for the door to finish being opened.\n\n\n Unlike when I usually collapse, I haven’t passed out. My arms and legs just feel a little weird as they dangle limply. As my heavy head jostles about, only one regretful thought flashes through my mind.\n\n\n …I didn’t get to see Benno and Mark do the Glico pose."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Benno strides quickly through the hallway, carrying me in his arms. The princess carry he’s holding me in leaves my head to dangle loosely, and every step he takes makes my head jerk violently. I feel like at this rate my brain’s going to wind up scrambled. I really wish he’d walk with a little less bounce.\n\n\n As I think that, I hear from behind me the footsteps of someone frantically chasing us down.\n\n\n “Master Benno, please wait!”\n\n\n That’s Fran’s voice. The next time my head flops back, most of his torso and the bottom of his chin enters my field of view. Walking half a step behind Benno, he calls out again.\n\n\n “Master Benno―”\n\n\n “What do you want? In case you can’t tell, I’m in a hurry.”\n\n\n Not only does Benno seem to have no intention of stopping, there isn’t the faintest shred of politeness in his voice as he snaps back in his usual tone. That bluntness makes Fran flinch for a moment, then he takes a deep breath, steeling his resolve.\n\n\n “Please, let me carry Sister Ma?ne.”\n\n\n “Nope. In a hurry.”\n\n\n “I am her attendant. I cannot let a visitor to our temple such as yourself bear my burden.”\n\n\n Hearing Fran refuse to back down against Benno leaves my heart fluttering in suspense, but Benno abruptly stops walking.\n\n\n “She can’t move, she’s tiny, and she’s heavy. Absolutely do not drop her.”\n\n\n “I am fully aware.”\n\n\n Benno kneels down, gently handing me over to Fran. Fran takes care to make sure my head rests securely against his shoulder, then stands back up. Now that he’s properly supporting my head, it’s no longer being jerked around.\n\n\n “Fran,” I say, “you’re really good at carrying people.”\n\n\n “I must ask that you refrain from speaking unnecessarily,” he replies, his tone a little sharp with anger.\n\n\n “I can’t move my body, but my head is clear, so it’s not a strain at all.”\n\n\n “…You are, however, not paying any attention to your manner of speech.”\n\n\n His words are tinged with worry. I manage a small smile. I’m a little embarrassed about how much he’s worrying for me, but at the same time, I’m a little happy, too.\n\n\n “Umm, so, when Delia and Gil are around, I won’t have the chance to talk to you alone. Can I ask you something since it’s just the two of us?”\n\n\n Because there might be other priests in the hallways, I keep my voice low so only he can hear it. Fran nods slightly, keeping his eyes fixed on the path forward.\n\n\n “By all means.”\n\n\n “Um, I still don’t know anything about how to be a noble at all, and I think that I’ve really been embarrassing you, but I’m going to try my hardest to learn as fast as I can, and I really want your help. I want to learn how to be useful to Father Ferdinand, and I think you want to be useful to him too, so could we work together on this?”\n\n\n From the way his arm tightens and his Adam’s apple moves up and down, I can tell that he just gulped in surprise.\n\n\n “That is my duty, after all. …I must beg your forgiveness for earlier. My guess as to Father Ferdinand’s intentions was incorrect, and I let my personal dissatisfaction influence my behavior to you.”\n\n\n “Huh? What do you mean, your ‘guess’? Did he not explain anything to you?”\n\n\n I’m dumbfounded. If he was assigned to me with no explanation at all, of course he’d be dissatisfied. He was an attendant in direct service of the head priest, and to be suddenly assigned to a mere apprentice priestess―and not even a noble, but a commoner, at that―would of course look like a demotion.\n\n\n “Father Ferdinand can never be sure of whose ears his words might reach, so he tends to speak very little as to avoid having his own words used against him. Even though he had cleared the room during our meeting, I was very surprised to hear him talk so much.”\n\n\n “Wait, no, no, it’s a big problem if your subordinates don’t know what you actually want. You didn’t know why you were assigned to me, and that hurt, right?”\n\n\n I honestly have no idea what the head priest’s situation might be that he has to act like that, but if he keeps making the people most loyal to him sad like this, then he’s not going to wind up with many allies at all.\n\n\n “That is certainly correct. My assignment to you felt to me as if I was as poor an attendant as Delia or Gil and that Father Ferdinand had no need for me.”\n\n\n “That’s not true! I don’t believe for a second that he was trying to get rid of you by assigning you to me.”\n\n\n As I whisper to him, I’m hoping to reinforce his loyalty to the head priest, but at the same time, I’m secretly hoping that this’ll get him to treat me a little nicer too.\n\n\n “Is that so, I wonder?”\n\n\n He phrased it as a question, but from the tone of his voice he’s fairly solidly rejecting the idea.\n\n\n “I think he thinks that he’s just lending you to me. After all, even though I’m supposed to be your new master, and even though Mister Benno, a guest, was right in front of him, he gave you a direct order, didn’t he? He told you to become able to manage my condition by fall. If I were a regular noble, wouldn’t that be extremely rude?”\n\n\n “…Hm, it would indeed be as rude as you say.”\n\n\n A hint of a wry smile tugs at his lips. Just about then, the doors of the temple’s entrance are opened for us. It looks like our carriage had literally just arrived moments before us. The coachman seems astonished at how quickly we’d arrived, his eyes darting back and forth in surprise.\n\n\n “Fran, hand her over,” says Benno, having already leapt into the carriage.\n\n\n Fran hesitates for a moment, then pass me up into Benno’s outstretched arms.\n\n\n “Might I accompany her as well?” he says, hesitantly.\n\n\n “No,” snaps Benno as he loads me into the carriage. “If you leave the temple looking like that, we’re going to get a whole lot of boring questions.”\n\n\n Fran blinks in confusion, looking down at his robes. He looks like he’d never imagined that he’d be rejected based on what he was wearing.\n\n\n “But, we priests don’t have any other―”\n\n\n “If you don’t care if they’re second-hand, I’ll get something ready for you for next time. Give up for today.”\n\n\n “I would be most grateful.”\n\n\n After thanking Benno, Fran, standing by the carriage, crosses his hands before his chest, bowing slightly.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, I shall earnestly await your safe return.”\n\n\n That sounded like how a servant might bid his master on her way out the door, but his unexpected words leave me panicking. I have no idea how I’m supposed to answer him. I’m still thinking that the head priest is Fran’s master, and I’m really a pretty terrible master for him. I didn’t think I’d be someone for whom he’d earnestly await.\n\n\n As I flounder, Benno leans down to whisper in my ear. “'I leave things to you in my absence.’ You should respond like that.”\n\n\n Even if I tell him that I’ll 'leave things to him in my absence’, what am I actually leaving to him? The temple’s not my home. I don’t have a room there. I still don’t even have any place there where I can say I belong. It would be so easy to reject that answer like that, but if Fran is telling me that he’ll be waiting for me, then I’ve got a vaguely uncomfortable feeling that that means that he is expecting that I, as his master, will return here.\n\n\n I take a deep breath, summoning my most masterly voice.\n\n\n “Fran, I leave things to you in my absence.”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n In the carriage, I’ve been laid out limply on the seat, my head in Benno’s lap. Benno wrapped me in his cape after removing the golden broach, and I can feel a little bit of warmth returning to my cold body. As I breathe a sigh of relief, I suddenly realize exactly what kind of situation I’m in. I force down a shriek.\n\n\n What the hell?! I’m totally sleeping in his lap!\n\n\n I can’t believe this. Not only was Benno the first man to pass me a secret note, he’s the first man, family excluded, whose lap I’ve ever rested my head on. This doesn’t count, right? There’s no romance here, so it doesn’t count, right?\n\n\n Since there’s no way I can actually change the fact that all my weight is currently pressing down on Benno’s leg, I have no choice but to just grit my teeth and bear with this extremely, embarrassingly awkward situation until we make it to the shop.\n\n\n In order to try to push away my frantic desire to run as far away from this situation as I can, I ask Benno a question, my words coming out maybe a little bit too quickly.\n\n\n “M… Mister Benno, do priests not have any street clothes?”\n\n\n “They don’t need them. It’s not weird at all that they wouldn’t have any.”\n\n\n He explains that generally the only time a priest leaves the temple to enter the rest of the city is to perform ceremonies. A gray-robed priest wouldn’t stand out quite as much as a blue-robed one, but even so, if one wanders aimlessly around the streets, then they’ll draw a lot of unwanted attention. On top of that, if a gray-robed priest were to be specifically following me around, then that’s only going to make me even more conspicuous.\n\n\n “So, then, ummm…”\n\n\n “Quiet, now,” he says in a soothing tone of voice, gently stroking my hair.\n\n\n He holds my cold hands in his, as if trying to give me some of his warmth. This is exactly what someone would do if their beloved sweetheart were to collapse. I earned basically zero experience points in this particular skill in my past life, so at this point I’ve left the realm of embarrassment and launched straight into sheer bewilderment. I have no idea how I should be reacting right now.\n\n\n Even if his phrasing was curt, if he’s doing this kind of thing unconsciously then people around us are going to get some really weird ideas!\n\n\n As if he’s reading my mind, Mark speaks up from his seat across from us, his eyes cast down sadly.\n\n\n “Master Benno, Ma?ne is not Liese. It’s all right.”\n\n\n “…I know that,” he replies, looking out the window. “I know that, so don’t just say it’s all right.”\n\n\n He doesn’t let go of my hands, though. Since he’s looking away from me, I can’t see his expression at all. But, no matter how he hides, it’s plain to see that this has hit him in a place that should never be hit. I think that when his lover died, she did so smiling, telling him it’ll all be alright.\n\n\n There’s nothing I can say, and I can’t muster the strength to hold his big, warm hands reassuringly, so we ride like that for a while until we reach the Gilberta Company.\n\n\n The instant that the coachman unlatches and opens the door, Mark leaps straight outside, pushing open the door to the shop and issuing instructions to the employees inside. Even though he’s clearly in a rush, he’s still showing every bit of his skill as a splendid butler. Benno lifts me up, still wrapped in his cape, and carries me inside. By the time we reach the back room, Mark has already had the employees carry in a couch for me.\n\n\n “Lutz, please come to the back office,” calls Mark.\n\n\n It seems like Lutz has been waiting for me here, doing work in the meantime. When Mark calls out for him in a much louder voice than normal, I can hear the clatter of his footsteps as he hurries over.\n\n\n Benno unwraps his cape from around me and lays me down on the couch. My arm falls limply to the side, but he lifts it up and rests it on my stomach. I’m surprised at how heavy my own arm is. Then, he gently spreads his cape over me, like a blanket.\n\n\n “Lutz, Ma?ne collapsed at the temple.”\n\n\n Lutz carefully studies my face, feeling my brow, the nape of my neck, and my hands, tilting his head in puzzlement.\n\n\n “Her color’s off like it usually is when she collapses, but she doesn’t have a fever. Her hands are actually kinda cold instead, huh? She just can’t move, huh… I’ve never seen anything like this. Hey, Ma?ne. What did you do today?\n\n\n At his prompting, I start going over the events of my long, long day.\n\n\n \"Ummm, I went to the temple, I had my rite of vows, I did my prayers and my dedications, I was assigned my attendants, the head priest gave me some explanations, then I read the scriptures in the library until you came to pick me up. I think you and Mister Benno know everything after that happened.”\n\n\n “What are 'dedications’?”\n\n\n “Ummm, putting mana in a votive tool.”\n\n\n My stomach suddenly growls, halfway through my explanation. Everyone in the room turns to look at my stomach.\n\n\n Now that I think of it, I skipped lunch, didn’t I? I forgot all about it until just now. I’ve been too stressed to remember it, but now that I’m thinking about it, I’m really hungry.\n\n\n “…Oh, I guess I’m hungry,” I say.\n\n\n The tension in the air suddenly slackens. Mark smiles faintly, turning to open the door leading upstairs.\n\n\n “If she doesn’t have a fever and is instead merely hungry, I don’t believe that her condition will suddenly worsen anytime soon. Master Benno, let us head upstairs to change. I shall bring something down for her to eat.”\n\n\n “Sure.”\n\n\n After the two of them disappear through the door, Lutz brings a chair over next to the couch. He sits down on it, scowling, looking like he’s not satisfied with my explanation.\n\n\n “How are you hungry at this time of day? What did you eat for lunch?”\n\n\n “I skipped it.”\n\n\n He tilts his head in wonder. “You skipped lunch? Why?”\n\n\n “I didn’t want to waste any book-reading time. I can go two days without eating if I’ve got a book to read.”\n\n\n The instant I say that, Lutz’s jade-colored eyes narrow dangerously, gleaming with a cold anger.\n\n\n “So, Ma?ne,” he says, his tone sharp. “When do you know that from?”\n\n\n “Huh? When…?”\n\n\n “Ever since you became Ma?ne, you’ve been trying to make books because you don’t have any, right? So, when did you figure out that you could go two days without eating if you’ve got a book? You sure that wasn’t from before?”\n\n\n “Ah…”\n\n\n When he says that, I break out in a cold sweat. Lutz knows that I’m not the real Ma?ne. I’ve got Urano’s memories. It’s exactly as he says. Going two days without food was something I did back in my Urano days. Ever since I became sick, feeble Ma?ne, the only times I’ve skipped meals were when I was too unwell to eat. I’d never skipped a meal of my own volition before.\n\n\n “Plus, when you say you used your mana, that means you consciously made your devouring fever move around, right? When you were almost about to die to the devouring, your temperature suddenly went really high, and then came back down just as fast, right? Wouldn’t using your mana do basically that, too?”\n\n\n “It’s different though. The dedication sucked the mana out from me by force. It’s not like how it usually happens, where the fever just thrashes around in me with nowhere to go.”\n\n\n “But the part where your mana is moving around is the same, right? So after you put that stress on your weak, frail body, you skip lunch, and then you keep wandering around like this? No wonder you collapsed! You’re so dumb!” he yells.\n\n\n He suddenly deflates, letting out a helpless sigh. He picks up my arm and makes me punch myself in the face. “You’re so cold, even though it’s summer,” he mumbles, looking at me like he’s about to cry.\n\n\n “You might have died. Don’t do this to me. If something like this happens every time I take my eyes off of you… my heart can’t take it.”\n\n\n I want to reach out to comfort him, but the only things I can move are my eyes and my mouth. It’s like my arms and legs have completely forgotten how to move.\n\n\n “I was so happy to be in the library that I totally forgot. I’m sorry, Lutz.”\n\n\n Tears well up in his eyes. He clutches my hand tighter, getting even angrier.\n\n\n “Don’t forget! It’s your own body, right?!”\n\n\n “What’s all this noise?” says Benno as he walks into the room. “Lutz, you’re yelling at a sick girl. Tone it down a bit.”\n\n\n It looks like he got changed quickly. He walks towards us, frowning at Lutz. Lutz jumps down from the chair to make room for Benno, letting go of my hand. As he steps aside, he vents his frustrations.\n\n\n “But Master Benno. She got really engrossed in reading, so she skipped lunch, and that’s why she collapsed. I—”\n\n\n “You utter imbecile!!” he roars at me.\n\n\n “Gyah?!” I squeak.\n\n\n Benno, having only just told Lutz not to yell at a sick girl, blasts out at me with a voice like a clap of thunder. Even though he’s yelling so loudly, I can’t run away. I can’t even cover my ears. All I can do is watch, with tears in my eyes, as he stands imposingly over me.\n\n\n “The reason why people with the devouring grow so slowly is because mana absorbs nutrition. Even knowing that, you used mana and then skipped a meal? What were you thinking?!”\n\n\n “I… I didn’t know that—”\n\n\n “It’s a fact about your own body! Care enough to gather some basic information, you moron!”\n\n\n “Y-y-yes sir!”\n\n\n What he’s saying is absolutely correct, but I have no idea how to gather any information about the devouring. I realize, though, that pointing that out would only throw fuel on the fire, so I keep my mouth shut.\n\n\n “Ma?ne,” says Mark, entering the room carrying a tray, “your inattention is hardly a new phenomenon, but please do pay more attention to your own body. Master Benno, I would ask that you as well refrain from yelling at a girl so sick she cannot even sit herself up.”\n\n\n Mark, his voice tender but his words not giving me any slack, sets the tray of tableware down with a clatter, then helps me sit up.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, do you think that you’ll be able to eat something like this?”\n\n\n It looks like bits of hard bread have been soaked in milk, making a kind of bread porridge you’d feed to a sick person, to which honey has been added. It looks sweet, and delicious.\n\n\n “Lutz,” he continues, “as I am helping her sit up, could you help feed her?”\n\n\n “I’m, uh, not very good at this, so I’m probably going to spill it on those robes, I think.”\n\n\n He points at the blue robes I’m wearing, a troubled expression on his face. Because this outfit is something that nobles wear, it’s made out of expensive, high-quality material. Spilling milk on it and having it get stinky would be a big problem. Another problem is that these robes are the type designed to be pulled on over one’s head. Since I can’t move at all, getting them off of me while holding me upright would be a huge undertaking.\n\n\n “I see, this is a conundrum, isn’t it.”\n\n\n “Mark, go get the hardened bits of honey. If we can’t get her moving on her own even a little bit, getting that robe off her is going to be a problem.”\n\n\n At Benno’s instruction, Mark retrieves a little nugget of crystallized honey. It’s hard and spiky, like konpeito1. As I roll it around my mouth, it gradually starts to dissolve, and I can feel the sweetness gradually spreading through my body.\n\n\n It really looks like skipping even just one meal left me seriously lacking in nutrition. By the time the lump of honey finishes dissolving away, I can feel a little warmth returning to my body. A few more are tossed into my mouth, and as I suck on them, Benno roughly scratches his head.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, did the head priest say anything about using your mana? Did he ask you if you were feeling okay, or tell you that something like this might happen…?”\n\n\n I think back to what he had said this morning.\n\n\n “Ummm, he said that I should only give my dedications as long as it doesn’t put a strain on my body. It made my body feel light and felt pretty refreshing, though, so I didn’t think it was a strain at all.”\n\n\n “Ah, I see. But, since you’ve had the devouring all of your life, you’re used to having your body full of mana, aren’t you? Could it be that when something you were used to having went away, it caused some sort of abnormality?”\n\n\n “…You might be right.”\n\n\n I concentrate my will, loosening the seal keeping my mana contained. I slowly, carefully let a tiny little bit of the heat flow through my body. I can immediately feel my cold fingers start to warm up. After I’m sure that I’ve filled up all the places that needed it, I seal everything back up tightly.\n\n\n “It looks like you were right,” I say. “My body’s getting a little warmer.”\n\n\n Lutz immediately interjects. “Make sure you don’t overdo it and get so hot that you pass out,” he cautions. He’s completely aware of what I might wind up doing.\n\n\n “…I think I’m doing okay.”\n\n\n Now that warmth has returned to my hands, I try to slowly clench and unclench my fist. It still feels very stiff, but at least it’s moving as I’m willing it to.\n\n\n When Benno sees this, he puts a hand on his chest, breathing a sigh of relief.\n\n\n “…Ma?ne, most of the information I have about the devouring is hearsay. You need to ask the head priest about mana. He’s young, but he’s pretty sharp for a blue-robed priest.”\n\n\n “…Huh? The head priest is young?”\n\n\n I blink a few times in bewilderment. Benno mutters something to himself about how hard it is to explain how young someone is to a kid like me.\n\n\n “He looks, what, twenty-two or twenty-three?” he says. “He comes across as inexperienced, like he hasn’t gone through a whole lot, so he might even be younger than that…”\n\n\n “No way! I thought he looked thirty! I don’t think he looks any younger than you, Mister Benno!”\n\n\n “Ma?ne,” he says, glaring at me with terrifying intensity, “that’s not something you say to someone’s face, now, is it?”\n\n\n I think I’ve struck a nerve.\n\n\n But, the head priest is very composed, he’s got a sort of dignity about him, he’s skilled at directing others, and he’s holding the rank of head priest. Doesn’t getting all that take a lot of time?\n\n\n As I hum thoughtfully to myself, I start moving my body this way and that, turning myself over in preparation for getting myself up. Unfortunately, due to the fact that not quite everything is in full working order, in the process of rolling over I fall right off the couch.\n\n\n “Ma?ne!” shouts Lutz.\n\n\n “What do you think you’re doing, you idiot!” yells Benno.\n\n\n “I was just thinking it was about time I got up…”\n\n\n All three of them get very angry at that.\n\n\n “You couldn’t even move a minute ago!” yells Benno. “How did you think that was going to turn out?”\n\n\n “Ah,” says Mark, “it seems you can’t be left alone even for a moment.”\n\n\n “Please,” begs Lutz, “just stay put!”\n\n\n They had all seemed relieved that I had recovered a little, but now their worry seems to be turning to anger. They crowd around me as I lie there on the ground, their anger rising off of them like an aura.\n\n\n “Lutz,” says Benno, “every time you get Ma?ne from the temple, talk to Fran, her attendant, and get a detailed report from him on the day’s activities, if she used mana or not, what she ate, and so on.”\n\n\n “A good idea,” adds Mark. “If her actions aren’t closely managed, then who knows just what might happen. As you can clearly see.”\n\n\n Benno taps his finger restlessly against the table, glaring at me with irritation. Mark, at first glance, seems to be smiling, but it’s a terrifying sort of smile that doesn’t reach his eyes at all.\n\n\n There’s no objection I can make, so I just meekly hang my head in shame.\n\n\n “You’re not fooling me with that expression,” says Lutz, quietly.\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n “If there’s a book in front of you, I don’t think anyone beneath you, not even your attendant, will be able to get your attention.”\n\n\n Lutz, who knows me the best out of anyone here, points his finger accusingly at me.\n\n\n “If, when I get that report from your attendant, he tells me that you got mad at someone for interrupting you when you were reading, or that you didn’t make sure to eat your lunch… then I’m going to march straight to the most important person in the temple and make them ban you from the library!”\n\n\n How could you do something so cruel!\n\n\n …It seems that, somehow, thanks to everyone’s help, even at the temple I shall be forced into living a healthy life.\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1.

    "content": " \n\n\n\n After filling my body with mana, I’m able to move enough to eat the bread porridge that Mark had made for me, which, finally, helps get me moving as well as I usually do.\n\n\n “Ma?ne,” says Benno, “do you want me to handle getting some street clothes for your attendants? You could do it yourself, too. What do you want to do?”\n\n\n “Where would I go to buy everyday clothing? The second-hand store my family usually uses isn’t going to work, I assume?”\n\n\n No matter how poor commoners may be, and no matter how hard it is to make new clothes from scratch, children (with the exception of me) are constantly growing up. They always need larger and larger clothes to wear, and at the same time, the clothes that they’re growing out of aren’t useful to them anymore.\n\n\n Our homes are already cramped, so there’s no room to let things that aren’t being used pile up. So, with the exception of our nicest, most expensive outfits, when a garment becomes unusable, then we take them to a second-hand clothing store to sell them. Then, at that same store, we purchase the next set of clothing. When we do that, we’re effectively only paying the price of the transaction, letting us acquire new clothes cheaply.\n\n\n Since the only real requirement is that they’re basically wearable for now, it’s only natural that they’re going to be stained. Patches should be thought of as decorations. Design? As if anything like that existed. The only things that matter are the strength and thickness of the cloth. Garments whose cloth has become too thin to be usable anymore aren’t sold, but are instead cut up for use as diapers or cleaning rags.\n\n\n “Idiot,” says Benno. “Don’t make them walk around the north side of town wearing anything like that.”\n\n\n My attendants will mostly be accompanying me between the temple and the Gilberta Company, so they’re going to be walking around the high-class northern side of town. There’s no way we’re going to get away with our street clothes making us look like we’re destitute.\n\n\n “I don’t know where a high-quality second-hand clothing store is,” I say, “and I also don’t know what kind of clothing would be appropriate for my attendants, so I’d greatly appreciate it if you’d take care of it for me.”\n\n\n “I’ll bring you along if you don’t have a fever tomorrow. While we’re at it, we’ve got to stop at the restaurant along the way to check in on how things are going. Come with me.”\n\n\n “Alright,” I say, nodding.\n\n\n Benno looks over at Lutz. “I know you’d usually have the day off tomorrow, but come with us, too.”\n\n\n “Understood,” he replies.\n\n\n “I’m sorry for dragging you into this,” I say.\n\n\n “No, it’s okay, I’ve been wondering where I could buy something other than my work clothes for cheap, so this is perfect.”\n\n\n It seems that since Lutz is going to continue coming with me to the temple, he wants some clothing to wear on his days off from work. Unlike our regular street clothes, the Gilberta Company’s apprentice clothing must be washed every day. Because apprentices interact with clients, they need to maintain clean personal appearances, and that starts with their clothing. However, if a garment is washed every time it’s worn, then, of course, it’ll start wearing out quickly. Even though Lutz doesn’t want his apprentice’s clothes to wear out, he doesn’t have anything else he can wear when walking around the north side of town.\n\n\n “If I don’t have anything other than my work clothes to wear, then it’s going to get to the point where I’ll need a new set made, right?”\n\n\n Hearing that makes me think that I’d like some clothes for myself, too. Just like him, I don’t have anything to wear but my apprentice’s clothes if I want to go to the north side of town.\n\n\n “Mister Benno,” I say, “please help me pick out some clothes for myself, too.”\n\n\n I’ve never actually shopped for my own clothing since I’ve come here. As I think gleefully to myself about how I’m going shopping tomorrow, Lutz and I make our way home.\n\n\n “See you tomorrow, Lutz!” I say, beaming brilliantly.\n\n\n Lutz stares grimly at me. “We’re not done yet. I still have to deliver my report.”\n\n\n “…Huh?”\n\n\n I grimace, but, of course, there’s no way I can actually stop him from reporting anything.\n\n\n “Why didn’t you take care of yourself!” yells Tuuli, tears in her eyes.\n\n\n “Tuuli, don’t cry!”\n\n\n “I’m not crying! I’m mad!!”\n\n\n I know that Tuuli has still been very worried all this time about whether going to the temple would really cure the devouring or if I was still going to suddenly drop dead, so I feel incredibly guilty seeing her cry as she yells at me.\n\n\n “I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. I won’t do it again.”\n\n\n “…You’ll make sure you eat lunch?”\n\n\n “Of course!” I say, nodding vigorously.\n\n\n “You’re going to ask someone important all about mana?”\n\n\n “Yeah!”\n\n\n “You promise you won’t forget, even when you’re reading?”\n\n\n “…Ngh…”\n\n\n “Ma?ne?” she says, staring fixedly at me.\n\n\n No matter how hard she stares, though, I can’t make her a promise I know I won’t be able to keep. I’m self-aware enough to know that all reason leaves me the instant I’m in front of a book.\n\n\n “…I, I’ll tell my attendant to make sure I don’t forget. He’s a really serious person, so it’ll be fine!”\n\n\n She sighs, shrugging and shaking her head. “So you can’t promise it yourself, then?”\n\n\n No matter how disappointed she seems, though, I know I can’t keep that promise.\n\n\n My family’s still in shock, but they’re no longer quite so angry about it, so I decide to change the subject.\n\n\n “Hey, Tuuli. If you’ve got the day off, do you want to come along with me when I go out?”\n\n\n “Huh? Where are you going?”\n\n\n “I’m going to go buy some clothing for my attendants. We’re going to be looking at the kind of clothing that people in the north side wear, so even though we’re going to a second-hand store, it’ll be a good studying opportunity, you know?”\n\n\n On top of that, Benno’s going to be the one picking things out. He’s the proprietor of a shop that sells clothing to the nobility, so this would be an extremely valuable experience for her.\n\n\n “…It’s okay for me to come?”\n\n\n “Well, we’re going to be going to a bunch of places tomorrow, so if you’re okay with having to follow us around for all of it, then it should be.”\n\n\n “Okay! It’ll be fun.”\n\n\n She beams delightedly. I let out a sigh of relief, seeing her smiling her usual smile. Thank goodness. She’s not mad anymore.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “What, so you’re skipping out on going to the forest too, huh Tuuli?”\n\n\n As Tuuli, Lutz and I head out of the plaza with the water well towards the main road, hand in hand, someone calls out from behind us, a bit of a challenge in his voice.\n\n\n “Ah, Ralph,” says Tuuli.\n\n\n “Ralph!” I say.\n\n\n When we look over our shoulders, we see Lutz’s older brother Ralph standing behind us, dressed casually, with a basket strapped to his back. He looks like he’s going to the forest. When he sees that Tuuli’s put on her nicest clothes to go to the north side of town, and that Lutz and I are in our apprentice’s clothes, he frowns at us, just a little bit.\n\n\n “Where are you going?”\n\n\n “I’m going to go look at clothes and do some studying. Ralph, you’re going to the forest, right?”\n\n\n Tuuli still goes to the forest fairly often on her days off, using the chance to exchange information with her other friends who’ve also started working. Unlike before, though, our family’s finances are in much better shape, so it’s not absolutely critical for her to do so. Compared to a few years ago, I’m stuck in bed far less frequently. That, as well as the fact that Tuuli and I are both working, means that our finances have started looking significantly better.\n\n\n Lutz’s family, however, is saddled with the expenses of feeding four growing boys with hearty appetites. Even though all four of them are working, their family’s financial situation hasn’t gotten much better at all. An apprentice’s wages are low, so since their gathering trips to the forest haven’t been going so well, their eating situation has been particularly painful.\n\n\n As such, it’s obvious that all four boys need to be going to the forest on their days off to gather food. Lutz, however, despite supposedly only being an apprentice, still goes to Benno’s shop even on his days off. His family doesn’t think too well of this. He’s grumbled to me before about how his family has told him they’d rather he go bring things back from the forest than him bring back double his apprentice’s salary, with how much he’s working.\n\n\n Tuuli and Ralph walk side by side as we head towards the main road. Lutz, looking displeased, follows a little ways behind. As Lutz and I walk along, holding hands, Ralph occasionally glances back at us. When he does, I notice Lutz sighing a little.\n\n\n “Alright, see you later, Ralph,” says Tuuli. “Good luck!”\n\n\n “Yeah,” he replies.\n\n\n When we reach the main road, Ralph starts to head south, and the rest of us turn to head north. Tuuli waves enthusiastically at Ralph, then holds my free hand. We start walking towards the north side of town. Tuuli chatters enthusiastically about studying clothing. Lutz, perhaps having been told by Mark to become a good listener, listens carefully to what she’s saying.\n\n\n I feel someone’s eyes on me and look over my shoulder to see Ralph still standing where we’d parted ways, watching us, looking like there’s something he wants to say. When our gazes meet, he makes a face like he’s seen something irritating, then quickly turns around and runs off to the south. As I watch the distance quickly grow between us, I think of how quickly the distance between Lutz and his brothers is growing too, and cast my eyes downwards.\n\n\n When we arrive at the Gilberta Company, I see Benno, looking like he’s already gotten ready to leave, giving instructions to Mark and several other employees.\n\n\n “Ah,” he says, putting on a very believable smile, “are you coming with us today too, Tuuli? I heard from Corinna that you’ve got the potential to be a very excellent seamstress someday.”\n\n\n “Really?! I’m so happy!”\n\n\n Today, Benno will be the one bringing us along, rather than Mark. It seems like he needs to go to the Italian restaurant to take stock of how the remodeling is coming, to see if it’s being done as he’s ordered, to make sure the construction materials haven’t been swapped out for something cheaper, and so on.\n\n\n “Construction’s already started, then?” I ask.\n\n\n “It’s because I was able to find a place much faster than I expected. Right now it’s at the state where they’re expanding the kitchen so they can start putting in some ovens.”\n\n\n Benno has purchased from the foodservice association a building in the north side of town that had already been used as an eatery. It’s currently in the middle of being remodeled, first to get the kitchen ready, then to swap out all of the floorboards for high-quality ones, to match the image of a shop that sells food that nobles would eat.\n\n\n The concept of the restaurant is that it should be so high-class that patrons can feel as if they are really nobles as they dine. It also seems that one of the intended uses is going to be to hold tasting events, the patrons of which would be the proprietors of the large shops that do business with the nobility.\n\n\n “Ahh, so following along with what the guild master’s doing—”\n\n\n “No! Tasting events were your idea, so I’m not following the guild master’s lead at all.”\n\n\n “…I see.”\n\n\n Judging from appearances, the lumber, the brick, and iron seem alright, and there aren’t any real problems with the workmanship. The ovens aren’t finished just yet, but once they are, it looks like the cooks will be able to come in and practice until the restaurant’s official opening.\n\n\n “It’s great that it’s coming along so well,” I say.\n\n\n Benno holds me in his arms as he walks around the under-construction restaurant, which gives me the chance to look around myself. When I comment on the progress, though, Benno grimaces, then grumbles to himself, in a voice so low that only I can hear it.\n\n\n “No, there’s a huge pile of problems.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n “…Never mind, it’s not something you need to know.” He raises his voice, calling out to Lutz and Tuuli. “Hey, we’re going to the next shop.”\n\n\n We start heading towards a second-hand clothing store that apparently has deep ties to the Gilberta company.\n\n\n “I wonder what that restaurant’s going to serve, if it’s food like what the nobles eat? I really want to try it sometime…”\n\n\n Tuuli keeps looking back at the unfinished restaurant as we walk, causing her braid to bounce around. I look down from Benno’s shoulder at her and Lutz as they follow a couple steps behind him, and think back on the recipes that I’ve come up with.\n\n\n “Hmm, I’d say that about thirty percent of it is recipes you’ve eaten at home, fifty percent are new recipes for both food and sweets that require an oven to make, and the last twenty percent are things I created by putting some of Ilse’s recipes to practical use… or something like that?”\n\n\n Tuuli scrunches up her face, looking doubtful. “…So you’re saying that what that restaurant is going to be serving is your weird cooking?”\n\n\n “Tuuli, that’s so mean! You always say you like it, too!”\n\n\n It’s a real shock to hear her say that the food she always eats with a big smile is weird. Tuuli frantically amends her opinion.\n\n\n “It’s good! It’s really good. It’s just that your recipes are kind of surprising for people trying to make them for the first time, you know? I’m used to it already, though.”\n\n\n “Whatever’s fine,” adds Lutz, shrugging his shoulders, “as long as it’s tasty.”\n\n\n Lutz said “whatever’s fine” and Tuuli never retracted her “weird cooking” comment. To be fair, there are a few things a little bit different about how food is cooked here, so I can’t disagree with them entirely.\n\n\n “…What’s that?” asks Benno. “You’ve eaten Ma?ne’s cooking before?”\n\n\n Since the restaurant’s under construction and the cooks can’t yet use the kitchen, Benno hasn’t been able to try any of my cooking yet, making him the only person here who hasn’t.\n\n\n When he says that, though, Lutz and Tuuli exchange a very complicated glance.\n\n\n “Hmm… well, the recipes are Ma?ne’s, but… Right, Lutz?”\n\n\n “Yeah, it’s always us that make it. So I guess it doesn’t really feel like we’ve been eating Ma?ne’s cooking, right?”\n\n\n Of course.\n\n\n Since the two of them are rapidly growing and I really am not, our physiques are very different. To pull an example from my Urano days, it’s about the difference between a kindergartner and kids already halfway through elementary school. With just that much difference, it means that their reach is much greater than mine, as is their physical strength. That means that their scope of the things they can do is much greater than mine. I haven’t really become able to do all that much more, but the two of them are quickly becoming able to do more and more without parental assistance.\n\n\n “I really want to get bigger…” I grumble to myself.\n\n\n The only ears my words reach are Benno’s. I actually didn’t even notice that I’d said my thoughts out loud, so I’m a little bit startled when he pats me on the back comfortingly.\n\n\n The reason that I’m not growing much is because it’s a symptom of the devouring, so nobody can do anything to change it, but if Tuuli or Lutz were to hear my grumblings, I know that they’d get worried about me for sure. I sneakily look over Benno’s shoulder at them, checking to make sure they didn’t hear. When I see that they’re busily chatting about how tasty my recipes are, I breathe a sigh of relief.\n\n\n Since both the under-construction restaurant and the second-hand clothing store are in the north side of town, it doesn’t take us very long to get between them. When we arrive, I can see that, just as expected, this second-hand clothing store is entirely unlike the one that my family goes to. The store that I know has dirty gray and tan clothes piled in baskets, sorted roughly by size.\n\n\n Since the goods here are so much nicer, this store has all of its vividly-colored clothes, except for the underwear, neatly hung on cross-shaped wooden hangers. Since all of these clothes were once made to order, the sizes and colors are all different, but the atmosphere of the shop reminds me of my Urano days, when I saw a clothier in a small town, filled with whatever the proprietor liked to sell.\n\n\n When the four of us enter, a lady who looks like the shopkeeper looks up at us, wide-eyed, and immediately rushes over. Her tightly bundled hair is dark brown, and her similarly brown eyes glitter brilliantly when she looks us over.\n\n\n “Oh my, Benno. What’s all this? Since when did you have this many children—”\n\n\n “Now, what do you mean by that?”\n\n\n “I mean, the loveless Benno just brought a bunch of kids to my shop, didn’t he? That’s the kind of juicy little tidbit that can take on a life of its own. I’m sure our friends would love to hear all about it.”\n\n\n “Aw, give me a break for once.”\n\n\n These two look like they’ve known each other for ages. Lutz, Tuuli, and I stare dumbfoundedly at their casual, friendly banter. Ultimately, though, Benno cuts her off, turning things to business.\n\n\n “I came here to buy some clothes for these kids. While we’re here, I thought my apprentice might be able to learn a thing or two, too.”\n\n\n “You mean Lutz, right?” I ask. “What can he learn here?”\n\n\n “Alright, listen. If an apprentice at my shop can’t even pick out a single outfit, what do you think’s going to happen?”\n\n\n Lutz startles, seeming to be at a loss for words. He and Tuuli come from a commoner’s background, where the most important thing about a garment is how thick the cloth is, so they don’t have any eye for clothing themselves. It looks like Benno wants him to realize that and do some studying to fix it.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, something like this should be good for your attendants. This is a relatively recent style, and its sleeves are fairly short so it should be easy to move around in.”\n\n\n “If we’re looking for something like that, then I think that dark green and brown one over there would work well, wouldn’t it? He’s got a really earnest seriousness to him, so I’m thinking that he should wear something that doesn’t clash with his hair and eye color.”\n\n\n “…Yeah, that’ll do, won’t it? As for the other two, I’ve never seen them, so I don’t know what would work for them. If you keep in mind the general feel of what you picked out for Fran, you shouldn’t be too far off the mark. Go pick out something you think will work.”\n\n\n “Alri~ight!”\n\n\n Benno sets me down, and I start digging through the racks of children’s clothes, searching for things that might fit Gil and Delia. Although, even though we’re calling it “picking something out”, there aren’t actually that many things in each size, so selection is very limited. This, of course, means that it’s pretty quick to come to a decision. All that I need to do is hold these up against Lutz to make sure that the size will be more-or-less okay.\n\n\n Argh, if only there was a bigger variety to pick from…\n\n\n My excitement has largely dissipated since finding out that picking things out is pretty meaningless. What kind of luxurious times was I living in back in my Urano days? There was an overabundance of clothing everywhere. I didn’t really have a lot of interest in clothes back then, but it’s like they say, you don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone.\n\n\n “Lutz, Lutz, can I borrow you for a second?”\n\n\n “What’s up?”\n\n\n “Gil’s basically about your size, so I want to hold these up to you to see if they look like they’ll fit.”\n\n\n I quickly go through three boy’s outfits that I’ve found, holding them up to Lutz. The size looks about right. Out of the three, though, I found one that matches Lutz pretty well.\n\n\n “Out of the things I found in this size, I think this would look best on you. What should I pick for Gil, though…?”\n\n\n As I compare the outfits I’m holding, trying to figure out what would be better for Gil, Benno sighs.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, where did you learn how to pick out clothes?”\n\n\n “Where? …It’s not really something I ever studied, you know?”\n\n\n I’ve read books on color coordination and a variety of magazines on fashion, but I never formally studied it. If you really forced me to answer, I guess I’d say art class in school.\n\n\n “I really shouldn’t think too hard about you, should I?”\n\n\n “That’s right. Please just accept it and leave it alone. Lutz, let’s try these next.”\n\n\n I hold out a dress that I picked out for Delia. Lutz quickly shakes his head in refusal. Staring at the cute, predominately red dress, he makes an enormous X with his hands.\n\n\n “Isn’t that something better to do with Tuuli?! I don’t wanna.”\n\n\n “I mean, Tuuli’s bigger than you, isn’t she? Delia’s a little smaller than you are, so using Tuuli wouldn’t work at all.”\n\n\n Lutz clearly hates it, but I manage to get him to let me hold the things I’m picking for Delia up against his back. After all, neither Tuuli nor I are the right size.\n\n\n “Alright, Lutz,” says Benno. “Start looking for something in a color that would suit Ma?ne. Take that green and that green, for example. They’re both green, but they’re different shades of green. Which would look better on her?”\n\n\n Just like Lutz had been subjected to before, now I’m the one having clothes held up to her. Lutz and Tuuli both look back and forth between the clothes and me, serious expressions on their face. After a moment, they both point at the same piece of clothing.\n\n\n “That one!”\n\n\n “That’s right. This one matches her skin tone better. What about these two?”\n\n\n Benno starts explaining all sorts of aspects of color theory, holding various outfits against me as examples. He covers monochromatic colors, analogous colors, complementary colors, hue, saturation, lightness, and more. As I sit in my chair, listening in awe, wondering if piling up all of his accumulated knowledge would equal the book on color coordination I read, more and more clothing is held up to me.\n\n\n “Now, after you pound all this information about which colors suit which clients into your head, the next thing you’ll need to do is learn what styles to select. Clothes are the greatest indicator of one’s social standing and position. If you wear clothing that doesn’t match your station, then that will cause all sorts of trouble. You’ll remember Ma?ne’s baptismal ceremony, of course.”\n\n\n “Ahh…” I moan.\n\n\n “This time, the clothing we’re picking out is clothing that Ma?ne will be wearing to go to and from the temple. This is the clothing of someone who has attendants, so the important thing here is the length of the sleeve.”\n\n\n Now that I think about it, when we went to the temple, Benno was wearing a shirt with especially voluminous sleeves. They were so long that they looked like they would get in the way if he tried to do anything at all.\n\n\n “What long sleeves show is that she doesn’t have to do anything, because her attendants do everything for her, so she doesn’t have to worry about her sleeves getting dirty. Basically, people who have to work can’t let their sleeves droop like that.”\n\n\n “Huh? Wait, didn’t Mark have long sleeves too, though? They were about half the length of yours, though.”\n\n\n “Those were the sleeves of an attendant who you’d take with you to meet with a noble. The other party already had attendants or subordinates to do the work, so Mark didn’t have to do much of anything. On the other hand, if a noble were to visit us, Mark would wear short sleeves, to show that we’re giving them a warm reception. …We haven’t had any nobility come visit us, though.”\n\n\n I hum appreciatively, nodding lightly to show comprehension. Lutz and Tuuli, on the other hand, are paying rapt attention, their eyes glimmering.\n\n\n “Well then, you two, now that you’ve learned all that, pick out something for Ma?ne. I wonder, which of you will do a better job of it?”\n\n\n Lutz and Tuuli shoot each other a brief, sharp glare, then start circling the shop, looking for clothes. Benno looks on, smirking.\n\n\n “Good work bringing your sister along, Ma?ne. Having a rival makes people learn surprisingly quickly.”\n\n\n “I’m happy that this is such a good study opportunity for her,” I reply.\n\n\n While we watch the two of them taking to their education with zeal and trying their hardest to pick the best outfit, I try asking Benno about anything I need to be paying attention to when I’m interacting with noble society, but he just shakes his head.\n\n\n “Your situation is different from mine. I could tell you about what you should do as a merchant that’s doing business with the nobility, but if you want to know how to behave yourself when you’re working in the same circles as nobles, then you should ask Fran. Do what Lutz is doing and ask about even the tiniest things. He’s not going to know what you don’t know otherwise.”\n\n\n As I nod in comprehension, Lutz and Tuuli run up, clothing in hand.\n\n\n “Which would you pick, Ma?ne?”\n\n\n “…Huh? Umm…”\n\n\n The two of them press in close. I lean back, a little overwhelmed, and look at the outfits that the two of them brought over. Tuuli has picked a cute pink dress. Lutz picked a dress as well, this one using blue as its main color.\n\n\n “If I were to be just walking around outside, then I think what Tuuli picked is cuter, but if I think about how I’m going to be going to the temple, I think the dress Lutz picked would fit that job better. Choosing is hard…”\n\n\n “Try them on,” says Benno.\n\n\n At Benno’s direction, I take the dresses Tuuli and Lutz picked for me and follow the shopkeeper into a changing room. The shopkeeper helps me into the dress that Tuuli picked for me, then walks me over to a highly polished metal mirror.\n\n\n “…Whoa.”\n\n\n This is the first time I’ve seen my own face. My skin is pale, but not the kind of pale that would draw out the contours of my egg-shaped face. It comes across as more of an abnormal pallor, but part of that is due to the influence of my straight, deep blue hair.\n\n\n In the mirror, I see my large, full, ochre-yellow eyes, so bright they’re almost golden, opened wide with astonishment. My high-bridged, shapely nose and the plumpness of my lower lips matches my mother’s, but apart from the skin around my eyes, I don’t look that much like Tuuli.\n\n\n If I were to be childishly honest about it, according to my sensibilities from my Urano days, I am a cute little girl. However, I don’t know what this world’s standards are. Lutz calls me cute, so maybe my sense of aesthetics isn’t that off?\n\n\n As I brood, I’m brought out to show off the dress I’m wearing.\n\n\n “Whoa, Ma?ne, you’re so cute! That looks super good on you.”\n\n\n Tuuli gives me high praise as I wear the dress that she picked out for me, but Lutz just hums thoughtfully, his head cocked to the side. However, he looks a little bit annoyed about this, so he’s probably thinking that this matches me well enough that he can’t really find any fault with it.\n\n\n Benno, smiling wryly, waves his hand, silently directing me to try the next one on.\n\n\n “Yep, this one is definitely a better look!”\n\n\n I change into the dress that Lutz picked out and head back out to show them, and this time it’s Lutz who is beaming brilliantly as he praises me. Tuuli looks a little vexed, and peevishly says that her pick suits me better, which sparks an argument about which dress really is the better one. I tug on Benno’s sleeve, trying to get him to intervene in the rapidly intensifying quarrel, but he just looks around the shop, thoughtfully stroking his chin.\n\n\n “You got to see what you look like in the mirror, right? So, what do you think would suit you the best?”\n\n\n “Hmm… if I keep usefulness in mind, then maybe this, this, and this, I think?”\n\n\n The first thing I pick is a white blouse. The sleeves are long, and both the cuffs and collar are decorated with lace, so even though the design is simple, it looks like I could wear it in front of nobility. After that, I pick a blue skirt that looks like it would be perfect to wear when going to the temple. It’s embroidered with a floral design, but when I’m wearing my apprentice priestess’s robes, it’ll be covered up entirely. Finally, I pick a red, bodice-like vest that’s embroidered with flowers and adorned with lace.\n\n\n “If I do this, then if I make any additional purchases, or if I buy any replacements, then I can really change the look of the outfit, and I think that these pieces would work well with pieces of the apprentice’s clothes that I already have… what do you think?”\n\n\n When I look up at Benno, he smiles slightly at me, then turns to look at Lutz and Tuuli. The two of them look over the outfit I’ve picked with hollow faces.\n\n\n “Lutz, Tuuli,” says Benno. “There are more clothes here than just one-piece dresses. Abandon the notion that dresses is what girls wear.”\n\n\n The girls of poor families generally don’t wear anything but one-piece dresses. After all, they’re very easy to make, with a single seam from top to bottom, and they don’t use a whole lot of cloth. Even though we wear many layers to ward off the cold, we don’t put any effort into making it actually look good. Nobody has any blouses whose collars could be replaced or whose sleeves can be changed out for a different kind of lace.\n\n\n “Study hard until next time,” says Benno.\n\n\n “Yes, sir!”\n\n\n Tuuli and Lutz, who had been looking so dejected moments ago, raise their heads, the fire of rivalry burning in their eyes, and then, for some reason, look at me."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Man, we’ve got a lot to carry today.”\n\n\n Lutz, who came to pick me up this morning, looks down into a basket piled high with cloth. The basket, which is the one he uses when he goes to the forest, is packed with cloth-wrapped bundles of clothing. There’s the clothing for Fran, Delia, and Gil, my blue robe and sash, and the three-piece outfit that I’d bought just yesterday.\n\n\n My new outfit is cute, and it has a sort of traditional local charm to it, but it isn’t covered in patches, it’s covered in beautiful embroidery, and the sleeves are long and flowing. It is not the kind of thing that kids in this part of town wear. If I put this on and wandered around outside, I can’t even begin to imagine what people would start saying.\n\n\n Since we’re even being cautious about showing these to our families, Lutz and I are wearing the same street clothes we always do. We’ve headed to Benno’s shop, where we’ll get changed in Lutz’s storeroom there.\n\n\n As we do things in the north side of town, our garments and other personal effects are, bit by bit, becoming high-class. That’s just what to be expected, since high-class goods are what are used in that part of town. However, if we’re not careful, and people start thinking that we’re usually carrying around highly priced things, our trips to and from our homes will start to get more dangerous.\n\n\n A child’s first set of apprentice’s clothes are often new, specially prepared by parents in celebration of their child’s baptismal ceremony, so they don’t draw much attention, but if a child starts growing up and still keeps wearing new clothing, then, probably, they’ll catch the eye of a robber. So, I think it might be a good idea for me to ask Benno if he could get me some sort of place for me to store my things.\n\n\n “So,” I ask him, ”based on all that, would you be able to rent me a room for cheap?”\n\n\n While Lutz is upstairs in his own room, changing, and I’m here in the back office waiting for him, I decide to try asking if I could rent a room from him. Benno, grappling with a pile of paperwork, shoots me a look, an extremely skeptical expression on his face.\n\n\n “Sure, I could rent you a room, but if you want something cheap it’ll be in the attic, right? …Can you really go all the way up to the attic, every day, just to change your clothes?”\n\n\n I groan quietly to myself, remembering how I still get out of breath climbing up five stories to get home.\n\n\n “If I take it really, really, slowly, it’ll be alright, I think.”\n\n\n “Not in the slightest. Don’t you have a room in the temple? What do you do when you have visitors over?”\n\n\n “Visitors?”\n\n\n I’d made arrangements for going to the temple to donate my mana and read books. I don’t have anything arranged for receiving any sort of visitors. I tilt my head uncomprehendingly, and Benno looks up at me, setting his pen down.\n\n\n “Even when Lutz comes to pick you up, under ordinary circumstances, he should be sent to your room, right? How have you been doing it?”\n\n\n “…Lutz was asked to wait outside the gates, and a gray-robed priest came to get me. Ummm, in other words, I thought it might be okay if we worked things out so that the library could be my room?”\n\n\n “And that happened?!”\n\n\n “I mean, I just really wish it would happen…”\n\n\n I know that there’s no way the library, full of expensive books, could ever be my room. It’s just a wish.\n\n\n Benno sighs. “Well, whatever. …If you don’t have a room, then today you’re going to go talk to the head priest and ask to borrow one.”\n\n\n “Huh? Today?”\n\n\n “Lutz is already going to the temple today to talk with Fran about how to manage your condition.” “Alright. I’ll ask him about it.”\n\n\n The conversation dies down a bit, and Benno picks up and rings the bell on his desk. After a moment, one of his female employees steps through the inner door.\n\n\n “You called for me, sir?”\n\n\n “Help her get changed,” he orders. “Ma?ne, use that screen over there and get changed. Getting up to the attic is too much for you.”\n\n\n Eh? You want me to get changed here?!\n\n\n I choke down the words that threaten to fly from my throat. Benno, having given his instructions, picks up his pen and gets back to work. Briskly, the woman spreads out the screen, setting up a changing area for me. With how matter-of-factly everything is going, it feels like I’m the weird one for finding this bewildering, and I can’t really come up with any good way to object.\n\n\n “…Ummm, Mister Benno. I’m thankful for the offer, but I’m sure I can make it upstairs if I take it slowly, you know?”\n\n\n “Don’t waste what little energy you have right before you head out.”\n\n\n Benno smashes through my feeble resistance with a single sentence. Maybe he’s doing this out of concern, or maybe consideration, or maybe because I’m a little girl, so if I just tell myself I don’t need to be embarrassed I won’t be embarrassed, right…? No, no, I’m still pretty embarrassed!\n\n\n “Ummm…”\n\n\n “What will you be changing into?” asks the woman. “These? …Alright, everything’s ready. Please come back here, if you will.”\n\n\n “Make sure you’re all ready by the time Lutz gets back down,” says Benno.\n\n\n With no time for me to object, everything’s been set up for me to get changed. I give in, heading behind the screen.\n\n\n “…Then, thank you very much for your assistance.”\n\n\n I just want to get this embarrassing thing over with as quickly as possible. If I let this woman help me, then I can get changed in no time. If I get my dress off and the blouse on immediately, the blouse will hang down past my butt so even if someone were to see me I won’t be indecent.\n\n\n The woman helps me button up about half of the many tiny buttons on the blouse, helps me adjust the length and waist of the skirt, and helps me tie up the laces on the bodice. Finally, we put the hairpin Benno gave me in my hair, and everything is complete.\n\n\n “I’m all done, Mister Benno. Thank you.”\n\n\n Holding my folded-up street clothes, I step out from behind the screen. Benno looks up from his desk, slowly looking me up and down.\n\n\n “…Well, that works well enough.”\n\n\n “Eh? Eh? By ‘that works’, do you mean I look like a proper young lady? Do I look really cute?”\n\n\n “As long as you’re not talking.”\n\n\n “Ngh?”\n\n\n I shut my mouth, putting my street clothes into the basket. Mark enters the room, bringing Lutz with him.\n\n\n “Pardon my intrusion,” he says. “Ah, Ma?ne. You’ve finished changing, I see?”\n\n\n “Thanks to Mister Benno’s help,” I reply.\n\n\n He pauses, looking over at Benno. “…Master Benno?”\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you idiot!” says Benno. ”Don’t skip the important part! All I did was call Matilda in.”\n\n\n Benno, roughly scratching his head, looks pointedly over at Matilda as she puts away the screen. “Ahh,” says Mark, nodding, before pushing Lutz, having changed into his apprentice’s clothes, in front of him. Benno glances briefly at Lutz, making sure that he’s carrying a particular wooden tablet, then nods.\n\n\n “Alright, Lutz, today your job is to go to the temple and have a talk with Fran, one of Ma?ne’s attendants, about how to manage her physical condition. Have you finished the summary of what you’re going to explain to him?”\n\n\n “Yes, Master Benno.”\n\n\n Lutz bows politely, just like how Mark does, then picks up his basket and leaves the room. Seeing him acting like a model shop assistant makes me feel a little proud. I can understand, at least a little bit, what a parent must feel when they come to watch their kid at school on parents’ day.\n\n\n Aaah, Lutz is growing up, too…\n\n\n “Wow, Lutz, your posture and tone are really good,” I say, as I follow him out of the shop.\n\n\n “I’m not there yet, but this is part of my job, too.”\n\n\n Lutz huffs proudly, smiling. I think it’s wonderful that he’s able to be proud of his own hard work. I’ve definitely got to follow his example.\n\n\n “You’re doing so well being polite at the store. I’ve got to do the same and try to talk like a young lady at the temple, too.”\n\n\n “…Can you do that?”\n\n\n “When I tried, Mister Benno didn’t tell me I failed, so I don’t think it’s that weird. But it’s something that I need to practice so that I can get used to it. …When we get there, I’m going to start talking differently, so even if it doesn’t really fit me, you’d better not start laughing.”\n\n\n If Lutz starts laughing, then my rich girl act, which I’m still very much not used to, will instantly come crumbling down.\n\n\n “…Do I need to talk politely, too?”\n\n\n “Mister Benno really surprised me with how careful he was being with his words when he was talking with nobles. I think you should aim to be pretty polite, maybe?”\n\n\n “Y… yeah…”\n\n\n When I arrive at the temple, all three of my attendants are waiting for me in the courtyard beyond the gates. As I wonder to myself how they’d managed to do this when nobody’d contacted them in advance, Lutz kindly informs me that the Gilberta Company had sent a messenger ahead of us. It seems that even when returning home, word must be sent in advance. Noble society is too much of a pain in the ass.\n\n\n Now then, how do I greet them? “Hello,” maybe? “I’m back,” perhaps? Hmmm…\n\n\n “Heh heh, I got you in trouble, didn’t I?”\n\n\n “…Huh?”\n\n\n I’d planned to use my rich girl voice for all of my interactions at the temple today, but Delia ruined that plan from the outset. I make a confused noise, tilting my head. Fran steps forward, pushing Delia aside.\n\n\n “Welcome back, Sister Ma?ne. I am glad for your safe return. I have truly been awaiting your arrival.”\n\n\n I quickly pull myself together. “I thank you, Fran,” I reply, taking care to speak as eloquently as I can. “Has anything of note happened while I’ve been away, perhaps?”\n\n\n Fran crosses his hands before his chest, bowing slightly. “All is well,” he says.\n\n\n “What is well?” interjects Delia. “She had a visitor come by, but she didn’t have her attendants with her! Now that was a public embarrassment, wasn’t it? Heh heh, this makes me so happy.”\n\n\n Based on how she’s puffing out her chest, this seems like it should be an exceptionally embarrassing event, but I don’t recall feeling particularly embarrassed at all. Instead, I learned how skilled Fran is, and actually felt rather relieved that neither of the other two were there to cause problems for me.\n\n\n “…Fran was there, of course,” I say.\n\n\n “Hmph! That just meant that now everyone knows you can only bring out one attendant. You couldn’t even offer them flowers! I’m sure your visitor must have been very disappointed.”\n\n\n What does “offering flowers” involve? Even just from context, I don’t really feel the need to know, though. Benno made acquaintances with the head priest, pleased the head priest with his gifts, and seized the initiative in the conversation about distributing the profits of Ma?ne’s Workshop, so that was entirely satisfactory, wasn’t it?\n\n\n I don’t really understand, but it looks like Delia wants to hear that she did in fact cause me trouble. This is a huge bother, so there’s no better way to get this over with than as quickly as possible.\n\n\n “Argh. Yes. That was a problem. I’m in a lot of trouble now.”\n\n\n “Heh heh. Wasn’t it?”\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne,” says Fran, “what―”\n\n\n “You’re causing me trouble, Delia. Even now.”\n\n\n Fran looks down passively, seeming to understand what I’m going after. I glance briefly at the clothing in the basket on Lutz’s back, then look evenly at Delia, slowly tilting my head to the side.\n\n\n “How can I get you to work for me seriously, Delia?”\n\n\n “There’s no way I’d ever work for you, now is there?! You’re some kind of idiot, aren’t you! Too stupid.”\n\n\n Delia smiles triumphantly, turns around, and leaves to go off somewhere. She didn’t say any goodbyes, just doing whatever she wanted, so just like before, even though I wound up driving her away, I don’t feel the slightest bit guilty. It’s actually a bit refreshing.\n\n\n “…Hey, Ma?ne,” says Lutz. “Who was that?”\n\n\n “One of my attendants,” I reply.\n\n\n “What? Someone like that can be an attendant?”\n\n\n Lutz, dumbfounded, watches Delia as she heads off into the distance. His resolve to speak politely seems to have completely crumbled away. I understand completely. If I don’t put some willpower into it, my proper young lady speech isn’t going to come back either.\n\n\n “I apologize for my impertinence,” objects Fran immediately, perhaps feeling that his profession had been insulted, “but she is very much outside the norm.”\n\n\n Being an attendant is a job that requires one to be an excellent individual, like Fran is, so it’s likely that Delia, who had her eyes set on becoming the temple master’s mistress, is indeed outside the norm.\n\n\n “Fran, here, is an excellent attendant,” I tell Lutz. “Delia has certain problems, though…”\n\n\n “Hmm. So they’re not all like that, huh? That’s good.”\n\n\n As soon as Lutz voices his understanding, the other problem child butts into the conversation, pointing straight at Lutz.\n\n\n “And how about you, just kinda barging in here? What gives you the right?”\n\n\n “…Who’s this?” says Lutz, making an unpleasant face.\n\n\n Given that the two of them are the same height and build, and they’re having this conversation here, I’d assume that Lutz has already figured out that this boy is Gil.\n\n\n “An attendant,” I reply, matter-of-factly.\n\n\n “Please think of this one as unusual as well,” says Fran.\n\n\n “You mean you’re the only decent one?!” cries Lutz. “What’s up with that?!”\n\n\n I have no follow-up. To Lutz, who sees that two out of my three attendants are outside the norm, it obviously looks like Fran is in the minority. As Fran and I stand there, at our wits’ end, Gil turns to yell at Lutz.\n\n\n “What’s up with you, you outsider!”\n\n\n “I’m Lutz. Ma?ne’s associate. I’m the one primarily involved with managing her condition. I’m here because Master Benno asked me to talk with her attendants about how to manage her condition as well. And you, an attendant who can’t even manage a simple greeting…”\n\n\n To Lutz, who had been nervous about having to introduce himself to a nobleman, this must have seemed like a huge anticlimax.\n\n\n “I’m sorry, Lutz. It’s because I’m still inexperienced as a master.”\n\n\n “Isn’t supporting you with that something your attendants are supposed to be doing? Do you really need someone like this who can’t even do the work he’s assigned? If he doesn’t want to work, get rid of him. That other girl, too, she’s not thinking of anything but how to cause you trouble.”\n\n\n It is exactly as he says, but since these attendants were specifically assigned to me, I can’t get rid of them so easily.\n\n\n “Well,” I say, “their stupidity is actually kind of helpful, in some cases, so it’s all good for now.”\n\n\n “…Helpful?” he says, skeptically.\n\n\n “Delia is the temple master’s spy, for example, but whenever she does anything, she immediately tells me about it. I definitely prefer that over someone who actually sneaks around in the shadows.”\n\n\n I really do prefer these kids over people I’d have no control over at all. “What a pain,” he mutters, shrugging.\n\n\n “…Hey. Tiny. You making fun of us?” says Gil.\n\n\n Gil glares daggers at me and Lutz. I’m pretty sure that he’s pointing out my stature when he said “tiny,” but I don’t feel like giving him the dignity of a response.\n\n\n “Fran, I have a favor to request of you,” I say.\n\n\n “Certainly, Sister. What do you wish me to do?”\n\n\n “Don’t ignore me! Stop being stupid!”\n\n\n Gil lunges forward, yelling, and grabs my arm, pulling with all his might. Given the differences in our physiques and our strength, he has no trouble pulling me, with my body barely big enough to be a four- or five-year-old, off-balance.\n\n\n “Yaagh!” I yelp.\n\n\n As I’m yanked off my feet, Lutz is there to grab me, and we fall to the ground together. I sit there, squashing Lutz, blinking uncomprehendingly, not quite processing what had just happened in that single instant.\n\n\n I slowly look around me. Fran, who I had just been talking with, looked like he had reached out to grab me, but didn’t make it in time, so he’s just standing there, looking at me, with his arm outstretched. Gil stands there in shock, looking back and forth between me and his hand, as if he can’t believe that he’d been able to send me flying so easily.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you okay?” asks Lutz.\n\n\n “You caught me, so I’m all good. You okay?”\n\n\n “Yeah. So that’s one of your attendants, huh? Looks like he needs some discipline, doesn’t he?”\n\n\n Lutz’s tone of voice is no different than it usually is, but a fierce anger burns in his eyes as he looks at me. It almost looks like the color of his eyes is the tiniest bit lighter. Realizing just how angry he is, I flinch back.\n\n\n “He really does, but I don’t know if he deserves the kind of time, effort, and caring that would take… plus, I don’t really have the strength to do it myself.”\n\n\n “Alright, then, I’ll do it for you.”\n\n\n From the way he’s speaking, he’s itching for a fight. He helps me stand up, looks me over to make sure I’m unhurt, and hands me over to Fran. In the next instant, he leaps towards Gil, punching him square in the face.\n\n\n “You idiot! What were you going to do if she got hurt?!”\n\n\n In the poor parts of town, there are, of course, tons of quarrels between kids, but there’s a tacit understanding that you need to keep a close eye on your opponent if you get in a fight. After all, in the poor parts of town, your body is ultimately the source of your income, so it is strictly forbidden to go too far in a fight.\n\n\n This time, Gil clearly went too far. If he’d just kept talking, then Lutz would have shrugged it off and shot back a few of his own. However, Lutz had been told, both by my family and by Benno, to protect me, and Gil had dared to raise a hand against me in front of him. When I’m supposed to be his master, too, on top of that.\n\n\n “What are you doing?!” yells Gil.\n\n\n “That’s my line! What kind of attendant attacks his master, idiot?!”\n\n\n Since it’s only natural that Gil should be paid back for attacking me, I stay quiet as I watch Lutz beat up Gil, thinking to myself that it would be great if this got him to behave.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne,” says Fran, “um, should you not stop Master Lutz—”\n\n\n “Why would I do such a thing? Is it not my duty as Gil’s master to discipline him? All that is happening is that Lutz is kindly doing it in my stead. I’m very happy for his help. After all, I lack the strength to do it myself.”\n\n\n I also don’t care enough, though, I add, in my head. Fran nervously looks back and forth between me and Gil, who is being slapped senseless.\n\n\n “You wish to discipline him… right? You could send him to the reflection room, or withhold the gods’ blessings, or…”\n\n\n “The reflection room?”\n\n\n “You… you musn’t resort to violence!”\n\n\n It seems that even discipline is greatly different between the poor parts of town and the temple.\n\n\n “Lutz, that’s enough,” I say.\n\n\n “This guy still doesn’t get it. He just keeps saying ‘why are you hitting me’ over and over.”\n\n\n “Fran says disciplining people in the temple doesn’t involve hitting them.”\n\n\n “Huh? Discipline is discipline, right?”\n\n\n “It looks like it’s different here.”\n\n\n Lutz clucks his tongue disappointedly as he takes his hands off of Gil. Apart from that first punch, the rest of the hits had been with an open palm, so Gil doesn’t have any obvious injuries.\n\n\n “Seriously. Not only does this guy not do the things he has to, he tried to hurt you. He’s the worst. I can’t let a dangerous attendant like this stay with you. Get rid of him.”\n\n\n “She doesn’t do what she has to either!” yells Gil. “She’s doesn’t give me anything she’s supposed to!”\n\n\n He stands up, holding a hand to his face, glaring at me. It seems like, once again, there’s another bit of common knowledge that I don’t know.\n\n\n “Say, Fran. What, perhaps, am I supposed to be giving him?”\n\n\n “What,” says Gil, before Fran can respond, “you seriously don’t know?! How ignorant are you!”\n\n\n His squawking does nothing to advance the conversation. He should be fully aware that I don’t know any of the things that are considered common knowledge in the temple, but he’s still yelling about it. What an idiot.\n\n\n “Gil,” I say, “how stupid are you?”\n\n\n “What did you—?!”\n\n\n “I said it myself, didn’t I? I don’t know the common knowledge here. So why are you still thinking that I should know about this? Shouldn’t it be obvious, right from the start, that the daughter of commoners isn’t going to know anything about what goes on in the temple? Are you still seriously expecting me to know that?”\n\n\n “Ngh…”\n\n\n Gil grinds his teeth, glaring at me, unable to retort. Lutz steps between the two of us, as if he’s protecting me from Gil.\n\n\n “So why are you acting all self-important and yelling about the things she’s 'supposed’ to be giving you? What does she owe someone who doesn’t even bother doing his job? How did you come to the conclusion that someone who doesn’t do anything is owed anything?”\n\n\n “The blessings of the gods are given equally to everyone! Even though you get them sooner if you go up the ranks, everything is equal! It doesn’t matter what your job is!”\n\n\n “Huh?!” replies Lutz, a challenging tone in his voice.\n\n\n Lutz and I exchange glances, neither of us understanding what Gil is trying to get at. I glance over at Fran, who is still standing next to me.\n\n\n “Fran. Might I ask you to explain this to me, perhaps? What might I be expected to give to Gil?”"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Fran looks back and forth between me and Gil, then slowly opens his mouth to speak.\n\n\n “It is the duty of the blue-robed clergy to distribute the blessings of the gods—rather, the necessities of life―amongst their subordinates. When a blue-robed priest or priestess joins the temple, they are given attendants, to whom they grant rooms and clothing so that their attendants may live alongside them.”\n\n\n “As I do not have a room at the temple,” I say, “is it the case that my attendants must still live at the orphanage?”\n\n\n Fran nods slowly. “Essentially, yes. Furthermore, with regards to meals: a priest eats first, then their attendants and apprentices dine on the remainder, then what remains of that is brought to the orphanage as the blessings of the gods. You may note that it is natural, as such, for the blessings bestowed upon an attendant to be much more plentiful than those bestowed upon the orphans.”\n\n\n I didn’t want to be separated from my family, so my number one concern was making sure that I didn’t have to go to the orphanage. I’d been happy to be given the right to still live at home, but I hadn’t thought of how breaking with the temple’s customs like that would affect my attendants.\n\n\n “Then, Fran, as you have been reassigned from Father Ferdinand’s service to my own, were you thus forced to leave his chambers and return to the orphanage?”\n\n\n If that’s the case, then it would be natural for him to be depressed about his demotion and lash out because of it. Fran has been nothing but extremely helpful, but I really haven’t done anything to repay him yet. I’d been planning on splurging to give him weekend pay, but I might need to talk to the head priest as soon as possible about improving his working conditions.\n\n\n “No, I have not had to move from his chambers. Delia, I believe, has most likely not had to move either. When you are not at the temple, I assist Father Ferdinand in the performance of his duties and, as such, take my meals there.”\n\n\n Come to think of it, the head priest did say he was swamped with work and didn’t have enough capable people to help with it, didn’t he. I don’t think he’d leave someone like Fran to his own devices when I’m not around. I let out a small sigh of relief, happy to hear that I hadn’t subjected Fran to anything terrible.\n\n\n “So, in other words, are you perhaps saying that the only one impacted by this is Gil?”\n\n\n “I believe that he may be angry at not having had his expectations of improved treatment met. At the orphanage, regardless of whether one does their work or not, the blessings of the gods are distributed equally. However, it is not uncommon for attendants who do not perform their duties to be replaced. I personally find the thought that someone could expect to receive blessings as though they were an attendant while not actually performing their duties distasteful.”\n\n\n Fran, who takes a lot of pride in his work, glances briefly at Gil.\n\n\n “…So, in your view, there are no problems with things as they currently are?”\n\n\n “Yes, Sister Ma?ne.”\n\n\n “Then, perhaps I shall maintain the status quo for now, and be sure to be careful of how this may inconvenience you, Fran. Does this sound reasonable?”\n\n\n He pauses for a moment, possibly comparing how things are now to how they would be if I had a room of my own. “…Of course, Sister Ma?ne,” he says, quietly nodding.\n\n\n As soon as I start thinking that this conversation is finished, though, Gil starts yapping again.\n\n\n “Yeah, Fran, Fran, well, what about me?! I’m an attendant, too, just like him!”\n\n\n “…Don’t you think that’s a little off? You made it quite clear that you don’t consider me to be your master, did you not? Why, perhaps, would you think that I, who am not your master, should provide you with the necessities of life?”\n\n\n No matter how I look at it, nothing he’s done seems like the actions of an attendant looking to improve his working conditions.\n\n\n “That’s your duty as a blue-robed priest! Wh… what would be different if I did my work even though you’re not giving me food or a room?!”\n\n\n “I’d pay you,” I reply.\n\n\n I’ve been thinking that, just like how Benno pays Mark and Lutz a wage, I need to make sure to pay my attendants. Of course, based on the amount of work they do and the quality of the result, their pay would change. There’s no way I’d pay Fran and Gil the same wage.\n\n\n “…What’s ‘pay’?”\n\n\n Gil blinks a few times, tilting his head in confusion. Lutz snorts with laughter, throwing Gil’s words from earlier back at him.\n\n\n “What, you seriously don’t know? You work, then you get paid. Everyone knows that, right?”\n\n\n “N, no they don’t!”\n\n\n “Pay is your reward for doing your work. It’s money that attendants who work for me will be paid.”\n\n\n “Money? …Ah, ahh, money, huh.”\n\n\n It looks like Gil doesn’t know anything about money, either, from the way that he’s still tilting his head, but when his eyes briefly meet Lutz’s, he puts on a knowing expression.\n\n\n “I, for one,” I say, “would of course feel obligated to ask the head priest about acquiring a room for someone hardworking like Fran, but I see no real need to go to the trouble of such negotiations for someone like you, Gil, who does no work at all. No need in the slightest. That would cut into my reading time, now wouldn’t it?”\n\n\n My mornings are taken up by assisting the head priest and my lunchtime must absolutely be used for eating. All of that already chews up my limited time to read, so there’s no way I’d actually want to waste even more.\n\n\n “Now then, Fran. Would you please guide me towards the head priest’s chambers? I will be assisting him with his paperwork this morning.”\n\n\n “Of course, Sister Ma?ne.”\n\n\n Fran takes the lead, followed by me and Lutz, with Gil trailing behind.\n\n\n “Hey,” says Gil, “if I do my work, things’ll change, right?”\n\n\n “Of course,” I reply. “I fully plan to compensate you for whatever work is done.”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “I apologize for the intrusion, Father Ferdinand,” says Fran as he steps through the door to the head priest’s room. “Sister Ma?ne has arrived to see you.”\n\n\n The head priest looks up from his desk. “Ah, you made it? How are you feeling?”\n\n\n “Thank you for your concern, Father,” I reply, “but I am feeling quite well today. This is pure conjecture, but I believe that my earlier collapse may have been an aftereffect of the dedications. Do you know if one’s physical condition worsens when their body is not suffused with mana?”\n\n\n He puts down his pen, looking off into space as if searching through his memories. “I know that people have died after their mana reserves are completely exhausted, but I’ve never heard of someone becoming physically weak if they don’t maintain mana throughout their body. It might be a peculiarity of the devouring.”\n\n\n “A peculiarity of the devouring?”\n\n\n “It’s possible. It is already rare to find individuals with the devouring, and since they often die young due to having too much mana, it hasn’t been studied in great detail. There are hardly any people with as much mana as you do who have been able to stay alive. It’s something I would very much like to study more closely.”\n\n\n He fixes his eyes on me, looking like a mad scientist who has just found his perfect research subject, and shivers run down my spine. I fight back the urge to immediately run away from his overpowering curiosity, instead forcefully changing the subject.\n\n\n “I have another question. If I recall correctly, the blue-robed clergy are sometimes asked to go to the nobles’ quarter to perform rituals, are they not? Is there any particular sort of clothing that I should acquire, or…?”\n\n\n “There’s rituals that need to be performed yearly, but there aren’t many that would require an apprentice like you to come along. There isn’t any particular clothing you’d need, but it would be best if you were to have ceremonial blue robes made. …Speaking of which, where are your robes?”\n\n\n When he points it out, I suddenly remember that I haven’t actually put on my robes yet.\n\n\n “I have been told that it would be dangerous for me to wear my robes out of the temple, so I was intending to put them on when I arrived here.”\n\n\n “What’s dangerous about that?”\n\n\n “I may be mistaken for the child of nobles, kidnapped, and held for ransom. One moment, please, if I may…”\n\n\n I stick my hand into Lutz’s basket, which he’s set down at his feet, pulling out my bundled up robe and sash.\n\n\n “What are you…?” asks Lutz.\n\n\n “I’m putting on my robes,” I reply.\n\n\n I stick my head into the robes, carefully arranging the cloth so that it won’t tangle on my hairpin, then pull them down over me like I usually do. When my head pops out, I notice that Fran, at some point during this process, has knelt beside me. He has his hand stretched out, an awkward expression on his face.\n\n\n “Is there something wrong, Fran?”\n\n\n “…I was intending to assist you in getting dressed,” he replies.\n\n\n “Ah, um… could you assist me with my sash, please?”\n\n\n I probably shouldn’t mention that this is something I could easily do myself. I need to figure out what an attendant’s job actually is, somehow. As I hold still, my arms raised as Fran ties my sash around me, the head priest stares at me in exasperation.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, please get changed in your own room. This is unsightly.”\n\n\n Unexpectedly, the topic of having a room of my own has come up on its own. Since I know I’m going to have to get changed every day, I wonder if I could borrow some sort of locker room or storage room?\n\n\n “…Will you be giving me a room?”\n\n\n “No, I misspoke. When discussing your situation with the Reverend, I was able to secure you the right to live at home by asking if he would rather you instead be given a room in the part of the temple reserved for the nobility. Since he seemed happy to refuse that to you, I can’t give you a room.”\n\n\n I didn’t actually know that the head priest was the only priest who’d thought that letting me do something convenient like commute to work was a good idea. It seems like he’s been bending over backwards for my sake when I haven’t been around.\n\n\n “Um, Father Ferdinand, are there no rooms outside the noble areas that I could use?”\n\n\n This idea seems to take him completely by surprise. He scowls at me so intensely that I think he might have completely misunderstood me. As he stares at me in total incredulity, I frantically try to explain my thinking.\n\n\n “As you well know, although I wear blue robes, I am not a noble. As such, I have no expectation that I would be given a room that would otherwise be used by the nobility. If I could have a place to store my belongings and get dressed, as well as to have Lutz or Benno wait for me in if they come to visit, that would be more than plenty. Is there perhaps a storeroom that I could use for this purpose?”\n\n\n The head priest’s eyes fly open. “You want to receive guests in a storeroom?!” he yells. “How rude can you get?!”\n\n\n Sure, it would be rude to my visitors, but no more so than things are right now.\n\n\n “I understand what you are saying,” I continue, “but at this moment I don’t even have a storeroom. When Lutz has come to meet me, has he not been asked to wait for me outside the temple gates? I believe it is just as rude to ask a visitor to stand outside the gates as they wait for me, is it not?”\n\n\n “Even if it’s just for a short while, having a blue-robed priestess’s guests do that is unthinkable…” He rubs tiredly at his temples. “At the very least, I’m going to instruct the gatekeepers to bring them to a waiting room.”\n\n\n It seems that commoners who are visiting for some unknown reason are treated differently from people visiting a blue-robed priestess. I can tell that right now, he’s reminding himself of how I am not just a poor, ordinary girl, but an apprentice blue-robed priestess.\n\n\n “…Father Ferdinand,” says Arnaud, “might I suggest that Sister Ma?ne be allowed to use the orphanage director’s office? They are far from the parts of the temple used by the nobility, but they are rooms previously used by a blue-robed priestess, so it is my belief that there would be no problems in having guests visit those rooms.”\n\n\n When he says that, a quiet disturbance ripples through the other priests in the room. The head priest makes a difficult expression, thinking for a moment, then nods.\n\n\n “Very well, then. Ma?ne, you may use the orphanage director’s office. Please use those from now on when you change your clothes or receive visitors. When your work here is done, Fran will show you to them.”\n\n\n “I’m very sorry if I am speaking out of turn,” I say, “but could we perhaps do that first? Lutz has come with me today to speak with Fran about the matter of managing my physical condition. They will need someplace where they can have such a conversation.”\n\n\n I’d thought that this was a perfect opportunity, but the head priest shakes his head.\n\n\n “The director’s office has been locked up for quite some time, so it is in need of enough work that it can’t be used immediately. Since you’re going to be working here in this room, it should be fine to them to have their discussion here. Fran, use that table there, please.”\n\n\n “Thank you, Father Ferdinand,” says Fran.\n\n\n Fran and Lutz move over to the table that the head priest points out. As I watch them go, I notice that Gil, looking tremendously bored, follows along.\n\n\n “Father Ferdinand,” I say, “if those rooms are so in need of maintenance, then is that not still more reason why it would be best for me to gain access to them now? If I could do so, then perhaps this morning, while I work here, I could have Gil sweep them out.”\n\n\n “What? Me?”\n\n\n Gil points at himself, shocked at how he’d been suddenly assigned work, looking around to see if I’d actually meant anyone else. The other priests in the room glance at each other, shocked. “She’s trusting him to do that?” mutters one. “I heard he got sent to the reflection room for refusing to sweep out the hall of worship,” whispers another. It seems that Gil’s lack of work ethic is famous.\n\n\n “…Hm?” I say, lightly. “Do you not know how?”\n\n\n “Of course I do!”\n\n\n “Ah,” I respond. “I look forward to seeing what you can do, then. Do your best!”\n\n\n As I encourage Gil, the head priest hands a key to a young, gray-robed apprentice priest, who then leads Gil out of the room. The head priest watches them go, then, when the door clicks shut, turns to look at me.\n\n\n “Are you sure that was a good idea?” he says.\n\n\n “If I don’t give him any work, then I can’t give him a proper assessment,” I respond.\n\n\n By the time the apprentice priest returns with the key, Lutz and Fran are already deep in their discussion about managing my condition, and I have already started helping the head priest with his paperwork.\n\n\n Today, the work I’ve been assigned involves balancing the ledgers. “Since you’re a merchant, this should be simple,” the head priest said. The calculations themselves are simple enough, but no matter how much faith he’s putting in my ability to handle this all by myself, I’m actually a little stumped. In particular, there are a few things in here that don’t match up with anything I’m familiar with.\n\n\n “The calculations are the same as what I am used to,” I tell him, “but it seems that the temple’s accounting differs in several ways than what I usually encounter. What might this item here, 'the will of the gods’, be? At a glance, it seems to be the most common entry in the expenses.”\n\n\n Some of the other expenses are things like “offerings to the gods”, “flowers to the gods”, “water to the gods”, and even “the gods’ affection”. The thought of managing this account book, filled with cryptic god-related line items, is pretty scary.\n\n\n The head priest, in response to my question, looks at me with a perfectly blank expression for a short while. “Maybe it’s too much,” he mutters to himself, then points out a small section of the ledger.\n\n\n “…I’d like you to go over these numbers for me today,” he says.\n\n\n “Of course,” I reply. “…Lutz, might I borrow your slate? I seem to have forgotten mine.”\n\n\n “Huh? Oh, yeah, here.”\n\n\n Lutz rummages around in his basket, then pulls out the slate from his apprentice’s set. I borrow it from him, then start working through the numbers in the indicated section of the ledger. As I work, the head priest looks on as if something’s unusual, but since he doesn’t ask me any questions, I ignore him and focus on my work.\n\n\n “…You’re quick at that,” he remarks.\n\n\n “Ah, am I?” I reply, noncommittally.\n\n\n I’m just used to it after having done so much of it at the gates. Doing all of this math like this only makes me yearn for an actual electronic calculator.\n\n\n As I continue wholeheartedly grinding through these numbers, I hear the fourth bell chime, signaling that it’s time for lunch.\n\n\n “That’s enough for today,” says the head priest. When he says that, the various priests in the room start bustling around, tidying everything up.\n\n\n “Ma?ne,” he says, “this is the key for the orphanage director’s room. Please leave it with Fran so that you don’t lose it. Also, here’s your portion of the donation you brought.”\n\n\n He hands me one large and six small silver coins. He mentions that it might seem strange that I’d be getting a portion of the money that I donated, but since it’s divided amongst all of the blue-robed clergy, it’s mine to keep.\n\n\n “Since you have a room now, this is as good an opportunity as any. Bring those with you, too.”\n\n\n He glances over at one of the shelves in the corner, where the gifts that Benno had brought are neatly stacked. Since I’d collapsed before anything could be done with them, it seems like they’ve been just sitting there ever since. Finely-woven cloth, a pot full of rinsham, and a stack of vegetable-based paper are all neatly wrapped in bundles of cloth.\n\n\n Fran picks up the packages, Lutz shoulders his basket, I take the key in hand, and the three of us head towards the orphanage director’s office. As we walk, Fran starts explaining a few things about the room we’re approaching.\n\n\n “The two three-story buildings to each side of the hall of worship belong to the orphanage. The boys and girls are separated into the two buildings, with the hall of worship between them. The director’s office, which you will be using, is in the boys’ dormitory.”\n\n\n “Huh? Wasn’t the person previously using those rooms a priestess? Why would it be in the boys’ dormitory?”\n\n\n Fran looks troubled for a moment, his eyes wandering around the halls, then he lets out a small chuckle.\n\n\n “Perhaps it might be best if you didn’t know the full details,” he says.\n\n\n “…I see.”\n\n\n I’m curious about what he’s hiding, but given how tightly and obstinately he’s pressed his lips together, it doesn’t seem likely that I’ll be able to get it out of him.\n\n\n “The orphanage is real close to the gates,” says Lutz. “You’ll be able to get changed right after you get here, so this is actually pretty great for you, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “Yeah, looks like it,” I reply.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne,” says Fran, “the entrance to the director’s office is on the far side of the building from the gates, so that there is a straight path from it to the nobles’ section of the temple. It is separated from the other entrances so that the orphans do not mistakenly come barging in, so please take care not to mistake the entrances yourself.”\n\n\n I try to hide my mounting agitation. Based on how Arnaud referred to the room, the fact that the head priest was reluctant to let me use it, and the fact that it’s in the boys’ dormitory—even if it uses a separate entrance—all combine to give me the unshakeable feeling that this is some seriously unwanted property.\n\n\n “This is it, Sister Ma?ne.”\n\n\n Gil must have been sweeping, I guess, because the front door is slightly cracked open. When Fran pushes the door open, Gil is standing right there, his chest puffed up proudly.\n\n\n “Heh heh, how do you like it?”\n\n\n On the other side of the door is a small hallway that seems to serve double duty as a reception area, and a little ways past that I can see a staircase leading upward. Half of the room has been swept spotlessly clean, but the other half leaves something to be desired.\n\n\n “This part is really clean,” I remark.\n\n\n When I move to open a door on the right side of the hallway, Gil stops me. “I haven’t gotten to that one yet,” he says. I look around the room and spot another door, this one on the left side. When I turn to face it, Gil stops me again. “Didn’t get that one either,” he says. I look around again, but don’t see any other doors on the first floor.\n\n\n “Gil, where exactly did you clean?”\n\n\n “Your room, obviously! Why shouldn’t I put off the rooms the rest of us are going to be using for later?”\n\n\n Gil heads up the staircase, grumbling about how he’d put so much effort into cleaning the half of the hallway that leads from the door to the stairway, and how the only thing I’m paying attention to is how dirty everything else is. It seems like he gave preferential treatment to the rooms that I, his master, would be using. He might have an unexpectedly cute side after all. When I look at the staircase, which has been polished so thoroughly it gleams, I can’t help but chuckle a little.\n\n\n At the top of the staircase is a noble’s room. It is quite clearly large, with a variety of furnishings placed throughout it. In the center of the room, positioned for receiving visitors, is a round, luxuriously decorated table with four chairs set around it. Along the walls is a wardrobe, a set of shelves, and a wooden box carved with a large, magnificent tree. In the corner sits a large bed.\n\n\n There isn’t a huge difference between the way this room and the head priest’s room is laid out. Judging by the fact that there is so much extravagantly finely-crafted furniture in here, it’s very easy to see that this room’s previous owner was a young noblewoman.\n\n\n “Nobody else is using this furniture?” I ask. “These are all very, very nice.”\n\n\n “They belong to the room’s previous owner,” says Fran.\n\n\n “The previous… well, whatever. I won’t ask. I shall be happy to use it myself.”\n\n\n I don’t feel particularly inclined to waste a bunch of money replacing it with furniture of my own, so I should probably not ask any questions I don’t want answered.\n\n\n I ask Fran to leave Benno’s gifts placed on one of the spotless shelves. I’ll use the wardrobe for storing my blue robes and nice clothes.\n\n\n “Thank you, Gil. This place looks great.”\n\n\n “Um?! Ah? Y, yeah. I mean, I cleaned it, after all, so of course it looks great.”\n\n\n He strikes a proud pose, throwing his chest out, but he’s very obviously blushing fiercely. He has his face turned a bit away from me, but I can still see his face burning, as if this is basically the first time he’s ever been praised before. He keeps quickly glancing at me, a look in his eyes as if he’s trying to tell me to praise him more. It’s immediately obvious that he is not used to hearing praise. Since he was assigned to me as a way to harass me, it’s not hard to imagine that he was a problem child who was constantly scolded, and never praised.\n\n\n One of the foundations of home discipline is heaping praise on a kid when they do things correctly.\n\n\n “Gil, I’d like to praise you some more, so crouch down for me, please?”\n\n\n “Huh? Like this?”\n\n\n Gil takes a knee. It briefly occurs to me that the fact that he went so quickly to the stance used for prayer is probably due to how he was raised here. Now that his head is lower than mine, I reach my hand out towards his light blond hair. Gil, having no idea what I’m about to do to him, watches my hand as it approaches, a dubious expression on his face.\n\n\n “You’re such a good boy, Gil,” I say, stroking his head. “You did such a good job.”\n\n\n If I were to try this on Lutz, he’d probably tell me not to treat him like a kid and get all sullen. Gil, though, looks momentarily startled, his eyes going wide, before starting to look like he’s on the verge of tears. He looks down, hiding his face, which causes me to pull my hand back, but when I do, in a quiet voice, he says, “more, please.”\n\n\n “It looks so nice in here,” I say. “You must have worked really hard to do it all by yourself.”\n\n\n Gil’s ears are bright red as he kneels there quietly, having his head stroked. I really, really want to take a peek to see what kind of face he’s making right now, but I smash down that urge, ordering myself not to try.\n\n\n I have learned a valuable lesson. The things I should be giving to Gil aren’t just food and shelter beyond what the orphanage is providing him. What he needs are my thanks and praise."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Still, this is a huge room, though.”\n\n\n Lutz, looking extremely excited, starts exploring the rooms of the director’s office. The second floor contains the master’s room, a room for the director’s handmaid, and a storage room.\n\n\n Gil doesn’t want us to look at the rooms on the first floor, since they haven’t yet been cleaned, but, to his dislike, we do so anyway. The door immediately to the right of the entrance leads to four rooms for attendants, as well as another storage area. The door on the left side of the hall connects to a kitchen, large enough that several cooks could work in it simultaneously, as well as a door to an underground cellar.\n\n\n “Once this is cleaned, we could certainly use this to serve tea for any visitors who come calling,” says Fran, sounding quite satisfied. “We should procure a tea set.”\n\n\n My eyes, though, have fixed on something completely different. The kitchen contains an oven, as well as many things like what the guild master has in his kitchen.\n\n\n “Ah, that’s an oven, isn’t it?” I remark.\n\n\n “It is ordinary for a kitchen to have an oven, is it not?” replies Fran, tilting his head.\n\n\n All of the kitchens in the temple are for blue-robed noble priests, so it’s obvious that they’d all contain ovens, but for me and Lutz, they’re something rare that we’ve been actively searching for.\n\n\n “Lutz! I found an oven! We need to tell Mister Benno about this!”\n\n\n “Yeah!”\n\n\n Lutz has been working alongside Benno and Mark to help open the Italian restaurant, so his eyes sparkle brilliantly as he spins around, taking in the noble kitchen.\n\n\n “Now, Fran. Once this has been cleaned, would I be permitted to bring in cooks, perhaps?”\n\n\n “Of course, Sister Ma?ne. It is perfectly ordinary for a blue-robed apprentice priestess to bring in cooks and other such subordinates.”\n\n\n A plan starts forming in my head. I could train cooks here, and the food could then be given to my attendants and to the orphans.\n\n\n Fran tilts his head, again. “Sister Ma?ne, as you did not bring any cooks with you today, how might you be planning to have lunch?”\n\n\n Since the system here at the temple is one where the blue-robed clergy’s cooks prepare their meals for them, with the remainder being granted to the lower ranks, it’s impossible for me to have lunch without any cooks of my own.\n\n\n “Let us have lunch outside. You two, please get changed.”\n\n\n “Changed?”\n\n\n I head back up to the second floor, then pull the cloth-wrapped packages out of Lutz’s basket. I set them on the table, pushing them towards Gil and Fran.\n\n\n “These are not the blessings of the gods. These are rewards that I’ve prepared for the two of you as thanks for your hard work. You don’t have to share these with anyone.”\n\n\n “I am deeply grateful, Sister Ma?ne,” says Fran.\n\n\n “Huh? What? It’s okay if I…?” says Gil.\n\n\n The two of them, their expressions flickering between confusion, joy, and hope, carefully unwrap their bundles. They remind me of children that have received their first ever present… and, in the next moment, I realize that this might actually be true. In the orphanage, where all is shared equally amongst everyone, the concept of giving presents probably doesn’t exist.\n\n\n Even though my family is poor, I’ve still gotten presents from my parents at major life landmarks, like the first time they let me go to the forest and at my baptismal ceremony. Fran, Gil, and the other orphans wouldn’t have gotten any of those.\n\n\n “…So, these are… clothes, right?” says Gil.\n\n\n “Correct,” I reply. “Go get changed, and we’ll go outside the temple.”\n\n\n “Really?! I’ve always wanted to go outside. I’m going to go get changed right now!”\n\n\n The smile on his face as he hugs his new clothes to his chest is the most brilliant I’ve seen on him so far. He bounds out of the room with long strides, flying down the steps. It makes me happy to see how overjoyed he is that I got him those clothes. I look over at Fran, who has yet to say a word.\n\n\n Fran stands there quietly, looking down at the clothing spread out on the table as if transfixed by something dazzlingly brilliant, idly tracing a finger along the embroidery on the hems. When I see how he’s trying to bite down on his happiness, I have to hold back an awkward laugh.\n\n\n “Fran, would you please try those on?”\n\n\n “Ah?!” He startles, suddenly realizing he’s being watched, and turns bright red in embarrassment. “Of… of course.”\n\n\n He hurries down the stairs. Seeing the usually cool and composed Fran so flustered makes me and Lutz giggle a bit.\n\n\n “They were really happy to get those,” says Lutz.\n\n\n “Yeah!”\n\n\n He takes a quick look down the stairs, then lowers his voice.\n\n\n “…But, did Gil just say he’d always wanted to go outside? …This place is strange, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “It really is. But I’m sure that to the people living here, we’re the strange ones.”\n\n\n In preparation to go outside, I pull off my blue robes, fold them up, and set them in the closet. I think about how I should get a hanger so that they don’t get any weird wrinkles, and decide to ask Benno to have one made for me. Then, I take out enough money from my donation funds to cover today’s activities.\n\n\n I leave the temple, my attendants following behind. Both of them hesitate for a moment as they pass through the gates.\n\n\n “Fran, stop worrying so much about that, it’ll be fine, alright?”\n\n\n Fran hasn’t ever worn anything but what gray-robed priests wear, so he’s constantly very conscious about the cuffs and hems of his clothes, but the calm color of his clothes, like black tea, suits his general ambiance. Gil, meanwhile, looks perfect in his green clothes, the color of spring leaves, as he energetically runs around.\n\n\n “Whoaaa, I’m outside! Just this is enough to make me happy to be your attendant!”\n\n\n “Then,” says Fran, “you should work earnestly for her, and also be more polite in your speech. You wouldn’t want to cause her embarrassment.”\n\n\n “…Right, I’ll get to that.”\n\n\n Gil races around the area excitedly, looking restlessly around at everything that catches his interest. There’s no way that I, who can’t walk any faster than a leisurely stroll, could match his speed. So, Lutz tries his best to keep Gil from running off on his own, and Fran carries me in his arms.\n\n\n “It’s a very strange feeling,” says Fran, “walking around on our own outside the temple.”\n\n\n “…This is the world I live in,” I reply. “Fran, you too, when you’re outside, could you also change your speech a bit, too? If you’re too polite, you’ll stand out too much.”\n\n\n “Changing one’s… changing my speech pattern is surprisingly difficult.”\n\n\n Lutz guides us to a restaurant near the central plaza. It’s a comparatively high-class place, he tells us, frequently used by merchants. It’s an unusual sort of restaurant, where there aren’t any large tables, but only small tables where a few people can sit. I can see a few groups of customers in the midst of business negotiations.\n\n\n Lutz, who has been here before, gives us a few recommendations, and we quickly get an order placed. A platter of boiled sausage and cheese is delivered to our table, and a basket of thinly sliced bread follows shortly after. Then, individual bowls of vegetable soup are placed in front of each of us.\n\n\n “Time to eat!” say Lutz and I, reaching for the bread.\n\n\n “What? That’s it?” Gil objects.\n\n\n Lutz and I freeze, looking at each other, our hands halfway to the bread basket.\n\n\n “Were we supposed to do something else?”\n\n\n “You didn’t say the blessing, right? To the supreme gods who rule over all in the high, lofty skies, to the great gods who rule over all in the wide, vast earth, to all the gods who grant sustenance to the thousands upon tens of thousands of lives of creation, we offer this heartfelt prayer of thanks for this meal.”\n\n\n From how he is so smoothly reciting every phrase of this prayer, his hands crossed before his chest, I can see that this is something that everyone at the temple is expected to say before each meal.\n\n\n “…Didn’t know that one at all,” says Lutz. “First time I’ve heard it.”\n\n\n “That’s something I definitely need to learn,” I say.\n\n\n I ask Gil and Fran to teach me as I try to work my way through reciting the blessing. I can tell I’m not going to memorize this immediately. It’s just not possible if I can’t jot it down in a notebook.\n\n\n Lutz and I pull ourselves back together and start eating, but Fran and Gil aren’t moving a muscle. They’re just sitting in front of their food, watching silently.\n\n\n Thinking this strange, I speak up. “Huh? Aren’t you going to eat? Are you… not hungry?”\n\n\n Fran shakes his head. “…As we are your attendants, we cannot eat until you are finished with your meal.”\n\n\n “If you don’t eat with us, it’ll get cold, though…?”\n\n\n Gil looks like he wants to dig in, but he looks over at Fran, sitting next to him, and holds himself back. His restless fidgeting somehow reminds me of one of those toys that move in response to sound.\n\n\n “Alright, then, this is an order. Eat while it’s still hot and fresh.”\n\n\n Fran, seemingly unable to refuse an order he’s been given, reluctantly takes a slice of bread. In the next instant, Gil gleefully reaches out to take some food.\n\n\n Fran eats with a level of politeness I’ve never seen around here before. Even Gil, who was raised by the orphanage, eats in a manner that I’d have to call polite. Compared to them, Lutz, who constantly fights with his brothers at the dinner table, is just greedily chowing down. Is this what happens when everything is divided equally amongst everyone, with no need to fight for anything?\n\n\n “You two eat so politely,” I say. “Were you taught that?”\n\n\n “Nothing that a blue-robed priest would consider unsightly is allowed to leave the orphanage,” says Fran, “so our elders teach us both table manners as well as how to walk properly.”\n\n\n “Yeah, that’s right,” says Gil. “I really hate purifying myself before I can leave the orphanage. It’s fine for now, but I’m totally going to die in winter.”\n\n\n “An attendant must be able to take a bath, after all,” adds Fran.\n\n\n What a terrifyingly strict environment, if they insist that unsightly things cannot leave the orphanage. But, thanks to that, even Gil is actually pretty polite.\n\n\n As we eat, they keep talking about the differences between living at the orphanage and being an attendant, but at some point I notice some subtle movement in Fran’s eyebrows. Even though Fran is usually only given leftovers, he’s still used to eating noble food, so it seems like he might be dissatisfied with the taste of the food here. His eyebrows are just a little bit furrowed as he eats.\n\n\n “Fran, is this that different from what you normally eat?”\n\n\n I tap my own eyebrow with a fingertip, smiling a little at him. Fran immediately smooths out his expression, then smiles embarrassedly.\n\n\n “It is. It’s very different. …The warm soup, though, I think is delicious.”\n\n\n The food he got from his masters was probably delicious, but since it’s all leftovers, this might be the first time he’s eating something hot.\n\n\n “As long as I can fill myself up, I don’t care what it tastes like,” says Gil. “Since there aren’t as many blue-robed priests as before, there’s waaay less of the gods’ blessings, and there’s been a lot of gray-robed priests that have come back to the orphanage, too.”\n\n\n It looks like Gil’s satisfied with how much he’s eaten, but compared to Lutz, who’s the same age as him, he’s eaten a whole lot less. It’s possible that his stomach just hasn’t had to grow, since he usually doesn’t get to eat that much.\n\n\n “Then, how about we go buy dinner for you two on the way back, and also bring back some presents for the orphanage? Since I’m going home this afternoon, dinner’s going to be a problem for you, right?”\n\n\n “Really?! Woohoo! We pray to the gods!”\n\n\n Gil, overflowing with gratitude at being able to fill his belly after so long, leaps up from his chair with a clatter, and then, right in the middle of the restaurant, assumes the Gl█co pose. The restaurant, which had been buzzing with the sound of eating and negotiation, falls dead silent, and every single person there turns to look at our table.\n\n\n “H… hang on!” says Lutz. “Stop praying here!”\n\n\n Lutz frantically escorts Gil out of the shop. I settle the bill, leaving an extra tip on top to apologize to the shopkeeper for the disturbance, and flee the scene.\n\n\n “Keep your prayers in the temple,” I say, sighing heavily. “Got it? Just like how Lutz and I don’t know a lot of things that are common knowledge in the temple, there’s a lot of things out here that you two won’t know about, either.”\n\n\n Gil, easy to read, droops his shoulders and hangs his head in shame.\n\n\n “…Sorry,” he says.\n\n\n “It’s all right,” I reassure him, “just be careful in the future.”\n\n\n “Not about that! …I mean, sorry that I was making fun of you for not knowing things, earlier.”\n\n\n It seems he’s rethinking a lot of things from back at the temple. Seeing him apologize so seriously, Lutz laughingly pats him on the shoulder.\n\n\n “Man, none of us know anything,” he says. “If you think Ma?ne’s doing something weird, tell her about it right away. Like that blessing earlier. I’ll keep an eye out for you, too, in case you start doing something weird.”\n\n\n “Gil,” I say, “there’s some street stands over there selling things for travelers, so let’s go there to buy your dinner and the presents.”\n\n\n Since the eastern gates open onto the highway, there’s lots of travelers, and lots of activity. However, since there’s lots of outsiders around, public order isn’t all that great. I look around, trying to find a stall as close to the central plaza as possible where we can buy what we need. I buy a few sandwich-like things, with ham and cheese stacked between two thin slices of bread, wrapping them in a cloth that I’d brought with me and putting them in my tote bag.\n\n\n “Fran, how many people live in the orphanage right now? What should I bring back for them?”\n\n\n “…I believe there are somewhere between eighty or ninety people, at the moment. They generally aren’t given anything sweet to eat, so perhaps I might suggest a fruit that is easy to cut up, or perhaps small fruits like those over there?”\n\n\n As Fran holds me up, I use my high viewpoint to look over the surrounding stalls. I can see three stalls selling fruits. We wander between them, comparing them to see what’s reasonably priced.\n\n\n “These… are the gods’ blessings,” says Gil.\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n As soon as we hear him speak, Fran and I look over our shoulders. Behind us, we see that Gil has arbitrarily picked up one of the fruits piled up at one of the stalls and is messily biting into it. Lutz, who had been holding Gil’s hand so that he didn’t go running off on his own, stands there frozen, eyes wide open in disbelief.\n\n\n “Gil?!”\n\n\n “Hey, kid! You didn’t pay for that. Are you trying to rob me in broad daylight, right in front of my store!?”\n\n\n The woman working at the cart punches Gil without even waiting for a reply. Gil looks at me, dumbfounded, holding the half-eaten, peach-like, bralle. I immediately ask Fran to let me down, taking out some money.\n\n\n “I’m very sorry, ma'am. He’s lived a very sheltered life and doesn’t know much about the world. He’s only just learning about money. I’ll pay for it, so please don’t call the guards.”\n\n\n “Sorry, ma'am,” says Lutz. “I was supposed to be keeping an eye on him.”\n\n\n I pay her as the two of us apologize profusely. She looks down at Gil in shock, then shrugs her shoulders.\n\n\n “My word. I don’t care how rich of a family he’s come from, if you’re walking around with him, you should really pay more attention.”\n\n\n “We’re really very sorry, ma'am,” I say. “Hey, Gil, you should apologize, too.”\n\n\n “Ah? Um, s… sorry.”\n\n\n With prompting, he shakily apologizes, looking completely lost as to what to do.\n\n\n “Gil, did you like that bralle?”\n\n\n “Y… yeah…”\n\n\n He stares down at the half-eaten fruit, looking worried. “It’s okay to eat it now, I paid for it,” I tell him as I fish two more wrapping cloths out of my tote bag, tying the corners together to make two cloth bags.\n\n\n “Ma'am, could I get five bralles in each of these bags, please?”\n\n\n “Sure thing.”\n\n\n We apologetically buy the presents for the orphanage from her place, then head back towards the central plaza. I have Gil, as punishment, carry the bags. I figure that as long as both of his hands are full, he’s going to be a lot less likely to do something unexpected.\n\n\n “When I give you your wages I’ll make sure to teach you how money works, but until then, don’t touch any of the goods at any stores,” I tell him.\n\n\n “…Okay.”\n\n\n As we start heading north along the main road back towards the temple, with me in Fran’s arms, Lutz looks up at me.\n\n\n “Hey, Ma?ne. Before we head back to the temple, can we go talk to Master Benno?”\n\n\n “Yeah. I was planning on asking him to get a tea set and cooking utensils for me, so that’s a pretty good idea.”\n\n\n Lutz races off to the store, which is bustling with activity as it gets opened back up after lunch break. I ask Fran to set me down, and head over to the store at my normal, leisurely pace. Gil, both hands still full of bags, follows along behind me.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, Master Benno is waiting for you,” says Mark, stepping outside to greet me as I approach.\n\n\n “Good afternoon, Mister Mark,” I reply.\n\n\n I head into the back office, with Fran and Gil in tow. Inside, Lutz is standing in front of Benno’s writing desk, finishing up his report. As soon as Benno sees me, he stands straight up, strides over, grabs me under his arm, and lifts me up high.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you’ve really done it this time! Just being able to look at a kitchen that a nobleman used will be a great reference for that Italian restaurant.”\n\n\n He ruffles my hair so hard that my head rattles. He’s so overexcited that Fran, who’d only known Benno from how he’d been acting at the temple, takes a shocked step back.\n\n\n I push his hand away, ask him to put me down, and go to sit down at the same table as always.\n\n\n “I’ve been told that I can bring cooks in to use the kitchen in the director’s office, so I wanted to come here to talk about maybe using that to start training cooks right away. The food they make would be used as meals for my attendants, and anything after that would go to the orphanage, so none of the ingredients would have to go to waste.”\n\n\n “Hmm, I see…” he says, nodding, taking notes on a wooden board.\n\n\n “Since it’s going to be food for my attendants, I’d pay for the ingredients, so it’s not going to cost you anything at all. That sounds great, doesn’t it?”\n\n\n Providing food for the orphanage is the duty of a blue-robed priestess, so I need to do what I can to fulfill it. Plus, if I think of the orphanage as being full of starving children like Gil, then on a purely personal level I want to do something about that, too.\n\n\n Benno, however, thinks about it for a while, then slowly shakes his head.\n\n\n “No, hold up. The cost of the ingredients is an expense of training the cooks, so I’ll pay that. If I let you pay for everything, then I’m not going to be able to complain if you decide to keep those cooks working for you there.”\n\n\n I shrug at his very merchant-like answer. If he’s offering to take on the cost of the ingredients, then it’s actually better for me to let him. Right now, although Ma?ne’s Workshop is technically open for business, at least on paper, I’m not actually making any money.\n\n\n “…Then, how about I provide the funds for the equipment and cookware for the kitchen, and you pay for the ingredients used for training purposes?”\n\n\n “Sounds about right, since I’m just going to be borrowing that kitchen for a while as a training facility. Alright! Let’s go check it out.”\n\n\n Benno, perhaps wanting very much to see an oven, stands up as if to end the conversation. He’s got the exact same expression on that Gil did when he found out he got to go see the town. All of this, somehow, leaves me perplexed.\n\n\n “Mister Benno, we can’t go right now. The kitchen hasn’t been cleaned yet.”\n\n\n “It is as Sister Ma?ne says,” says Fran, nodding emphatically in unison with Gil. “It is not yet a place where we can invite a guest such as yourself, nor can we serve you a satisfactory cup of tea.”\n\n\n However, Benno is plainly full of curiosity, interest, and practical desire to see reference material for the Italian restaurant, and pays no heed whatsoever to our opinions. He smiles broadly at us as he throws on a jacket suitable for wearing to the temple over his street clothes.\n\n\n “I’m not a guest. I’m a merchant! You’re an apprentice blue-robed priestess who’s only just got her own rooms, and I’m just the man who’s there to take down the order for all the things you need to furnish them. It’s only natural that the cleaning’s not done yet, isn’t it? Plus, I want to see how it looks before you do anything strange in there.”\n\n\n “So, then, are you going to help me clean, or what?”\n\n\n “Hmm? Of course I can help you clean. I got my start as an apprentice sweeping out this shop, you know.”\n\n\n It’s no use. I can’t say anything to stop him. Benno wants to know everything he can about the nobility, and he is not going to let this perfect opportunity escape from him.\n\n\n “…Fran, let’s give it up. It’s not like we’re going to have a tea set ready by the time we’re done with cleaning, anyway, so now that’s he’s gotten like this, we might as well let him help clean.”\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne?!”\n\n\n Figuring how to stop Benno has gotten just bothersome enough that I’ve stopped caring. Every moment we spend on this pointless chatter is a moment out of my afternoon that I don’t get to spend reading.\n\n\n “Fran, you might not know this saying, but sometimes you just have to take whatever help you can get. He himself says he wants to go, and he says that he can help us clean, so let’s let him work. I just want to go read a book.”\n\n\n Fran’s eyes momentarily go wide, then the corners of his mouth start twitching as if he’s holding back laughter.\n\n\n “…I am terribly sorry, Sister Ma?ne, but you are not allowed to enter the library without me present. If Master Benno accompanies us as we return to the temple, I’m afraid that you will not be able to read.”\n\n\n “Noooo!!”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n In the end, no matter what I tried to say, Benno completely ignored it, instead snatching me up and hauling me off. So, now, we’ve returned to the temple, and I can’t read any books.\n\n\n Just as Benno said, after he surveys the rooms of the director’s office, he takes off his jacket, gives some directions to Gil and Lutz, and starts cleaning. Everyone else, caught up in his wake, quickly get to work as well. Benno and Fran take on the tasks that involve reaching high places and the work that involves a lot of physical strength, while Gil and Lutz take the low places and the detail work.\n\n\n I have no strength, no stamina, and would only get in everyone’s way if I tried to help, so I am left sobbing at the upstairs table, yearning desperately for a book as I fill out the order form for all the things I can think of that I’m going to need Lutz to deliver."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The kitchen was cleaned thoroughly over the course of several days so that it was usable for handling food. While that happened, I had cooking utensils and tableware delivered and had firewood and raw ingredients brought, bit by bit, into the cellar. Also, through Benno, I managed to arrange for cooks to come to my kitchen to work.\n\n\n Starting from the day I saw the kitchen, I started work at home to cultivate natural yeast. If I’m going to have professional cooks baking for me, then I want to eat fluffy bread.\n\n\n With Benno’s guidance, I went to a store that deals in glassware and bought a container that I could put a lid on, thinking that I could make natural yeast from lutebelles, which are currently in season.\n\n\n I first sterilized the bottle by boiling it. Then, I washed and roughly cut up several lutebelles, put them in the bottle along with some water and sugar, and sealed them in. Over the next few days, I shook the bottle thoroughly once a day, opening the lid briefly to let outside air in, waiting for the day when I could use it as liquid yeast.\n\n\n It took about five days to finally finish fermenting, but now that I’ve filtered it out, I’m left with a liquid that’s full of usable yeast. If I mix this together with whole-wheat flour and water and let it rest, I should be able to make a bread starter.\n\n\n It seems like fluffy bread is rare even in noble houses. At the guild master’s house, I had some bread made solely of white flour, but even that wasn’t as soft and fluffy as the bread I’ve been craving. If I properly ferment natural yeasts and can use them to make a truly fluffy bread, I think it’ll have a strong appeal. On top of that, if I can keep control of the knowledge of how to ferment natural yeasts and make bread starters, then bread will be the one thing that will be my restaurant’s forte, that few people will be able to quickly copy.\n\n\n Whether or not this will actually go according to plan is another matter, though.\n\n\n As soon as I let Benno know that the bread starter is finished, he immediately mobilizes the cooks and brings them to my rooms at the temple. He brings two people: a young man, not even twenty years old, and a young girl in her early teens who is clearly his apprentice. If these two can learn the recipes to a reasonable degree, then we’ll be able to bring more people in.\n\n\n “Hugo,” says Benno, very politely, “here you will be able to learn recipes used by the nobility. Please do your best to learn them well. …Madam Ma?ne, allow me to introduce to you Hugo, a cook from my establishment, and his assistant and apprentice, Ella.”\n\n\n As Benno just introduced his cooks to me, I really would like to introduce myself to them in return, but instead I stay silent, nodding once, and let Fran reply for me. After all, I am a blue-robed priestess, so I need to behave like a noble.\n\n\n “Hugo and Ella, is it?” he replies. “Now then, I shall lead you to the kitchen immediately.”\n\n\n I’ve been told that even instructing the cooks should be left to Fran, so he will be reading cooking directions off of wooden boards that I’ve written recipes on. Gil can’t read yet, so I have to entirely entrust Fran with dealing with the cooks.\n\n\n “The first thing that you must learn is hygienic discipline. Your cookware and utensils must be kept clean and sanitary. This kitchen must be kept in the polished condition that it is now. Before coming here, you must ensure your bodies are clean and your clothes are washed; if you arrive dirty in figure or dress, you will not be allowed into the kitchen. Do you understand thus far?”\n\n\n “Y… yes!”\n\n\n If we can beat proper hygienic practices into their heads here, then when they’re told to do the same things in the Italian restaurant, they won’t put up much resistance there.\n\n\n In the Italian restaurant I’m making, we won’t be serving food on hard slices of bread. We won’t be dropping unwanted food on the ground, and we won’t have a dog running around to eat it up. I’ve heard that that’s unfortunately just the culture around here, but in a high-class restaurant where food fit for the nobility is served, I have no use for such a culture.\n\n\n What I really want to get these two started on is consommé, but Benno said that he wanted them to be able to finish making something for him to eat in time for lunch, so I’m going to leave making consommé, which takes a considerably long time, for tomorrow. Today, in order to use the oven for the first time, I want to start by making pizza. Or, more accurately, I want to eat pizza.\n\n\n “Now then,” says Fran, “today we will be making pizza. To begin, please light the oven.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir.”\n\n\n At Fran’s direction, the two cooks retrieve firewood from the cellar and fire up the oven. Since a wood-fired oven takes a fairly long time to heat up, starting the fire has to be the first step. Lighting the oven here isn’t much different than anywhere else, so the two of them are able to get it going quickly.\n\n\n “Before handling the ingredients, please wash your hands.”\n\n\n As Benno and I, seated at the table in the room used for servants, look on, they start working on making the dough for the pizza. Since Fran and I had already gotten all of the ingredients ready and set them out on the counter, it feels like I’m watching a cooking show. Into a bowl of flour, they mix in some of the natural yeast that I’d brought, then some salt, then some sugar, and finally some lukewarm water, before kneading it thoroughly and setting it aside to rise.\n\n\n Hugo looks up, letting out a heavy sigh. “This takes just as much work as making bread,” he says.\n\n\n “It would not be unwise to consider this to be essentially the same sort of thing. Now, after kneading, you must leave it alone for some time to let the dough ferment. In the meantime, we shall make pommé sauce, then chop the ingredients for the pizza and the soup.”\n\n\n They blanch and peel the yellow pommé fruits that we are using in place of tomatoes, cut them down to size, set them to simmer over a low flame, and then start to chop up the vegetables.\n\n\n “Mister Hugo,” says Ella, “I’ll handle prepping the liga.”\n\n\n “Please do,” he replies.\n\n\n She skillfully wields the large kitchen knife, one that I still can’t even hold, and quickly prepares the small white radishes with the garlicky smell. Hugo, as instructed, chops up some bacon, some onion-like lanierres, some carrot-like mellens, and a variety of different kinds of mushrooms. His knife technique is just as fast and precise as you’d expect out of a professional chef. I let out a sigh of admiration.\n\n\n “Master Benno,” I say, “these cooks are even more excellent than I had expected.”\n\n\n The instant I speak, Hugo and Ella turn to look at me, startled. I’d been trying to praise them, but when I see how stiff and frozen they’ve become, I realize that saying anything had been a mistake.\n\n\n “Your praise is most gracious, Madam Ma?ne,” says Benno. “…You two, she thinks well of you.”\n\n\n Benno’s follow-through thaws the frozen atmosphere. Hugo and Ella both look visibly relieved, and after telling me how gracious my praise is, they return to their chopping, a serious look in their eyes. Benno glares slightly at me, making a gesture to indicate that I should shut my mouth. I nod emphatically.\n\n\n I’m really sorry. I had no idea that words of praise would cause that kind of reaction.\n\n\n After they finish chopping the vegetables, Hugo starts preparing the chicken meat next, slicing breast meat into thin strips and soaking them in oil. Ella works on readying some herbs that would taste good with the meat.\n\n\n “Next, we will be making soup,” says Fran.\n\n\n The recipe I’ve written down is for a salty vegetable soup that’s boiled together with slices of sausage to bring out a rich savoriness. I want to know if thoroughly boiling the vegetables will actually bring out all of their umami.\n\n\n “Please boil the soup like so. We will not be discarding the broth.”\n\n\n “You want us to leave it like that?”\n\n\n The two cooks look at Fran with dubious expressions on their faces. Despite that, even though they look bothered by it, they still can’t go against the instructions of a noble, so they continue cooking with sour expressions on their faces. My mother made the same face as I watched her try my kind of soup-making.\n\n\n “Ella, please skim the lye from the soup. Hugo, the pommé sauce has boiled down, so please thoroughly mix that liga and some of that oil into it. That will finish up the sauce. Ah, and it seems that this is excellent timing for the dough.”\n\n\n Hugo, given direction after direction, punches down the dough to let out the gas, divides it in half, and starts to stretch it out.\n\n\n “After spreading the dough into a circle, coat it with pommé sauce, then top it with these ingredients.”\n\n\n As Fran requests, Hugo spreads pommé sauce over the surface of the dough, then tops it with bacon, onions, and mushrooms. On the other piece of the dough, he spreads the sauce, then adds chicken breast, onions, and herbs. Then, he sprinkles a generous amount of cheese over both pizzas, and puts them in the oven.\n\n\n I notice that Ella has been staring at Hugo as he works, watching with great interest. She’s wearing the same expression as Tuuli when she’s talking with Corinna about sewing and as Ilse when she’s looking at a new recipe. When I see how closely she’s watching, full of an aspiration to better her skills, I can’t help but cheer her on in my mind.\n\n\n Since we have some time, I want them to make mayonnaise and use that, since we can’t make potato salad, to make kalfe salad, but since this is the first time they’ve been in this kitchen and are making food they’ve never made before while a noble is watching them, they’re obviously very stressed, so I don’t have any choice but to cut that short. I stealthily signal to Fran to cut back on the number of dishes, and he nods slightly at me.\n\n\n “As the soup has now been thoroughly boiled, please test its flavor in order to adjust its saltiness.”\n\n\n Hugo spoons a small amount of soup into a small dish, then timidly raises it to his mouth. As soon as he takes a sip, he freezes, his eyes flying open wide. It takes him a while to swallow, as if he spent extra time letting the flavors roll around his tongue.\n\n\n “…What is this?” he murmurs, sampling it again.\n\n\n And again. As soon as I realize that there’s not going to be much soup left if he keeps sampling so enthusiastically, Ella slaps Hugo smartly on the back.\n\n\n “Mister Hugo, you’re eating too much! How’s the seasoning?”\n\n\n “Huh?! …Ah, right.”\n\n\n Hugo frowns sharply, looking between his tasting dish and the pot. I’m guessing that this is the first time tasting anything like this. Figuring out what to add to that flavor must be very difficult.\n\n\n “Just a little bit. Just the tiniest bit of salt will do.”\n\n\n Trembling with stress, he hesitantly adds a single pinch of salt, stirs it in, then takes another sip.\n\n\n “Perfect,” he says.\n\n\n “Let me try too, please,” says Ella.\n\n\n When I see her pick up another small dish, looking like a dog that’s waiting for her dinner, I have to fight back a giggle. If I start cracking up now, I’m going to ruin the mood again.\n\n\n Hugo spoons a little soup into her dish, and she drinks a mouthful of it. Her face immediately lights up brilliantly.\n\n\n “Whoa?! What’s this?! This is really good! That’s the vegetables I’m tasting, right? It’s got some sweetness to it, and the taste of the sausage has disappeared into the rest of the soup… I can’t believe you can make a soup this good with so little salt!”\n\n\n “Calm down, Ella!”\n\n\n Hugo tries to restrain Ella as she, speaking very quickly, excitedly describes how delicious the soup is. He glances briefly at me, then back to her, trying to convey a warning with his eyes, but it does not reach Ella at all through her excitement at discovering a new flavor.\n\n\n “I can’t calm down! This is a huge discovery, isn’t it?!”\n\n\n “Please, I’m begging you, calm down. You’re before nobility.”\n\n\n “…Ah…”\n\n\n All the blood drains from Ella’s face as she looks at me. I didn’t even say anything this time, but everything’s frozen up again. I really just want to say that it’s okay to be so excited, and that she should keep trying hard, but what exactly would a noble say at a time like this?\n\n\n Fran comes near, and I whisper to him. “Could you please tell them that I’m thankful to have cooks with such enthusiasm for their job, and that I’m looking forward to what they’ll be cooking for me?”\n\n\n He nods. “Understood. Sister Ma?ne, Master Benno, your meal is nearly ready. If I may, I would like to ask you to please be seated at the table in the other room.”\n\n\n Fran motions towards the door. As he does so, Gil, who has been standing there, quickly opens it for us. I get down from my chair, trying not to mope over how I’m being kicked out of the kitchen before everything’s done, and Benno reaches out as if to provide me an escort.\n\n\n Since Fran is giving directions, he can’t leave the kitchen, so Gil is the one to show us to my room. He closes the kitchen door behind us, following closely behind me. I try not to smile when I see the triumphant expression he’s wearing, as if he’s trying to say “look at me, I’m doing my job.”\n\n\n Just like I had asked, the table in my room has been set with a vase full of flowers, place mats, and cutlery, as well as a pitcher of juice to quench our thirst. All of this was put together by Gil while the rest of us were busy in the kitchen, observing the cooks as they worked.\n\n\n “Thank you, Gil,” I say.\n\n\n Grinning, he gets down on one knee. Over the past few days, we’ve developed something of an unspoken agreement that, when it’s time for praise, he takes this stance. “You did a great job,” I say, patting his head. “Thanks for your hard work.” He smiles widely back at me.\n\n\n Yesterday, he used rinsham on his hair so he could look presentable for the cooks that were coming in from outside the temple today, so his hair is silky smooth. It really does feel good to the touch.\n\n\n I reach the table, take a drink, and let out a tired sigh. As a powerful awareness of my own heritage sets in, I slump my shoulders exhaustedly.\n\n\n “Being a rich girl is exhausting. I want to talk with them! I just really want to help them cook…”\n\n\n “Give it up,” says Benno. “To those two, they’re in a noble kitchen, cooking noble food, in an environment full of nobles. Everything they’re doing is to study. And while they’re here to practice cooking, you’re here to practice how to carry yourself like a noble. Don’t let your guard down when you’re in the temple, idiot.”\n\n\n “Urgh… I’ll do my best.”\n\n\n I take a deep breath, straightening up in my chair. At about the time I put some energy back into my rich girl act, I hear the kitchen door open from downstairs. As Fran brings our food upstairs, Gil quickly moves to stand by the wall.\n\n\n “Fran,” I say, “for dessert, I believe I would like a lutebelle.”\n\n\n “Of course, Sister,” he replies.\n\n\n The sugar in the kitchen here is sugar that I had to bring from my own stash at home. Benno hasn’t managed to acquire any yet. Until he manages to secure a route through which he can get a supply, our pastry is being held back. Unlike during the winter, right now fruits are sufficiently delicious to serve as dessert, but I very much hope that we can procure sugar by the time the restaurant is ready.\n\n\n Fran sets the two types of pizza and bowls of soup down on the table. The pizza looks like it may have been baked for just a little too long. There are a few burn marks on the crust, and the steam gently rising off of each pizza carries with it the faint smell of burnt cheese. The faint sound of the bacon still crackling reaches my ears, and I can see the oil glistening on the surface of the chicken. Both of the pizzas look like they’d be delicious. The smell of the cheese is enrapturing. Benno, sitting across from me, looks with great anticipation at the pizzas, his eyes glimmering.\n\n\n “To the supreme gods who rule over all in the high, lofty skies, to the great gods who rule over all in the wide, vast earth, to all the gods who grant sustenance to the thousands upon tens of thousands of lives of creation, we offer this heartfelt prayer of thanks for this meal.”\n\n\n I recite the blessing that I’ve spent the past few days memorizing, then just Benno and I begin to eat. The other two people in the room can’t eat until they are granted food as the gods’ blessings. Even though I want to eat with them, and even if the concept of granting someone food isn’t really something I’m comfortable with, this is what it means to be a blue-robed priestess, and I can’t work against that.\n\n\n With Fran by my side, serving as my waiter, I eat my soup. The savoriness of the meat and the sweetness of the vegetables are tied together by a faint saltiness to form a gentle flavor that matches the soup I make at home. I’d personally prefer if it were a little bit saltier, but that’s something I can hope for next time.\n\n\n “…This is pretty tasty,” says Benno.\n\n\n “The flavor of the vegetables has truly been highlighted, has it not?” I say. “Even Ilse expressed much curiosity about this.”\n\n\n “Hmm? Is it truly so rare a thing?”\n\n\n When I obliquely hint that this soup isn’t something found in noble recipes, he responds like he understands, staring fixedly at the soup.\n\n\n “This is pizza. Please think of it as something like a bread.”\n\n\n I pick up a slice of pizza, using a fork to cut off the thick, goopy strands of cheese that come along with it, and then try a bite. Benno matches me, taking a slice of the bacon pizza, and has a bite as well.\n\n\n “Does it suit your tastes?” I ask.\n\n\n “…This tastes even better than what I was expecting.”\n\n\n I take another slice for myself, and Benno slides two onto his plate. Then, I look up at Fran.\n\n\n “Fran, I give you the gods’ blessings. Please, take your leave until it is time for dessert.”\n\n\n “I am truly thankful,” he says.\n\n\n If I say things like that, then the cooks and my attendants will be able to eat while it’s still warm. Fran and Gil pick up the leftover food, heading downstairs, and after a moment I hear the sound of a door closing. A moment later, Ella squeals in delight, her voice echoing up the stairs. It seems like they started sampling everything right away. I can hear the faint sound of a fun, lively conversation happening downstairs.\n\n\n While the others are busy being enthusiastic about their cooking, now is the perfect time for a private conversation.\n\n\n “Mister Benno,” I say around a mouthful of pizza, “do you think this pizza and this soup will sell?”\n\n\n Benno nods, swallowing. “It will. This is the first time I’m having it, but it’s delicious. …I feel like this pizza is more tender than the bread I ate when I dined with nobles, though.”\n\n\n “It’s thanks to my wonderful little yeasts,” I reply.\n\n\n “What do you mean by that?”\n\n\n “It’s something that means that other shops can’t get ahead of us on this. …Like, even if the cooks that we’ve trained get hired away by someone else, this is a secret that will make sure we’re still on top of the market.”\n\n\n This Italian restaurant is going to be something I’m going to be able to get some money out of. If it isn’t profitable, then I’m going to be in some trouble.\n\n\n “Since the soup only really brings out the flavor of the vegetables, if someone really wanted to copy it, I think it wouldn’t be hard for them to do so. Once they start copying us, then we’re going to fight by having a variety of different flavors of soup.”\n\n\n “Huh… We don’t have many cooks, though. How’s that going to work?”\n\n\n “If we offer courses whose flavors match the season, then even if we don’t have very many cooks, I think we should still be okay.”\n\n\n When I answer, Benno groans, scratching roughly at his head.\n\n\n “…Man, I feel like an idiot for worrying about things all by myself. Using you to solve some of my mountain of problems would really clear things up.”\n\n\n “What problems are you having?”\n\n\n “Let’s not talk about it here. Stop by my shop.”\n\n\n The two of us finish eating, and I ring the bell that’s been left on the table for us. Shortly thereafter, Fran and Gil come up the stairs bearing our desserts. They tidy up our used tableware, then set our dessert plates in front of us.\n\n\n “Fran,” I say, “did you find the taste to be satisfactory?”\n\n\n Out of all of us, the person who understands noble cuisine the most is Fran. All I’m doing is making the food that I want to eat, so it’s still going to be different from actual noble cooking.\n\n\n “…It was very delicious,” he replies. “It was not traditional cuisine, but I believe that the flavor is such that any noble who has an interest in novel foods would find it appealing.”\n\n\n “I see,” I reply, nodding.\n\n\n “The cooks have taken a profound interest in this as well, and have expressed a burning desire to try again after reviewing what they have made so far, so I believe that they will continue to work hard from tomorrow on.”\n\n\n I’m very happy to hear that everything is coming along nicely. On the other hand, though, I suddenly feel like I’ve forgotten something important.\n\n\n “Does something seem to be the matter, Sister Ma?ne?” asks Fran.\n\n\n “…I think that there may be something that I am forgetting about. Fran, might you have any ideas?”\n\n\n “Something… you’re forgetting about?”\n\n\n “Yes, something about the temple. I can’t quite put my finger on it…”\n\n\n As Benno eats his dessert, and Fran and I contemplate, a huge crash sounds from downstairs as the front door is flung violently open.\n\n\n “Everything is all your fault!!”\n\n\n Ah! I remember. I forgot about Delia."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Seriously! Thanks to you, I’ve been kicked out of the temple master’s rooms! Why would you do that?!”\n\n\n Delia, burning with rage, storms up the stairs. I don’t know if she ran to get here or what, but her dark crimson hair is in disarray, and her breath comes in ragged pants as she comes to a stop in front of me. These past few days have been so massively busy with getting the kitchen in order that it feels like it’s been a very long time since I last saw her.\n\n\n “It’s all your fault! You went and got yourself a room, but I didn’t say anything about it, so the Reverend thinks I’m incompetent! Ugh, seriously!”\n\n\n All I wanted a room for was just to have a place to get changed. I didn’t just take it by myself; the head priest properly gave it to me. I had no idea where Delia had gone off to, and had no way to contact her. I fail to see how the temple master’s impression of Delia’s incompetence is even remotely my fault.\n\n\n “And what would you like me to do about this?” I ask.\n\n\n “Let me stay here, of course. I’m your attendant, so it’s only right, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “Mind your place!” thunders Benno.\n\n\n Before I even have time to react, he slams his fist down onto Delia’s head. Delia clutches her head, looking around as if she has no idea what’s going on.\n\n\n “Delia,” I chide, “that’s not the kind of behavior you should be displaying in front of my guest. It’s only natural that you should be scolded, is it not?”\n\n\n “W… why would I need you to tell me that?!”\n\n\n Benno’s eyes narrow. “Still don’t get it, huh?”\n\n\n Delia instantly shuts her mouth tight. Gil flinches, too, perhaps remembering his earlier beating at Lutz’s hands.\n\n\n “Ma?ne,” says Benno, “You don’t have any use for someone who doesn’t get the work she’s assigned done to satisfaction. Keeping someone who doesn’t have any motivation on the payroll is a waste of your money. Get rid of her.”\n\n\n The words that Benno disdainfully spits mirror what Lutz had told Gil. It’s obvious to see what kind of effect Benno’s had on him.\n\n\n “Ah, Fran,” I say. “I am not entirely certain of the details behind Delia’s assignment to me, but if she is saying that she was kicked out of the temple master’s rooms, does that mean he has cut ties with her?”\n\n\n My words seem to strike a mark. Delia’s eyes fill with tears as she glares at me, almost on the verge of crying.\n\n\n “…He hasn’t cut me out yet,” she says, her voice cracking.\n\n\n Fran speaks up. “I would not say that the Reverend has cut ties with her, but…”\n\n\n “Exactly!” says Delia, latching onto his words. “There’s no way he could get rid of a cute little girl like me, is there?”\n\n\n Delia’s face shines with renewed hope. Fran’s expression, however, does not change. He continues to speak, laying out the harsh reality.\n\n\n “Delia did not know that you were given rooms,” he explains to me, “and without knowledge of those rooms’ whereabouts could not work for you. As such, she was incapable of delivering necessary information about your activities to him. I do not find it at all mysterious as to why she would bear his displeasure.”\n\n\n “…Huh?”\n\n\n Delia’s eyes open wide with disbelief, but Fran pays her no attention, looking supremely disinterested as he continues talking. It seems that Fran, an earnest and hardworking person, takes great offense to Delia, who not only fails to do her duty as my attendant, but also actively sought to make trouble for me. His expression may be placid, but I can feel the anger burning beneath it.\n\n\n “The temple master assigned her to you because of the expectation that you would easily bond with a girl your age, putting her in a situation where she could gather a large amount of valuable information for him. As she has instead displayed such naked hostility to you, causing you to remain highly vigilant around her, I can only imagine how much of a disappointment she may be to him.”\n\n\n “Th… that’s…”\n\n\n Delia’s face falls. The thought occurs to me that the fact that she got kicked out of the temple master’s rooms only underscores the possibility that she’s getting cut off, but as soon as the thought enters my mind, Delia puts on a fawning smile, looking up at Fran.\n\n\n “Hey, hey, y’know, I could be a good attendant here. It’s not right for an apprentice priestess to not have any female attendants. Right?”\n\n\n Her ploy to guarantee her next lodgings did not involve asking me, her master, but instead cunningly went straight to targeting Fran, the most influential of my attendants.\n\n\n Fran, who typically doesn’t show his emotions on his face, glares at her with naked disgust. He snorts coldly.\n\n\n “As Sister Ma?ne does not live here, she largely does not require any assistance with her everyday necessities. Despite the fact that you were not here over these past few days, we encountered no problems at all. I would consider that to be proof of how little additional assistance she needs. Furthermore, even if she were to somehow require such assistance, it is entirely possible for her to select a new attendant from the orphanage.”\n\n\n I’d thought that since Delia was assigned to me by the head priest I wouldn’t be able to get rid of her, but it seems like I might be able to add someone new to my staff. “What an excellent idea,” I say, approvingly, to Fran, which causes Delia to bite her lip, tears starting to drip from her eyes.\n\n\n “…You’re kicking me out?”\n\n\n When I look at those excessively pretty tears, I can instantly tell that Delia lives solely for the purpose of making men fall for her. Now that she’s in a disadvantageous position, she clings sweetly to Fran, showing us her tears. Everything down to the angle at which she’s looking up at us is perfect. Even though she’s still very young, she knows exactly what kind of weapons women can bring to bear. It’s really amazing to see what someone can do when they’re fully aware of how cute they are. If I were to have tried to use that kind of technique back in my Urano days, they probably would have said “ugh, creepy,” and kicked me away.\n\n\n Since until now she’s been nothing but extremely hostile to me, her suddenly putting on this pitiable air and begging me for help really puts me on the spot. To be honest, I’m really irritated at her right now, but actually kicking out a crying little girl seems too brutish. So, this oppressive atmosphere lingers, leaving me keenly aware of how bad I am at not being able to say anything.\n\n\n “Don’t worry about kicking her out or whatever. She wasn’t ever one of us in the first place.”\n\n\n The one to break the moody atmosphere that Delia had so deliberately crafted to engender sympathy in her plight is Gil, who smashes it apart with a grand smile.\n\n\n “Wh… w, wha?!”\n\n\n “Someone who doesn’t actually work here doesn’t get a room, and of course they can’t eat here, either. ‘He who does not work, neither shall he eat!’ Isn’t that right, Sister Ma?ne?”\n\n\n Gil puffs out his chest, proud at remembering the phrase.1 I’m not sure if he just failed to read the room or if he did and just didn’t care, but either way he did a good job. I’d better make sure to praise him lots later. Next to me, Benno mutters, “You’re not strong enough to do any work either. You don’t get to say that.” but I ignore him. Pointedly.\n\n\n “Since Gil works hard at his job,” I say, “he has a room, and he can eat until his belly is full. I have nothing to offer a girl who does not do her work.”\n\n\n “Alright, then. So then I just need to work, then?”\n\n\n As she says this, she smoothly slides into Benno’s lap, smiling sweetly as she draws herself close to him. I blink, dumbfounded, having no idea what in the world is happening right now. Benno looks supremely disgusted, his face twitching as he waves his hands.\n\n\n “Sorry, but I’m not interested in kids like you. Please get down.”\n\n\n “See?” she says to me, giving me a triumphant grin as she comes down from Benno’s lap. “You don’t have any gray-robed priestesses around, so you’re upsetting your guests.”\n\n\n Seeing first-hand what the gray-robed priestesses that serve as the temple master’s attendants are supposed to do makes me want to clutch my head in horror. Benno, probably feeling the same way, rubs at his temples, scowling at Delia disagreeably.\n\n\n “I don’t need any flower to begin with. Please don’t lump me in with the nobles who long for the flowers kept here.”\n\n\n “Huh? That’s, you mean…”\n\n\n It seems that, until now, Delia’s job has been to take care of the daily necessities of the attendants who’ve already become the temple master’s mistresses while polishing her beauty and her education for the sake of being part of the next generation of mistresses. It also looks like she’s supposed to lavish the temple master’s visitors with sweet smiles.\n\n\n “I have no need for such attendants,” I say, matter-of-factly.\n\n\n “I… I can clean and do laundry, too. I helped get the Reverend’s clothes ready for him, and I can definitely keep this room clean, too.”\n\n\n She grabs my sleeve tightly in her fist. I think that, faced with the fact that none of the things she’s ever done so far apply here at all, her own sense of values might be shaking. She isn’t smiling flirtatiously. Her eyes aren’t full of tears. Her face is frozen in a look of bewilderment as she starts looking desperately around the room. However, there’s nobody in this room who has any desire to save cute little Dalia from her plight.\n\n\n It’s probably true that Delia is in real trouble now that she’s been kicked out of the temple master’s rooms, I think. I look up at Fran, hoping for some assistance in figuring out what to do.\n\n\n “Perhaps a night spent in the reflection room would be sufficient?” he says. “She has, in fact, showed great disrespect to you.”\n\n\n “I’ll reflect on my actions! I’m going to do everything just right from now on. So… please don’t kick me out. Please don’t say you don’t need me!”\n\n\n Delia looks desperately up at me as she pleads, whimpering like she can barely contain herself from bursting into tears. Her shockingly serious plea makes my eyes widen, and both Fran and Gil are making pained faces, as if they themselves had been told that they weren’t needed.\n\n\n Gil was a problem child who spent nearly every day in the reflection room, and when Fran was sent away from the head priest’s side, he was left feeling wounded, like he was no longer necessary. The two of them are probably remembering how they felt back then.\n\n\n “Fran,” I say. “If Delia performs her duties in earnest, then I believe everything shall be fine.”\n\n\n “As you wish, Sister.”\n\n\n After giving the tiniest sigh of relief, Fran turns to Delia, his expression growing stern.\n\n\n “If you wish to work here, then first, correct your manner of speech. I have no use for an attendant who does not think of Sister Ma?ne as her master.”\n\n\n “Understood,” she replies.\n\n\n And so, with her declaration that she will start working, we wrap up this predicament without me having to banish a crying little girl from my room. Composing myself, I turn to ask her a question.\n\n\n “Now then, what kinds of work can you do?”\n\n\n “I can put this room in order as befitting a blue-robed priestess such as yourself. Starting with this!”\n\n\n She points dramatically at a room that I’d assumed was the storage room for the second floor. It seems that in actuality it’s supposed to be a bathroom, with a tub and a toilet. There’s nothing in there now, so I hadn’t realized it at all.\n\n\n “You’ve had plenty of time over the last few days; why is it that you haven’t acquired any equipment? Leaving the bathtub aside, what have you been doing when you need to use the restroom?”\n\n\n “Huh? There’s one downstairs, so I use those, and then I clean up after myself…”\n\n\n “What?! I don’t believe it! Seriously! You go to the first floor? You use the attendants’ toilet? And worse, you say that you use the mens’ restroom? Have you no shame!”\n\n\n Even though she’s being a bit more polite in speech, I feel like her attitude hasn’t changed all that much. Is it just my imagination?\n\n\n Delia goes through the room, identifying item after item that this room is missing. Not only do I not have a bathtub and a toilet, but I’m also missing a dresser as well as a writing desk. Apparently, using the same round table in the center of the room for both eating and writing makes me a failure of a blue-robed priestess. Even though I try to tell her that I’m not planning on taking any baths here, she insists that I someday might, and that I should make sure for my own sake that I can do so on the second floor.\n\n\n “Can you help me get these, Mister Benno?” I ask.\n\n\n “Leave it to me. …If you were missing all of this, then it looks like having an attendant that knows about how priestesses live might actually be necessary. Besides, if you keep making her mad like that, maybe you’ll be able to become a bit more noble yourself, huh?”\n\n\n “Ngh…”\n\n\n Next, Delia starts carrying water up to fill the jug on the second floor. It seems that if nobody brings any water upstairs, then washing one’s face and hands is difficult, as is cleaning up after using the restroom. I’d been thinking she was the frail princess type, but since she’s apparently been working zealously to make sure she could be a mistress, she’s got more than enough arm strength, stamina, and sheer grit to carry water.\n\n\n “Nobody even bothered getting any water to the second floor. Seriously!”\n\n\n Delia keeps up a bitter monologue as she works, complaining about everything around her. After Fran makes sure that she’s actually started working, he returns to the kitchens, and Gil starts working on cleaning the first floor. I, meanwhile, reach for the dessert that’s been sitting untouched on the table. As I chew, I strike up a conversation with Benno.\n\n\n “Come to think of it, the other day, the head priest ordered me to have a set of ceremonial robes made, but what’s special about ceremonial robes?”\n\n\n “They’re meant to catch the attention of people outside the temple. Essentially, you should think of them as your nicest clothes. So, if we were to just think about appearances, they are totally different from what you might usually wind up wearing. The embroidery on the hems has your family crest sewn into it, and…”\n\n\n He freezes halfway through his sentence, looking straight at me in shock.\n\n\n “Ma?ne. When’s the ceremony you need this for? I have no idea how long it’s going to take to make something suitable for noble ceremonies.”\n\n\n From the way the politeness immediately drops from his tone, I can tell just how hurried he is. There are, of course, no sewing machines here, so there’s no way you can just throw together a garment. It seems they take a lot of time to make.\n\n\n “He said that since I’m an apprentice I don’t need to go to a lot of them, but I don’t know when or what kind of ceremonies they’re going to be. Fran would probably know, right?” I turn to the stairwell. “Hey, Frmmph?!”\n\n\n As soon as I start calling out for Fran, Benno covers my mouth, pointing sternly at the bell. Ah, that’s right. You use a bell to call people. I ring the bell, and moments later Fran comes upstairs.\n\n\n “How may I be of service, Sister?”\n\n\n “I was recently informed by the head priest that I must have ceremonial robes tailor-made for me, yet I do not know when those ceremonies may take place. Would you happen to know, perhaps?”\n\n\n “If the order of knights requests for one this fall, then I believe that would be the closest one to today.”\n\n\n “Fall, huh…” says Benno. “Making something from scratch by then is going to be rough…”\n\n\n If we’re making fancy clothes befitting a noble, then it’s obvious that everything must be carefully considered, starting from the thread used. Fran, seeing Benno’s scowl, glances over at the wooden box along the far wall.\n\n\n “Master Benno,” he says, “might I suggest that you use the fabric that you gave Sister Ma?ne to make her ceremonial robes? It is of very excellent quality, so once dyed I believe it would be more than suitable for the purpose.”\n\n\n “…She doesn’t have a family crest. What do we do about that?”\n\n\n “Does her workshop have a something similar to a crest?”\n\n\n “I’ll make one right now!” I say.\n\n\n As Benno takes my measurements, discussing the requirements for the design of my ceremonial robes, I gleefully start thinking up ideas for my workshop’s crest. My first idea is a book, a pen, and ink, but Fran and Benno both reject it, saying that it’s too plain, and help me correct it. Ultimately, we wind up with a design incorporating the trees used in making paper and the flowers from the hairpins, a crest designed to leave a strong impression. Fran, nodding in satisfaction, says that it is an enormous success at conveying the gorgeousness befitting a woman, and so it’s decided.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, the cooks say that they have finished preparing our dinner for today.”\n\n\n “Is that so? Well then, could you please ensure that they have properly tidied up the kitchen once they are finished, perhaps?”\n\n\n At my direction, Fran checks over the kitchen and confirms the plans for tomorrow with the cooks before seeing them off.\n\n\n “I shall head home for today,” I say. “You two, please get changed.”\n\n\n Gil and Fran each hurry off to their individual rooms. Since Lutz and Benno have business coming up soon that they need to go to another part of town for, right now it’s a good time for my attendants to practice dropping me off at home.\n\n\n I start taking off my blue robes, getting myself ready to go home. When I start untying the sash, though, Delia stands in front of me in an imposing stance, her face twisted in anger.\n\n\n “What might you be doing?” she says.\n\n\n “Getting changed, as you can see?”\n\n\n Ah, I remember, I’m not supposed to get changed by myself. I let go of my sash and raise my arms, ready for Delia to help me to get changed. As I wait, though, her eyes only narrow more.\n\n\n “In front of a gentleman?!” she yells, glancing over at Benno, who’s still seated at the table. “How immodest!”\n\n\n I’m already wearing clothes underneath this, so I didn’t think that this would be anything to get so angry about.\n\n\n I lean back away from her. “I’m… I’m sorry? But, I’m just taking off the robes…”\n\n\n “Taking off your own clothing before a gentleman is something you only do when you want to tempt them! Letting others see you only lessens your worth as a woman. If you don’t know things like that, you’re going to be in major trouble in the future. Seriously!”\n\n\n “Is… is that so…”\n\n\n What do I do now? I think she might be angry about the wrong thing, here, but she’s being so serious that I don’t think I can actually point it out.\n\n\n “Master Benno,” says Delia, “please wait in the hall. Although she may still be very young, please refrain from watching a girl change.”\n\n\n “Sure, I’ll do that.”\n\n\n Benno, trying hard to suppress a laugh, makes his way downstairs. After verifying that he has made it all the way to the first floor, Delia unties my sash, then takes off my robe. As expected of someone who says they’ve been taking after the daily needs of the other gray-robed priestesses, she quickly folds up the robes and puts them away, then fixes my hairpin, which had come slightly loose.\n\n\n When she pokes her head downstairs, Fran calls up to her that they’ve finished getting ready to leave. At the same time, as she looks downstairs, her face suddenly freezes.\n\n\n “What… are you wearing…?”\n\n\n “A reward from Sister Ma?ne,” says Gil. Even just from the sound of his boastful voice, I can imagine just how puffed out his chest must be.\n\n\n “That’s mean! That’s not equal!”\n\n\n “This is a reward for doing work,” he says. “People who don’t do work don’t get given anything, you know.”\n\n\n “What work do you do?”\n\n\n “Cleaning,” he replies. “I worked really hard all by myself to clean this place out, so this is my reward. Heh heh, it’s nice, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “I’m not actually jealous or anything!”\n\n\n Delia cuts off the exchange with that sharp remark, tears in her eyes, looking like she’s nothing but jealous and regretful. She glares at me, pointing downstairs.\n\n\n “Everyone’s waiting for you down there. Shouldn’t you be going?”\n\n\n “I already have something ready for you, though…”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n Delia’s eyes fly open wide enough that I think her eyeballs might fall out.\n\n\n “You don’t want it?”\n\n\n “I didn’t say a single word of the sort.”\n\n\n I pull the last remaining bundle of cloth from inside the closet and hand it to Delia. She hesitantly reaches out, as if to touch it, then glances up at me.\n\n\n “…I can really have this?”\n\n\n “You’re going to work hard at your job from now on, aren’t you?”\n\n\n “I have no idea what you might do wrong if I’m not around, so I guess I have no choice, do I?”\n\n\n Delia huffs, looking away, her face bright red. She roughly grabs the bundle from me and, clutching it to her chest, runs off to the attendant’s room.\n\n\n “Hey, are you done yet?” calls Gil impatiently from downstairs.\n\n\n “Delia’s getting changed right now, so please wait a little longer,” I reply.\n\n\n I look over at the door to Delia’s room. She’s taking far longer than I would have thought for just getting changed. It’s been a while, and she hasn’t come out.\n\n\n “Delia, are you still changing?”\n\n\n I crack open the door and see Delia, already done changing, humming something to herself with a huge smile on her face as she twirls around. The instant our eyes meet, she stops, clutching her skirt and trembling visibly. Her entire face, up to her ears, turns bright red, and she glares fiercely at me.\n\n\n “D… don’t just open my door like that! Seriously!”\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. “He who does not work, neither shall he eat” is an aphorism originally from the New Testament. From context, he presumably learned this from Ma?ne, but not on-screen. (Otherwise, I have no idea why he would be quoting the New Testament.)"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n It has been a few days since Delia started working as an attendant. Since it was decided that I have to take days off, I stayed home on the day of earth, which Tuuli and my mother have off as well, but apart from that I’ve been going to the temple every single day. Since I’ve had to spend so much time on tasks like taking receipt of the things I ordered from Benno and writing up new recipes on wooden boards to teach to the cooks, I’ve been trying to get even just a little more reading time back into my life.\n\n\n During these past few days, my attendants have sorted out each of their assigned duties amongst themselves. Delia is in charge of the bathtubs, the toilets, and laundering my expensive clothing, as well as looking after my daily needs and cleaning the second floor. It also seems like Fran is teaching her how to prepare tea, as she’s started helping with that as well.\n\n\n Gil primarily handles cleaning the first floor and sweeping the grounds outside, as well as keeping an eye on the cooks as they work. He’s also currently in the middle of having proper speech and etiquette drilled into his skull by Fran. When I’d mentioned in a conversation that Lutz had spent last winter learning how to read and do math, Gil got fired up and declared that he’s going to do that too, but according to Fran there’s a huge mountain of things that he needs to learn before he can start on anything else.\n\n\n Speaking of Fran, not only does he spend time checking the other attendants’ work, but he does everything else that needs doing as well. On top of his regular duties, he’s in charge of reading the recipes to the cooks as well as taking regular inventory to make sure that they aren’t misappropriating any of the ingredients or trying to sneak out any of the finished product.\n\n\n In the morning, he accompanies me to the head priest’s chambers as I work on the paperwork. After delivering the leftovers from lunch to the orphanage, he starts the afternoon by explaining the menu to the cooks and verifying that they have the right ingredients, then accompanies me to the library room. He monitors my condition, is there to receive Benno when we have advance notice of his arrival, educates the two apprentices, and teaches me anything I need to know about the nobility, which is everything. Right now, everything is left to Fran.\n\n\n I’ve been concerned about how he might be overworked, but when I asked if perhaps his workload was too intense, he replied that since he is never summoned unexpectedly at night, he finds it quite pleasant. He is just too amazing. As my gratitude to him, my trust in him, and his salary skyrocket, I’m becoming more and more thankful to the head priest for having backed me up by assigning me such an excellent attendant. I wouldn’t have gotten this far without him.\n\n\n Today is, strictly speaking, my day off, but I’ve come to the temple anyway. I had a marble bathtub, which I was told was in vogue with the nobility these days, installed in the second-floor room that I had thought was for storage, so I need to go pay for it.\n\n\n Honestly, carrying enough water for a bath seems tremendously difficult, and I already bathe myself at home with Tuuli, so I don’t think there’s any need for me to actually have a bathtub. However, when I’d asked if just a washbasin would be good enough, Delia got mad. “Ugh, what are you saying?!” she had said. “As an attendant to the temple master, I need to be taking far more baths to remain decent!”\n\n\n Delia wanted to use the tub as soon as it arrived, so when it did I told her she could go right in, but, of course, she got mad again. “As if I could use it before my master has even touched it! Ugh!” It seems that baths for blue-robed priestesses are able to use both water and firewood, but gray-robed priestesses are only allowed to use water.\n\n\n “Now then, perhaps you could ready the bath for me?” I ask.\n\n\n She has to carry hot water all the way up from the kitchen, so I thought it would be an onerous task, but Delia, who is almost always prickling with anger, bounces happily up the stairs as she does so. I decide that if she’s enjoying herself I might as well leave her alone.\n\n\n Delia washes my hair with rinsham, helps me get dressed, dries my hair, and, after absentmindedly making sure that my hair looks good, declares that she’ll be making use of the remaining bathwater and jumps in. I imagine that she’s so enthusiastic about this because of her own desire for self-improvement.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne,” says Fran, having brought me something to drink while Delia is in the bath, “please do not place too much confidence in Delia. She is still connected to the Reverend.”\n\n\n He scowls in discomfort as he delivers his warning. When I see how serious his face is, I can’t help but chuckle a little.\n\n\n “I know,” I reply. “She just described herself as ‘an attendant to the temple master’ a few minutes ago, after all.”\n\n\n It seems like Delia is still firmly convinced that nobody could get rid of someone as cute as her. However, it also seems like she’s not able to return to the temple master’s side and has made me the foundation of her daily life instead. I’m fairly sure that she’s doing this not just because she can use this to get a lot of information about me, but also because the work itself is easy and the pay is good.\n\n\n From what she’s said, the temple master keeps two gray-robed priests and three gray-robed priestesses in his chambers. He also has three apprentice attendants, including Delia. Those three apprentices are required to take care of six people’s daily necessities. Here, however, the only person that really needs taking care of is me. On top of that, compared to other blue-robed members of the clergy, I really don’t have a whole lot that needs taking care of. On top of that, Fran, who distrusts her, isn’t making use of her like he might with a different apprentice, so he is giving her a lot less work than what might otherwise be expected.\n\n\n So, it seems like Delia is still fixated on the idea of becoming the temple master’s mistress and is thus keen on particular kinds of self-improvement. As an attendant, she isn’t looking to be useful to someone, she’s looking for someone she can use. Her particular goals aside, though, she is very hardworking in pursuit of them.\n\n\n “Even if Delia still passes everything along to the temple master, as long as she still works hard at her job, I do not particularly mind either way. We just need to be careful about what information we’re willing to let her have. …I am not entirely certain as to what information we must keep concealed from her, however.”\n\n\n He sighs. “You’re quite clearly audible right now,” he says.\n\n\n He tells me that the most important things to keep from her is anything about my family or about Lutz. Those are my weakest points, he says.\n\n\n Delia returns from her bath, and we have lunch. Today’s lunch is fluffy bread rolls, a consommé, bacon, and vegetable soup, and baked chicken with herbs. Gil and Delia take turns waiting on the table, and those who aren’t serving the table eat at about the same time I am. Fran isn’t serving the table because he’ll be going to bring the leftovers to the orphanage as the blessings of the gods, as after lunch he’ll be accompanying me to the library.\n\n\n “Then, Sister Ma?ne, I shall deliver the blessings of the gods to the orphanage,” he says.\n\n\n “Please do,” I reply.\n\n\n Outside, a wagon has already been loaded with the leftover soup, bread, and chicken, which are still warm. Since the wagon is quite heavy, Gil and Delia don’t yet have the strength to push it, so the task is left to Fran.\n\n\n “Oh? Did Fran leave already?”\n\n\n Shortly after Fran takes off, Gil exits the kitchen carrying a basket with a few more rolls in them. When he looks out the front door and sees that the wagon has already been taken away, he looks down at the basket he’s carrying.\n\n\n “What’s wrong, Gil?” I ask.\n\n\n “Delia was all, like, 'As if you could eat all of that! Ugh!’ so I thought that if I hurried I might be able to make it before the cart left. I’d been thinking that it would be a good idea to save a little so that we could have some left when it’s time for dinner, but it sounds like the cooks are going to be baking some different bread this afternoon, so…”\n\n\n “The gods’ blessings are lacking right now, are they not? Perhaps it would be best for you to bring those there yourself?”\n\n\n “Sure, I’ll do that!”\n\n\n Gil smiles confidently, hoisting up the basket in his arms. There’s only four rolls in there, but I’m sure that the orphans will be happy to get more food.\n\n\n “Hey, Gil,” I say, “might I perhaps come along with you? I’ve never seen the orphanage myself.”\n\n\n “I’ll show you around! I actually know a shortcut. Here, this way!”\n\n\n With Gil leading the way, we head towards the orphanage.\n\n\n Even though the entrance to my rooms is different from the orphanage’s entrances, the orphanage is still fairly close by, so it wouldn’t be odd for me to see younger children around. Strangely, though, I never have. I’ve seen children around Gil and Delia’s age, who’ve already been baptized, doing things like sweeping the corridors and the worship halls, doing laundry by the water well, and tending to livestock in their pens, but I’ve never actually seen any children who haven’t been baptized yet.\n\n\n “Alright,” says Gil, “so once we leave, then we take the walkway that goes around the building there. The wagon can’t go on any stairs, you know? So this way is way shorter. We’re probably gonna even beat Fran there.”\n\n\n Gil, with the kind of boastfulness you only see when someone’s spoiling a huge secret, starts heading towards the temple gates. As for me, if he really does know a shortcut, I’d very much like to take it to save what little stamina I have.\n\n\n We make our way around the building, reaching the stairs in front of the hall of worship. As we descend, the radiant summer sunlight makes the white stone of the stairs even more brilliant. I really haven’t been walking around outside that much outside of the cool hours of the morning and evening, but here beneath the noonday sun I can feel the true heat of summer.\n\n\n “The orphanage’s cafeteria is in the girls’ dormitory. The girls’ dormitory has all of the kids that haven’t been baptized yet and also any gray-robed priestesses that aren’t anyone’s attendants. When boys are baptized, they go to the boys’ dormitory. So since the gods’ blessings are given out equally to everyone, it’s way easier to have the boys come to the girls’ dormitory from wherever they’re working instead of making the girls bring the little kids with them to the boys’, right?”\n\n\n “Huh…” I say, thoughtfully.\n\n\n I listen to Gil talk about the orphanage as we make our way down the stairs and head towards the girls’ dormitory. Near the stairway, there’s a hidden back door to the orphanage. It looks like it’s barred from the outside, like nobody’s particularly worried about any intruders breaking in but are instead trying to make sure that nobody can get out this way.\n\n\n “Basically nobody but me knows that this actually opens. From the other side, it just looks like the rest of the wall, and you can’t open it from that side either.”\n\n\n “How do you know about it, then?”\n\n\n “Once, when I was really little, I saw it open in the middle of the night. Someone was beckoning from outside, and a gray-robed priestess ran out to meet them. I wanted to go out too, but the door closed right away. Back then, I really wanted to be able to go outside, so I kinda thought that maybe someone had come to get me out of there.”\n\n\n Gil, a nostalgic look in his eyes, sets the basket down at his feet and undoes the bolt. The door doesn’t seem to want to move, as if it’s rusted, so he throws his entire weight into pulling it open.\n\n\n As soon as the door cracks open, a gust of hot, foul air rolls out, and I instinctively clap my hands over my nose. Gil, making the same face, pinches his nose shut. Even though I’m used to the stink of the city, this stench is more than I can handle.\n\n\n The door swings wide and I can clearly see what lies beyond. A number of completely naked children lie on filthy piles of straw that stink of stale sh*t and piss, staring blankly at the ceiling with lifeless eyes. The room appears to be completely closed in, so even though the noonday sun is shining brightly outside the interior of the room is dark and gloomy.\n\n\n “…Blessings of the gods?”\n\n\n Perhaps drawn by the smell of the bread, a small, skeletal child, her skin smeared with something black starts crawling towards us, a desperate gleam in her eyes as she calls out to us in a raspy voice.\n\n\n I’ve only ever seen anything like this in magazines or on TV, in pictures of emaciated children fleeing Africa. As I watch this child creep towards me along the ground, the first thing that crosses my mind isn’t pity, but fear. I freeze on the spot, unable to say a word, teeth clattering in terror.\n\n\n “N… no…” I whimper.\n\n\n Gil snaps back to his senses when he hears me, frantically shutting the door and slamming the bolt closed. There’s pounding on the other side of the door, like something’s trying to break out, but there’s no force behind the blows. There’s no way the door is going to be broken down and let whatever is inside come pouring out.\n\n\n As soon as relief from having fled from my fear washes over me, images of the unthinkable scene I saw inside that orphanage crowd their way into my brain. My mind goes blank and my consciousness winks out as I faint on the spot.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n When I wake up, I’m in my own room. I move my hand experimentally, feeling that I’m lying on something hard, and realize that I’m not laying on a cotton-stuffed mattress like a noble would use, nor a straw-stuffed mattress like I have at home, but the plain, unadorned boards of the bed that I’d never bothered to do anything with. I turn my head, looking around, and see Gil in a chair at my bedside, sitting in a fetal position, making himself as small as he can.\n\n\n “…Gil?” I say.\n\n\n “You’re awake? …Oh man. I’m so sorry. I…”\n\n\n He looks like he might be about to cry as he starts talking, but before he can get another word out, Delia’s voice rings out from behind him.\n\n\n “Ugh, seriously! You took Sister Ma?ne to the girls’ dormitory and of all things you took her to the back door?! You complete idiot!”\n\n\n “As if I did that on purpose! Did you know about what was in there?!”\n\n\n As soon as the words “what was in there” leave his mouth, images of what I saw in the orphanage flash through my head. The room, completely shut off from the outside world. The straw, soaked in human filth. The children, entirely skin and bones and completely naked. That is no environment to raise children. Even animal pens have better ventilation than that.\n\n\n As I remember, my whole body breaks out in goosebumps, and something sour starts to surge up from my stomach. I bolt upright, swallowing hard, forcing it back down. Fran, seeing me suddenly sit up and clap my hand desperately over my mouth, brushes the helpless Gil aside as he approaches.\n\n\n “I am deeply, unbearably sorry, Sister Ma?ne. I am truly regretful that you were shown such a disgraceful sight. Please, forget what you saw.”\n\n\n The way Fran describes the orphanage as a “disgraceful sight” and tells me to forget all about it makes me deeply uncomfortable.\n\n\n I look over at Gil. “That was the orphanage?” I say. “That wasn’t like you described…”\n\n\n “After my baptism, I moved to the boys’ dormitory, so I don’t know anything about what the girls’ dormitory is like right now, except for the cafeteria… The place you saw is for the kids that haven’t been baptized yet, but it wasn’t like that when I was there.”\n\n\n He hangs his head shamefully, mumbling out his answer. Delia glares at him, snorts, then starts to talk.\n\n\n “It’s because there aren’t as many blue-robed priests around, so there aren’t as many grey-robed priestesses left either. There isn’t anyone left to take care of the children, so the littlest ones die off fairly quickly. If they can make it to their baptismal ceremony, then they can live on the first floor, so they’re just waiting patiently for that day to come. …That’s how it was a year ago, when I left, so right now it’s probably even worse. I don’t want to think about it.”\n\n\n She looks down at the ground, shivering.\n\n\n Gil is ten years old, so it seems like when he had his baptismal ceremony three years ago, things were much better than they are now. Delia has only just turned eight, and it sounds like around the time of her ceremony things were already horrible. Based on the grim information she reveals, it seems like since at least a year and a half ago there were fewer and fewer girls living in the dormitory, to the point where the orphans were almost completely neglected, only having food brought to them twice a day.\n\n\n “On the day of my baptismal ceremony, a gray-robed priestess came to get me. She said that I was too unsightly and dirty to be shown to the blue-robed priests. She scrubbed me until I was raw, and when she was done, she said that I was cute, and that I’d be beautiful when I grew up. Right after the ceremony, she took me to the temple master. There were three other girls who were brought with me. I got to become an apprentice attendant, but the other girls weren’t chosen, so they went back to the orphanage.”\n\n\n Now that I understand why she’s so fixated on her looks and so strongly against the idea of returning to the orphanage, I feel even more depressed.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne,” says Gil, “please, help those kids. I’m begging you.”\n\n\n “Be silent, Gil,” says Fran, sternly. “Sister, you must not get involved.”\n\n\n Even just remembering the image of what I saw makes me feel terrible, so I don’t actually want to have anything to do with it, but I’m surprised that Fran, who grew up in the orphanage, would tell me not to get involved.\n\n\n “What?! Why?!” objects Gil, saying just what I was thinking.\n\n\n “It’s too dangerous,” says Fran, plainly. “Sister Ma?ne has shown a tendency to be particularly protective of things she finds important to her, such as when she turned her magic against the temple master in order to defend her family. If she were to develop deep ties to the orphanage and it were to become something important to her as well, then there is a strong possibility that she may stand in opposition to the blue-robed clergy in order to protect the orphans. It is my belief that reducing the number of situations where she may unconsciously release her mana, even if just by a small number, is a good thing.”\n\n\n Gil has begged me to help, and Fran objected to the idea. For some reason, I turn to Delia, looking for her opinion.\n\n\n “…If you can help them, then I think you should. But I don’t want to have anything to do with it. I don’t want to have to remember.”\n\n\n She looks pointedly away, her expression hard.\n\n\n Gil, hearing no sympathy for his desire to help the orphans, grimaces as if he’s been deeply wounded. Clenching his teeth, he looks at me with trembling eyes, then slowly lowers himself down on one knee before me. He crosses both hands before his chest, casting his eyes down.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, I’m begging you, please, help those kids.”\n\n\n His heartfelt plea makes my jaw tighten. There is some part of me that thinks that if I can do anything to help them, I should. If someone were to say that they wanted to do something concrete, and that thing were to be something that was reasonable for me to do, then I think I could help with that.\n\n\n However, if they were to tell me to keep doing it forever, or if they tell me to do something without giving me any suggestions or advice, then I’d be at a loss for what to do.\n\n\n In my Urano days, I did actually do some work helping with a fundraiser, but that kind of volunteer work was a compulsory part of my education. Outside of that, I had no interest in anything that didn’t involve reading books. And now, as Ma?ne, I’m weak and frail. People are always looking out for me and helping me with my daily life. If there’s something that I know that might be helpful, I could suggest it, but fundamentally everything that involves actual action has to be done by someone else. I can’t think of anything that I can do myself.\n\n\n “Right now,” says Gil, “I’m really enjoying my work because you keep telling me I’m doing a good job, and I’m happy that if I work really hard, my wages go up. The food here’s delicious, and I can eat as much as I want, and I have my own room that’s big enough for me to stretch out when I sleep. But, those kids, they…”\n\n\n “I’m sorry, Gil,” I say. “There’s nothing much that I can do. I’m a blue-robed priestess that isn’t actually a noble, so I can’t just ignore what Fran is saying, either.”\n\n\n Gil looks up at me, clearly hurt.\n\n\n All I am is an ordinary commoner who wanted to trade my mana and money for the right to read more books. I don’t know anything about anything right now, so as I am, I can’t just freely promise that I’ll take care of the orphans, and I really can’t take any responsibility to look after them forever.\n\n\n “But,” I continue, “I will at least try to ask the head priest about this. Since there’s a surplus of gray-robed priests, then perhaps he could assign some of them to take care of the orphans, or perhaps we could make a little more room in the budget for them, or…” I trail off. “I’ll ask him if there might be anything that can be done to improve the situation at the orphanage.”\n\n\n “Thank you,” he replies.\n\n\n The head priest is capable enough to be able to handle the entire temple’s daily affairs by himself. If I tell him about the current situation in there, then he should be able to do something about it, whether it’s allocating more funding or assigning people to look after the youngest kids. Now that I have a plan to talk with him, I take a breath to calm myself.\n\n\n Fran frowns at me, his eyebrows knitting together. “Sister Ma?ne,” he says, “there is no need to involve yourself.”\n\n\n “…I’m just going to ask the head priest about it. Might I ask you to arrange a time for me to speak with him, if possible?”\n\n\n If he refuses my request, then there’s nothing I can do. If he has a suggestion, then I could put it into action. But at the very least, what this would do is clear up my worries about whether or not I can actually do anything about this situation.\n\n\n Fran hesitates, and I ask him again, finally getting him to set a time for me to meet with the head priest.\n\n\n When the fifth bell rings, and the time arranged for my meeting comes, Fran and I head towards the head priest’s office. It seems that Fran had already told the head priest about what I wanted to ask about, because when I arrive, he looks me straight in the eyes and answers me immediately.\n\n\n “Your request is denied. There is no reason to improve the situation.”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. Content advisory: description of cruelty to children through severe privation."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Having been rejected before I could say even a single word, I’m left completely unable to comprehend what the head priest just said. I hadn’t even considered the possibility that someone who knows about the situation in the orphanage could tell me that there’s no reason to improve it.\n\n\n “What do you mean by there being no reason to improve the situation?” I ask. “There are very young kids in there on the verge of starving to death. That’s no place to raise children…”\n\n\n Thinking that perhaps he just hasn’t heard all of the details, I uneasily start to explain to him what I saw earlier today, but he just raises his hands, cutting me off.\n\n\n “With all of the working gray-robed priests and priestesses, as well as their attendants, we simply do not have the funds to spare for unbaptized orphans. Since you were raised by your parents from birth, you may not be aware of this, but the temple does not recognize unbaptized children as people. When they receive their baptisms and are registered as citizens, then they are acknowledged as people.”\n\n\n I already knew that it’s not possible to hire someone who hasn’t been baptized yet, so I’d figured that there was some sort of similar situation going on here. However, I can’t imagine being okay with how those kids are being treated just because they aren’t technically considered people.\n\n\n “…So, then, you don’t care if those children die?”\n\n\n “Yes, if that were to be the gods’ will. To be perfectly honest, it would be a great help if their numbers were to thin out.”\n\n\n I was hoping he’d say he actually cared, but he instead just clearly says that he doesn’t. As I sit there, dumbfounded, he begins to explain to me the situation with the gray-robed priests and priestesses that currently remain in the orphanage.\n\n\n “There used to be over twice as many blue robes as there are now. As for their attendants and apprentices, the math is easy to do. One blue robe has, on average, five to six attendants working for them. So, now that so many of them have been called back to noble society, do you understand how many attendants they left behind?”\n\n\n If there are ten fewer blue-robed clergy here than there were before, then that means that there’s between sixty and seventy attendants that were left here. Here in the temple, where attendants are supported as part of the blue robed priests’ donations and living expenses, that would definitely cause an administrative breakdown.\n\n\n “We were able to sell off thirty of the unnecessary priests and priestesses to the nobility to work as servants, but there are still too many here.”\n\n\n “Perhaps some of those priests could be tasked with taking care of the young children?” \n\n “If they’re being taken care of, then it’ll be problematic if their number increases again. Do you know why the temple master disposes of his gray-robed priestesses? Hm, I think you might not be able to understand what I’m trying to say.”\n\n\n What I’m trying to get across is that, even though the number of blue-robed priests and priestesses at the temple is the lowest it’s ever been right now, that number will rise again in the next few years, so it would be a problem if there simply wasn’t anyone left in the orphanages. The head priest, however, says that the gods’ blessings are already insufficient, so it’ll be an even bigger problem if the number of people in the orphanage increases any more than it already has.\n\n\n “…At the very least, even if it’s just cleaning, can’t something be done? I can easily imagine a plague ripping its way through such a filthy environment.”\n\n\n “Hmm. It’s unsightly, so it’s better to bury it all, you say? The thought isn’t without its merits, but that would not be good for our reputation.”\n\n\n “No!! That’s not at all what I meant…”\n\n\n How the hell did you come up with that idea?!\n\n\n I bite down on an angry yell. Our standpoints and sets of common knowledge are just too different. Even though we’re hearing each others’ words, we’re not actually gaining a shared understanding.\n\n\n “Father,” I say, “why does the orphanage exist? Is it not a place to raise children who don’t have any parents?”\n\n\n “That’s not entirely correct. It is a place that, at the charity of nobles, takes in children who have no one else to look after them and raises them so that they may serve the nobility.”\n\n\n Even what we think the orphanage is for is way too different. I can’t even communicate any of my emotions about how they’re pitiful or how I want to help them.\n\n\n The head priest, sighs, seeming to be similarly irritated about not being understood.\n\n\n “If you want something to be done about the dying children, then why don’t you do it? Nobody thus far has wanted to become the orphanage director. If you were to take that position, then you’d have full responsibility over the entire orphanage. Will you do it?”\n\n\n I gulp. I hadn’t expected him to ask me that. While I do want to help the orphans, I am nowhere close to ready to take on the burden of taking care of the entire orphanage. I can’t do something so terrifying.\n\n\n I clench my fists tightly in my lap. “I can’t,” I say, shaking my head.\n\n\n He nods, humming thoughtfully. Looking down at me, he continues his argument.\n\n\n “Then, considering the current ratio of blue to gray robes, the gods’ blessings are sufficient to feed about forty people in the orphanage. You, out of all the blue-robed clergy, are the most able to be free with your money. Are you capable of providing food for the remaining forty-plus people living in the orphanage?”\n\n\n “…I am not. My workshop holds most of my funds. I don’t actually have that much money I can freely use.”\n\n\n Between furnishing my rooms and paying my attendants, I’m already overspending right now. Right now, I’m at the level where I’m more-or-less okay, thanks to the money I made from selling recipes. But since the Italian restaurant isn’t even open yet, I don’t have any prospects for earning any more money. Right now, there’s no way I can take on feeding all of the orphans.\n\n\n “You can’t take responsibility and you can’t provide any funding. If you can’t do anything, then be silent. A child like you, with your half-baked sense of justice, should not run your mouth. Don’t think about silly things, just go be a good girl and read those books you love so much.”\n\n\n What he’s saying is undeniably correct. I have no rebuttal. I can’t do anything about it, so I have no right to complain. Rather than doing something half-heartedly, it would be better if I just did nothing at all.\n\n\n “…I am terribly sorry for wasting your time,” I say.\n\n\n Head hanging, I leave the head priest’s chamber.\n\n\n I asked him for help and was told no. There is nothing more I can do. I have no choice but to just bear with it. No matter how much I try to tell myself that, though, it still feels like there’s a ball of lead churning around in my stomach.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne,” says Fran, kneeling beside me, “shall I lead you to the library room? I believe that may help ease your mind.”\n\n\n There’s genuine concern in his voice, unlike the sour tone he’d used when I told him I wanted to speak with the head priest.\n\n\n “…Fran, did you know this was going to happen?”\n\n\n “It was my job to understand what the Father is thinking. As such, I judged that this conversation would only dishearten you. Please, forget about the orphanage.”\n\n\n Fran takes me by the hand, and we go to the library. As I read, I immerse myself in the book, not thinking about anything unnecessary. However, before I even realize it, the sixth bell rings, telling me that it’s time for Lutz to come pick me up. I need to leave the library and go back to my own room to change.\n\n\n On my way back to my room, I catch a glimpse of the orphanage from the hallway. In that instant, all of the images come flooding back through my mind, and my gut starts to churn.\n\n\n “Urgh…”\n\n\n The instant I start to heave, I clap my hand over my mouth, trying desperately to keep everything in. Fran hurriedly picks me up, bringing me to a cleaning bucket.\n\n\n I try not to cry as I throw up into the bucket.\n\n\n There’s no way I can forget what I saw. If I could spend every waking moment reading, then I might be able to forget about it, but I know that when I’m not reading, it’s all going to come back.\n\n\n In my Urano days, there was a huge physical distance between Japan and Africa. There wasn’t a whole lot of impact on my daily life, so donating a couple hundred yen was enough to assuage my conscience. All I ever saw was the image on the TV screen, so my reaction was only ever “oh, those poor kids”. Even if the topic came up when I was in the middle of eating dinner, I could forget about it immediately.\n\n\n Now, though, my rooms are literally connected to the orphanage. Now that I know that there’s only a single wall separating me from that awful situation, I won’t be able to rest easy at all.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, how’d it go?”\n\n\n Gil innocently runs up to me, asking me how my conversation went. His purple eyes, so dark they’re almost black, are so full of hope that they’re painful to look at.\n\n\n I avert my eyes. “I’m sorry, Gil. The head priest refused me.”\n\n\n “Wh… why?!”\n\n\n Gil stares at me in panicked disbelief. Not only can I not save the orphans from their situation, I can’t even meet Gil’s expectations. I stare down at the floor, bracing myself for whatever he’s going to say next.\n\n\n “Gil, restrain yourself,” says Fran.\n\n\n “Ugh, you idiot,” says Delia. “Didn’t I tell you that getting your hopes up was pointless?”\n\n\n Their words hold him back. He chews his lip, looking like he has something he really wants to say, but then hangs his head in silence.\n\n\n As Delia gets things ready to help me get changed, she shrugs, with a know-it-all expression on her face.\n\n\n “The one really responsible for that situation is the temple master,” she says, matter-of-factly, “who says that priestesses who are bearing child can’t do their work and are useless, so they’re always the first people he gets rid of. There’s nothing that the head priest can do about that.”\n\n\n “Delia?” I say.\n\n\n “It’s true! Priestesses whose bellies are too big or who have just given birth live over there, but whenever it’s decided that there’s too many people in there, then they’re the first to go, right? But, when guests come, you need to be able to offer them flowers, so there need to be replacements available for any priestesses whose bellies get too big, so you can’t get rid of too many of them.”\n\n\n Delia tells me that right now, the gray-robed priestesses and apprentices that are left in the orphanage who do the cleaning and laundry are all fairly young and fairly attractive. Priestesses who give birth are disposed of. The ones who aren’t pretty are sold off as servants to the nobility. All that’s left are those who are candidates to be flowers. It sounds like this is all the result of keeping around only what’s necessary for the blue-robed priests.\n\n\n Men can’t bear children, so they work for much longer. As a result, they become highly educated and thus fetch a high price when sold to the nobility as attendants. However, since the number of nobles in the city has decreased, there hasn’t been as much demand. So, right now, there are actually more priests left over than priestesses.\n\n\n “So what you’re telling me is that the children in the orphanage are the blue-robed priests’ children, then?” I ask. “Doesn’t that mean they’ll have noble blood?”\n\n\n “…About half of them, do, I think? I mean, I do,” she says, without hesitation.\n\n\n “Huh? Then, you have mana, too?”\n\n\n “The more mana you have, the harder it is to conceive a child. So, the only blue-robed priests here that are able to father children are the ones who have very little mana. I heard that fathering a child means that a priest will never be called back to noble society,” she says.\n\n\n So, now, all that’s left in the temple are blue-robed priests who don’t have any mana. This excessively self-centered style of management makes both my head and my stomach hurt.\n\n\n “The temple master”, Delia continues, “is the one who decides what goes on in the temple, so rather than try to go against him, I think it’d be better to do things he’d be happy with. Now, then! Gentlemen, please leave. Sister Ma?ne must get changed.”\n\n\n She claps her hands, driving Fran and Gil from the room, then starts quickly changing my clothes for me.\n\n\n “Ugh! Don’t make that face. You look like you’re going to die. Just forget about it, alright? Even if you worry, there’s nothing you can do about it,” she says, skillfully helping me get dressed.\n\n\n There’s no way that there’s nothing that I can do. If I invest all of Ma?ne’s Workshop’s funds, I should be able to do something.\n\n\n However, neither the temple master nor the head priest are seeking to improve the orphanage. Also, if I do invest, then once my funds dry up, then everything goes back the way it was. On top of that, I don’t have it in me to be able to take on the burden of caring for all of those peoples’ lives. I’m too gripped with fear to even be able to just invest money in the problem.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n “Lutz! Lutz!”\n\n\n “Ma?ne?!”\n\n\n I run through the temple gates, latching on tightly to Lutz. The instant I grab hold of him, all the tears I’ve been holding back burst forth, like a dam breaking. It’s probably because of the sense of relief I feel from having returned to a place where my own knowledge of how things work is actually correct.\n\n\n Lutz, by reflex, starts patting my head as he looks up at Fran, who came to see me off today.\n\n\n “Did something happen?” he says.\n\n\n “I shall explain while we walk,” replies Fran, glancing briefly at the gatekeepers.\n\n\n As we walk through streets full of people hurrying to get home, Fran explains to Lutz what had happened today.\n\n\n “All she did was ask the head priest to help the orphans. She was unable to persuade him and was forced to abandon her attempt, but it seems that her heart remains unconvinced.”\n\n\n “…Whoa, those kids are going to die? That’s real rough. But, Ma?ne, there isn’t anything you can actually do about it, right? You should ignore it. Forget about it.”\n\n\n I live a poor, but still relatively comfortable life, so that scene struck me exceptionally deeply. There’s no way I can just be convinced otherwise.\n\n\n “I think it would be great if I could just forget about it,” I say, tears streaming down my face. “I’d love to not know about it. But now that I know that something like that is happening literally on the other side of my wall, there’s no way I can just forget about it!”\n\n\n Lutz stops walking, turning to look at me directly.\n\n\n “You really hate that disaster that you saw, right? What do you want it to be instead?”\n\n\n The images flash through my mind again, and I think to myself about what I’d like to see in the orphanage instead.\n\n\n “…I want those kids to be able to eat until they’re all full, and I want them to all grow up big and strong. I want them to not have to sleep on that filthy, stinky, uncovered straw that looks like it’s getting them all sick. I want them sleeping on blankets, at least!”\n\n\n “Huh? You want them to eat until they’re full? Man, you gotta be rich to do that, right? It’s normal to just eat enough that you’ve got energy to keep moving. I don’t even get to eat until I’m full at my house, you know.”\n\n\n It sounds like I’m aiming too high. Thinking back to my own life at home, I suddenly realize that I was thinking about managing the orphanage from the standards of noble society at the temple.\n\n\n Lately, at the temple, I’ve been able to eat as much delicious food as I could possible want. Since even at home we’ve managed to increase our household earnings, I’d forgotten that it’s rare for kids in the poorer parts of the city to be able to eat their fill. Lutz, for one, is constantly hungry, and is always constantly fighting for food with his brothers at the dinner table.\n\n\n “Ah, right, they don’t actually need to be all full…”\n\n\n “And it’s weird to expect that you’d be the one bringing in all the food, right? What about what they can get for themselves? If they’re hungry, rather than just waiting around, what could they do?”\n\n\n Since the temple is a particularly peculiar institution, I hadn’t been using my own common knowledge to think of solutions, but if I set the target standard of living as an average kid from the poor parts of town, then the financial burden drops massively. Any food that can’t be bought can be foraged for in the forest and brought back.\n\n\n “Unfortunately, the orphans are not allowed to leave the temple,” says Fran, looking pained.\n\n\n The orphans are, for all practical purposes, kept locked in the orphanage. Before their baptism, it’s so that the nobility doesn’t have to see anything unsightly. After, it’s so that they don’t learn anything undesirable.\n\n\n I don’t think to comment on Fran’s view. Lutz, however, has no knowledge of how the temple works, and objects.\n\n\n “So, tell me,” he says, tilting his head, “who decided that orphans can’t leave the temple? If they’re not needed for anything, then there’s no problem for them to be going to the forest, now, is there? Like, what about you and Gil? You can leave.”\n\n\n “Fran and Gil are my attendants,” I say, “so they’re a special case.”\n\n\n Since I commute to and from the temple, escorting me to and from home is part of their job. It’s effectively the same as when other blue-robed priests bring their attendants with them to the nobles’ district. It’s not like they can just come and go freely.\n\n\n “So, how about you take all the kids that are left there and make them your attendants? If you do that, then they can all leave, right?”\n\n\n “…Huh?”\n\n\n I look up at Lutz, blinking several times at his unexpected proposal.\n\n\n “Please hold on,” says Fran. “Think of how many… Sister Ma?ne, would it not be unreasonable for you to provide the necessities of life to all of them?”\n\n\n “Well,” says Lutz, “if we’re thinking of getting them outside, then yeah we need to get all of them clothes, but since we’re just talking about clothes for going to the forest, then we can get them real cheap from some of the second-hand clothing stores we use, can’t we?”\n\n\n I start running the math in my head for buying used clothing for all of the orphans, as well as getting knives and baskets for going to the forest. Since it would be impossible, after all, for everyone to simultaneously abandon their duties in the temple to go to the forest, I could have a squad rotation instead, meaning that they’d be able to share equipment, cutting down on how much I need to buy.\n\n\n “…If it’s just cheap second-hand clothing for fifty to sixty people, plus knives and baskets for going to the forest, then it’ll be cheap,” I say. “It’ll be about thirty percent of the cost I spent on clothes for you and the other two,” I tell Fran.\n\n\n Fran’s eyes fly open in shock, and he looks down at what he’s wearing. The clothes I bought for my attendants are high class. They are nothing even remotely comparable to what I wear when I’m at home.\n\n\n “They should be able to go to the forest, forage for food, and take care of themselves. After all, the orphanage doesn’t have any money, so in other words, they’re all poor people.”\n\n\n He’s being very blunt, but he’s also very right. They shouldn’t just have to wait to be given things they need. They should be able to take care of themselves.\n\n\n I turn to Fran. “Since I’ve asked you and Gil to go to Benno’s shop a few times already, it sounds like it’s possible to send attendants out on errands?”\n\n\n “…You are correct,” he says, slowly.\n\n\n “So, if I were to ask my attendants to go to the forest to harvest, say, folin for me, then would that be possible?”\n\n\n Lutz’s eyes immediately light up.\n\n\n “A branch of Ma?ne’s Workshop in the orphanage?”\n\n\n “Yeah! If I open up a branch of Ma?ne’s Workshop in the orphanage, and they can make things in order to pay for their own food expenses, then even if I’m not there anymore, then they won’t start starving.”\n\n\n Rather, getting them in a position where they can go to the forest, gather food, and cook for themselves comes first. As Lutz and I talk about what the most efficient way to do things might be and where to start the project from, Fran suddenly interjects, looking like he has something hard to say.\n\n\n “These are all very excellent ideas,” he says. “…However. These are all extremely different from how the temple has done things historically. The head priest will also ask you if you are prepared to shoulder the responsibility for all of those people. Are you able to do so?”\n\n\n All of the blood instantly drains from my face.\n\n\n It’s exactly as he says. I’m an outsider, and a child at that. If I were to suddenly burst in, ignoring all custom, and ransack the orphanage, I can’t imagine any good would come from that. I’d be in conflict with the blue-robed priests, including the temple master and the head priest, and if I’m paying people based on their work at the workshop, then no matter how you look at it that’s not distributing everything equally among everyone.\n\n\n “Sorry, Lutz. I can’t take on that much responsibility. It’s too scary…”\n\n\n “So. Which is scarier, then? All those orphans dying without you doing anything, or taking responsibility?”\n\n\n “…”\n\n\n They’re both terrifying. If I abandon the orphanage the way that it currently is, then every single day I’m going to feel like there’s a leaden pit in my stomach. However, there’s no way that I can actually take responsibility for other peoples’ lives.\n\n\n I hold my hand to my stomach. Lutz just shrugs at me.\n\n\n “Hey, Ma?ne. Don’t think about it too hard. If you try, and it doesn’t work, it’s okay to just stop, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “Lutz, just stopping… the lives of the orphans are at stake, you know?”\n\n\n I scowl at him, but he just snorts back at me in a very Benno-like fashion.\n\n\n “Isn’t it normal for a workshop that doesn’t do any work or a shop that doesn’t have any sales to go bankrupt? But if you’re doing this in the orphanage, then even if the workshop goes under, then it’s not like the workers are suddenly out in the cold, you know?”\n\n\n “…Because they’re still living in the orphanage, and at least they’re still getting the gods’ blessings, huh.”\n\n\n “Even if the workshop doesn’t work out, nobody’s going to be out on the streets, so what exactly does it mean that you need to take responsibility for their lives? Also, since we’re talking about something Ma?ne’s Workshop is doing, you know you’ve got me here with you too, right?”\n\n\n I think there are probably a lot of different things that I’ll need to take responsibility for. If Benno were telling me to take responsibility, then he’d be telling me to take responsibility as the workshop’s head. And there’s bound to be even more cases I’m not thinking about.\n\n\n But, still. If I’m working together with Lutz, then I think we might just be alright. It’s too scary for me to do by myself, but if I have Lutz with me, who’s been by my side all this time, then I’m positive that we’ll be able to make something work.\n\n\n “Let’s do this together, Ma?ne,” he says. “You want to help them, right?”\n\n\n “Yeah!” I reply, jumping forward to take his outstretched hand.\n\n\n Fran smiles, looking like he’s facing down the inevitable.\n\n\n “I shall assist you as well, Sister Ma?ne,” he says."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n There is nothing much I can do with my resolve to help the orphans while I’m at home. I had a discussion with Lutz and Fran, then after agreeing “life is precious”, we started our secret work.\n\n\n Since I have no idea what, if anything, the kids over there are able to safely digest at this point, we decided that we’ll be soaking crumbled bread in soup to make a bread porridge, and Gil will bring it to them via the secret entrance. With Fran bringing the gods’ blessings in from the front, and Gil sneaking the porridge in from behind, we’ll most likely be able to be able to let the orphans eat without anyone noticing, or so Fran says.\n\n\n “Gil was the most interested in this,” he continues, “so I believe he should be willing to take the initiative.”\n\n\n “If Gil’s doing it,” adds Lutz, “then tell him I can lend him a set of clothes so he can do that kind of dirty work.”\n\n\n That’s all we could do today, but it’s only because I can tell myself that none of those kids are going to starve to death literally tonight that I’m able to relax a little bit. I let my face slacken, breathing a sigh of relief, but Fran’s face remains tense as he looks at me.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, it is very likely that the temple master will disapprove of your plan to save the orphans, so please be very wary of Delia,” he says.\n\n\n “…You think the head priest will be okay with it?”\n\n\n I thought that it wasn’t just the temple master who disapproved, but the head priest as well, but I wonder what Fran thinks?\n\n\n “I shall convey your thoughts to him. You are most assuredly not alone in being chagrined by the state of the orphanage and the treatment of the priests and priestesses there.”\n\n\n “Huh?” I say, tilting my head doubtfully. “I got the exact opposite impression, though?”\n\n\n Fran’s eyes widen momentarily in mild shock, then, with an expression of resignation, casts his eyes downward.\n\n\n “Were you not listening to what Delia was saying? The temple master has more power than the head priest does. In addition, the Father keeps his true intentions deeply concealed so that the temple master cannot nitpick his every move, which makes him very difficult to read, but I feel that he is indeed irritated at the current state of the temple.”\n\n\n “…I had no idea at all.”\n\n\n Where in that conversation had the head priest conveyed his irritation? Is Fran just able to hear his inner thoughts as well as the words he’s saying?\n\n\n As I wrack my brain, trying and failing to understand, Lutz just shrugs his shoulders.\n\n\n “You should probably tell the head priest that Ma?ne didn’t get his meaning,” he tells Fran.\n\n\n “As you say. And it will be very necessary, Sister, for you to learn the particular euphemisms that the nobility cloaks their words in.”\n\n\n The way that they look at me with their tepid eyes, like I’m a useless little child, really hurts.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Over the next few days, as Gil secretly sneaks food in, Fran and I discuss the easiest way to convey our requests to the head priest. We ask Lutz’s opinion as well, and since this involves Ma?ne’s Workshop, Benno gets involved as well, grumbling about how he’s being dragged into another pain in the ass.\n\n\n I originally wanted to get permission from the head priest as soon as possible and get my orphanage improvement plans started by force, but Benno got angry again, yelling about what a thoughtless little girl I am.\n\n\n “Don’t just force your way through! When you’re dealing with the nobility, no matter how much you hate all the extra effort to take a roundabout path, you absolutely have to lay all the groundwork first! Rather, you need to have everything decided in advance. If you just suddenly show up, you can’t even be sure if they’ll talk to you to begin with!”\n\n\n “It is exactly as Master Benno says,” adds Fran. “I know that you typically begin to act the moment you decide on your goals, but when you need to have a conversation, you must first in advance convey to them the relevant information and your requests and then request the meeting. In a meeting with the nobility, you cannot be hasty. You must take as much time as you need to quietly make your preparations and ensure that the outcome will be advantageous for you.”\n\n\n When I, in my shock over seeing the state of the orphanage, kept begging the head priest for help, asking “isn’t there something you can do?”, I was committing a grave breach of manners, Fran tells me. The head priest was unable to make the proper preparations to meet with me, nor had he been able to gather any relevant information.\n\n\n “This time is an excellent opportunity for learning, Sister Ma?ne. Please watch carefully as we arrange this meeting and make the necessary preparations, and then make sure to learn from the experience. This will be important to know going forward.”\n\n\n After all of our various discussions, we determine that, to start, I’ll be taking on the role of orphanage director, then use my funds from Ma?ne’s Workshop to reform the orphanage under the pretext of establishing a workshop in it.\n\n\n We’ll bathe the orphans and thoroughly clean out the orphanage. From there, we’ll set up the workshop in the basement of the boys’ dormitory, then in order to both cook and make paper, we’ll install stoves and bring in the necessary tools.\n\n\n We’ll divide the people living in the orphanage into teams―the forest gathering and paper-making team, the orphanage housework team, and the temple work team―and then rotate them through each one in one-month intervals until they have experienced everything. Then, we’ll ask everyone their preference and assign them to that team. They’ll be able to freely chose what they want to do.\n\n\n As we discover the kinds of clothing and tools we’ll be needing, we’ll have to go through Benno to acquire them. In order to acquire the funds we need to do that, I asked Lutz and Ralph to make wooden clothes hangers. Specifically, the kind of clothes hangers I’m familiar with, built to mimic the roundness of human shoulders. “These will keep clothes looking nicer than the cross-shaped hangars I saw at the used clothing store,” I told Benno, and with glimmering eyes he immediately pounced on it.\n\n\n Thank you, come again.\n\n\n “What is the ultimate goal of the orphanage branch of Ma?ne’s Workshop?” Benno asks, looking at me. I know that if I can’t answer him now, he’ll get mad at me for being thoughtless again.\n\n\n “To make sure the orphanage can cover its living expenses. When the gods’ blessings are insufficient, I think it would be good for them to be able to earn the money they need in order to buy enough food to make up for it.”\n\n\n “Just food?”\n\n\n “The temple generally provides the bare necessities of what they need to live, so I think it’ll be fine if they’re able to earn enough to pay for food.”\n\n\n As I answer Benno’s question, Lutz starts working through the calculations for the price of the paper and the cost of the necessary amount of food.\n\n\n “…If it’s just food, then it’s way easier to make that happen that I thought.”\n\n\n Lutz had originally said that if the orphans didn’t have money, then they could gather food in the forest, but when you think of how large the orphanage actually is, there’s no way that they’d be able to sustainably gather all that they need. But, if you consider that they’d be able to earn enough money through the workshop, then if things go according to plan they’ll be able to feed themselves out of the workshop’s funds.\n\n\n “If you’re providing funds,” says Benno, “is there any point to having them learn how to gather food?”\n\n\n “I just want them to learn how while they’re out there making paper. If they know, and if they’re starving to death, then they’ll be able to eat something, right? If they don’t know any better, then they might pick poisonous mushrooms like I used to.”\n\n\n “You did pick a ton of poison mushrooms, didn’t you…” says Lutz.\n\n\n Fran, meanwhile, worked in the shadows to convey as much of the information he could to the head priest, and get his informal approval to my plan to become the orphanage’s director and establish a branch of my workshop. On top of that, he arranged a meeting with the head priest to have a formal discussion about it.\n\n\n It looks like formally requesting a meeting must take place several days in advance, so Fran teaches me how to format that particular letter, and I write it out.\n\n\n …Man, nobles are a pain in the butt.\n\n\n By the time the head priest’s written invitation arrives, the orphans are much healthier due to Gil’s secret efforts. He tells me that they’ve started gaining an appetite, and have moved on from eating only soup to being able to eat a little bit of solid food, and they’re starting to get a little more lively. It sounds like they’re getting to the point where they’re healthy enough to be scrubbed all the way clean while their absolutely filthy rooms are cleaned out.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The head priest had told me to meet him after third bell, so when it chimes, I walk together with Fran to his chambers. Back in my rooms, Gil and Lutz are on standby, ready to leap into motion at any time.\n\n\n “Father,” I say, “Thank you for taking the time to meet with me.”\n\n\n “Ah, Ma?ne. …Come this way.”\n\n\n It seems that the head priest has already had people clear out, since there’s nobody else in his room apart from Arnaud. As I start walking to his work desk, as I usually do, he stands up and starts walking towards his bed.\n\n\n “Father?!” says Arnaud, surprised.\n\n\n Fran looks just as shocked, his eyes wide. I have no idea what’s happening, but I follow behind the head priest anyway. He pushes the canopy around his bed aside, beckoning me closer. I tilt my head, wondering if there’s something in deeper behind the bed, as I cautiously approach. Behind the canopy, I can see another door.\n\n\n “We’ll have our conversation in here,” he says.\n\n\n The head priest holds his hand out before the door, as if presenting it to a fingerprint scanner. In that moment, a glimmering blue-white magic circle springs into existence, and from the gem on the ring on his right finger a bright red light shines forth. The light traces the edge of the circle once, then dims.\n\n\n “No attendants can pass through this door. Come here, Ma?ne.”\n\n\n The door clacks as he pushes it open, then he walks through, with neither Arnaud nor Fran following behind. When I see the dark room beyond, I’m momentarily filled with anxiety, and I glance back over my shoulder at Fran. He gives me a slight nod, urging me forward.\n\n\n “P… pardon my intrusion,” I say, stepping through the door.\n\n\n As soon as I pass through the door and close it behind me, leaving the room in pitch darkness, windows suddenly appear, flooding the room with light, just as if shutters had opened, revealing the windows beyond.\n\n\n “Whoa?!”\n\n\n As I squint, shielding my eyes and waiting for them to adjust, I hear the rustling of the head priest moving things around the room. I slowly open my eyes, and see that the formerly pitch-black room has revealed itself to be something that distinctly reminds me of a university professor’s office.\n\n\n Every table and shelf is covered in piles of scrolls, sheafs of parchment, and stacks of several books. On racks I can see rows of tools that I’ve never seen before that somehow look like some kind of scientific equipment. In the corner, I see a couch that looks like it’s supposed to be for relaxing, but there are yet more piles of documents scattered across it.\n\n\n With no attendants allowed in here to keep everything neatly in its place, this room looks nothing like the head priest’s other rooms, but instead very much like his own private space.\n\n\n “You cannot enter this room unless you possess a certain amount of mana. I think you might be the only priest currently living at the temple besides myself who can even enter this room. This is a perfect place for a conversation.”\n\n\n “This is a really cool secret room! It’s, like, super magical…”\n\n\n The head priest looks over at me as he shoves the stacks of papers on the couch aside.\n\n\n “…Your room should have something like this, shouldn’t it?”\n\n\n “Really? I didn’t know that.”\n\n\n My bed doesn’t have a canopy on it. All I have is the frame, without even a mattress on it. Thinking back on the time I collapsed though, it might be a good idea for me to get some sort of bedding on there.\n\n\n “Your mana needs to be registered with the door, so you may not be able to use it.”\n\n\n “Registered how?”\n\n\n “That’s not important at the moment. Let’s discuss what we are here for. Sit over there, please.”\n\n\n The head priest forcibly changes the topic, indicating the spot that he’d just cleared on the couch for me. He pulls his desk chair over for himself to sit on. When I look up at him, his face isn’t guarded and expressionless like Fran’s. His brow is furrowed, looking displeased.\n\n\n …Is he about to spoil me?\n\n\n I’ve been on the receiving end of several lectures from Fran over the last few days, so I think I can guess what’s about to happen today. I wonder if he perhaps picked this particular place so that he can lecture me to a level that he can’t do in front of the attendants? Even if I want Fran to come save me, there’s nobody in here but the two of us, nobody will be coming to my aid.\n\n\n “Uh, umm, so, Father. Why might you have brought me here?”\n\n\n “I heard from Fran that you won’t understand me if I were to use the roundabout phrasing that we noblemen typically use,” he replies.\n\n\n He looks pointedly down at me. Since he is normally the type to keep his face cool and expressionless, seeing his brow furrowed in displeasure is actually very scary. Unlike Benno, whose scoldings echo like thunder, the head priest’s anger is cold, slowly freezing me from the feet up.\n\n\n “Similarly,” he says, “the other day, you thoughtlessly said some very important and very dangerous things very bluntly. Had you noticed that one of the Reverend’s attendants was in my room on business?”\n\n\n “I didn’t, no. Not at all.”\n\n\n “Criticizing the Reverend’s actions right in front of his attendant, for you to do such a thing…” he takes a slow breath. “In other words, you put my life at risk with that conversation. You had no awareness of this fact, did you?”\n\n\n “…I’m, I’m very sorry.”\n\n\n I thought that what I’d been doing was trying to get the head priest to understand the situation, but what I’d actually been doing is criticizing how the temple master runs things. Everyone there, from the head priest to the attendants, must have been frozen solid with terror.\n\n\n “At the very least, you will learn the names and faces of the other blue-robed clergy, as well as the faces of their attendants. If you lack awareness of what is happening around you, what might your enemies be doing without your knowing? You are far too careless.”\n\n\n His flabbergasted expression looks a lot like Benno’s. It looks like, no matter where I go, I’ll get scolded.\n\n\n “…Mister Benno calls me thoughtless a lot,” I say.\n\n\n “Come to think of it, he did say you lacked wariness and didn’t learn your lesson no matter how many times you are deceived. I agree wholeheartedly with his opinion. As a blue-robed priestess, you will be working alongside the nobility, so you must learn and understand how nobles interact.”\n\n\n “Yes, Father.”\n\n\n The head priest seems to be concerned entirely about my position. Just like Fran had said, his true motives had been so concealed that I hadn’t been able to read them, but it seems like he’s been protecting me from the temple master.\n\n\n “You have no sense that would allow you to uncover the meaning hidden within my words, and no matter what your opinion may be you express it nakedly, yet in noble society this can be quite literally fatal. You must not, by any means, speak with such fright as you did. As I am incapable of determining whether or not I am successfully communicating my intentions to you, I have judged it best to use this room whenever I need to have a discussion with you that I do not wish for others to hear.”\n\n\n “I truly am very sorry, Father.”\n\n\n Since the head priest is unable to tell me what he truly means without saying it frankly, it seems like he’s decided to have our conversations here. I know it’s a huge bother, but I’m relieved to be able to talk openly with him.\n\n\n “I heard this from Fran,” he says, “but it seems you have decided that you will become the orphanage’s director, then? You had said that you were unable to bear that responsibility; will you truly be able to do this?”\n\n\n He studies me closely, his coldly gleaming eyes seeming to stare directly into my heart. I straighten up, solidifying my desire to help. I look right back at him, trying to convey my determination.\n\n\n “To be honest, the concept of taking responsibility is still terrifying. However, things there cannot stay as they are, so if I am able to help, I want to do it.”\n\n\n “Hm. If you’re resolved to do it, then I don’t mind.”\n\n\n The fact that he agreed so easily is almost a total letdown.\n\n\n “Huh? I say, looking quizzically up at him. \"You’re okay with it?”\n\n\n “I already told Fran this informally, so you should have already received my approval, haven’t you?”\n\n\n “I did hear that, but that was so different from what I’d heard from you during our last conversation that I was pretty shocked…”\n\n\n “Since I spoke circuitously, you didn’t understand, so something like that was inevitable.”\n\n\n “Whoa, I’m sorry.”\n\n\n As I apologize for what must have been the thousandth time, the head priest picks up a few sheets of paper. He skims over them briefly, then looks back up at me.\n\n\n “I heard the general details from Fran, but I wasn’t able to understand them. I believe this may be because Fran did not have a complete understanding himself. He said that your conversations contained a lot of language and unspoken understanding peculiar to merchants. Please, explain to me just what you plan to do once you’ve become the orphanage’s director.”\n\n\n I start to explain the plan that everyone’s come up with.\n\n\n “I will establish Ma?ne’s Workshop within the orphanage. My first priority is to improve the dietary conditions of the children who will serve as my workers, as well as thoroughly clean the orphanage that they will be operating out of. I will then install the tools and equipment necessary for their work. From there, in order to improve their diet, I plan to enable them to cook their own meals. If they are able to make soup for themselves, then when they add that to the gods’ blessings, they will be able to dramatically improve their nutrition.”\n\n\n “I see,” he says, glancing at me. “And what did he mean by you taking everyone in the orphanage as your attendant?”\n\n\n “…If they are my attendants, then I’ll be able to send them on errands outside the temple.”\n\n\n “If that’s the only reason, then give up on that. If, for instance, another blue-robe joins the temple and there are no capable individuals left in the orphanage to become their attendants, than your having acquired all of them will inadvertently cause strife. If you’re the director, then it should be fine if you were to send them outside on errands.”\n\n\n “Understood.”\n\n\n If I can bring the children out of the temple, then there’s no particular reason for me to make them my attendants. I nod to show my understanding.\n\n\n “When you have their diets under control, then what?”\n\n\n “I plan to have them make plant-based paper for me. Originally, I was capable of making this with only myself and Lutz, so once the children are taught the proper method, even they should be able to make it.”\n\n\n “Plant-based paper, you say…”\n\n\n His eyes flick briefly to the stack of paper on his desk. Come to think of it, out of all of the gifts that Benno had brought him, he had been most interested in the paper.\n\n\n “To prevent, for instance, misappropriation,” I say, “I’ve already signed a magical contract ensuring that all products produced by Ma?ne’s Workshop will be sold through the Gilberta Company, so I’m afraid it can’t be taken directly by the temple.”\n\n\n “Excellent judgement, very merchant-like. So, for instance, even if the Reverend were to find out about this, he would not be able to abscond with it.” His eyes narrow in disinterest. “Very good. Then, when you sell the paper, what next?”\n\n\n “Once they sell the product, they will be able to buy enough food to fill their needs. If they do so, then I will not need to bring them food directly, and they will not risk starvation depending on the number of blue-robed priests and priestesses.”\n\n\n “Why would someone as ordinarily apathetic to others as you go so far as to do this, even though you stand to gain nothing from this highly difficult task?”\n\n\n The intensity in his eyes tells me that this is the most important question he wanted to ask. I look back at him evenly.\n\n\n “It would be so that I could protect my ability to read without worry, would it not?”\n\n\n “What did you say?” he says, his eyes opening wide in disbelief.\n\n\n “Knowing that I am separated by a single wall from children who are starving to death, I cannot help but be upset. Although I’m fine while I am immersed in a book, the moment I stop reading I remember that awful scene. The guilt and the disgust are too much to bear.”\n\n\n “So, in other words, it is for the sole purpose of removing obstacles in the way of your reading that you are taking on the role of orphanage director and establishing your workshop?”\n\n\n “Precisely,” I say, with a big nod.\n\n\n The head priest rubs at his temples.\n\n\n “You are, beyond all expectations, a colossal idiot.”\n\n\n “So I am often told,” I reply mildly.\n\n\n “…Fine. What is your timeframe? How long do you estimate this will take now that you’ve been given permission?”\n\n\n “My initial preparations are nearly finished, so given the current season, we should be able to be producing paper, selling it, and purchasing food within the month.”\n\n\n “Oh?” he asks, impressed.\n\n\n He murmurs to himself about how thorough my preparations are this time. Both Benno and Fran looked carefully over the plan more times than I could count, making sure it was airtight from both a merchant’s and a noble’s standpoint, so there should be no problems here at all. Their statement that the weakest link in the plan was me is still fresh in my mind.\n\n\n “Very well. I’ll approve your plan.”\n\n\n “Thank you very much,” I reply. “Fran had told me that if I explained everything thoroughly, you in particular would be sure to understand. Mister Benno thinks highly of you as well, saying that you have excellent eyes for a priest, and told me that if I had to have a discussion with anyone at the temple, then it should be with you. …If I may ask, why are you so different compared to the other priests?”\n\n\n If I’d asked him anywhere else but here, he’d probably scold me to no end. Sure enough, as soon as I do, he sighs, telling me that I shouldn’t ask things like that outside of this room.\n\n\n “I don’t intend on going into the precise details, but much like you, I was not raised here in the temple. I was raised instead in noble society, then joined the temple for certain reasons. That’s all the more why I am so irritated with the Reverend’s way of doing things, but as things are right now there is no real benefit in standing up to him. I would ask you to take care not to provoke any more of his anger than you already have.”\n\n\n “…Will my management of the orphanage not provoke his anger?”\n\n\n If the orphans are able to earn a wage for themselves, that would fly in the face of the way things have been done until now. When I nervously ask my question, he snorts, asking why I’m only worried about this now.\n\n\n “For now, I intend on making it appear that I am forcing this role on you, but you should take care not to do anything too ostentatious. In your particular case, your idea of common knowledge is so different from the rest of ours that I quite frankly have no idea what you might get up to. No matter what you want to do, tell me first. Also, pay very close attention to what Fran tells you. Am I clear?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir,” I reply.\n\n\n After he reminds me, over and over, to report to, contact, and consult with him, I leave his secret room and, with Fran, head back to my rooms.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, how did it go?” asks Lutz.\n\n\n “He was really mad at me. He told me I need to be serious about studying how nobles work. He called me thoughtless and careless, too…”\n\n\n “So, uh, does that mean that we can’t work on the orphanage?”\n\n\n Lutz and Gil look worriedly at me, anxiety clouding their faces. I frantically shake my head.\n\n\n “No, no, I’m the director now. We’re okay to set up the workshop. But, seriously, no matter where I go, someone always gets mad at me…”\n\n\n “Well, that’s just because you’re you,” laughs Lutz, patting me on the head.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Before we can get our plan fully started, there’s one last thing that remains for me to do: I need to talk to Delia. Her job is to report information to the temple master, and I want to bribe her into secrecy.\n\n\n No matter how well I think I’m hiding things from her, my other two attendants have been wandering about, and Benno and Lutz have been constantly coming and going. If the orphanage suddenly starts getting more lively, then it would be impossible for her not to notice what’s happening. However, until the workshop is actually on track to being profitable, I don’t want the temple master interfering.\n\n\n Since Delia had said that if I was able to help the orphans, then I should, I think that she will at least agree with the actual idea of me helping the orphans. I’d expect that since we’ve made all of the preparations necessary to help them, she’s probably not going to say she’d rather let them die.\n\n\n I decided to look her straight in the eye and tell her honestly. Since Delia also tells me when she meets with the temple master’s other attendants, I think it’s better to ask her for her help directly, rather than beating around the bush.\n\n\n “So, Delia. I’m planning on doing something to help the orphans who haven’t been baptized, and I don’t want the temple master to interfere with that. I would like you to keep quiet about this for now. This is what you can do to help the orphans, and I think that helping them is something you want to do. Can I ask you to do this for me, perhaps?”\n\n\n Delia is silent for a long time, but then she squeezes her eyes shut, shaking her head like she’s trying to clear it of something she’s remembered.\n\n\n “…I don’t want to go to the orphanage. I don’t want to remember anything about it, and I don’t want to have anything to do with it.”\n\n\n “Yes, I know that. That’s why I think you should stay here and keep an eye on the cooks. All I want you to do is look the other way, just a little. Can you do that?”\n\n\n Keeping track of the ingredients and monitoring the cooks is an absolutely essential task, so someone absolutely needs to be left in my rooms. If I leave that task to Delia, who doesn’t want to go to the orphanage, then there’s no need for Delia herself to face it at all.\n\n\n For a moment, she looks slightly relieved, but then she turns her head away haughtily. “Fine then, I’ll stay quiet. But let’s be clear: I’m not doing this for your sake. I’m doing it for the orphans. Don’t think that you’ve moved me by your kindness.”\n\n\n I’m very relieved to hear her promise to keep quiet, and I promise her something in return.\n\n\n “Thank you, Delia. I’m definitely going to save them.”\n\n\n “I, I’m not particularly asking you for anything! But no matter what you’re doing, if you mess this up, I’m never going to forgive you.”\n\n\n She’s acting very prickly, but is it wrong for me to think that she’s somehow hopeful about this?"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n After finishing lunch, we immediately get to work on cleaning up the orphanage. However, it’s the orphans actually doing the work.\n\n\n Historically, the general work schedule has been that laundry is done early in the morning and the other cleaning is done in the afternoon, but since at the moment there’s a surplus of gray-robed priests, everything is generally finished during the morning. So, during the afternoons, there’s likely to be a large number of priests without anything to really do, which is why we’ve decided to kick off our great cleaning plans now.\n\n\n The officially-stated reason for this cleanup is to ensure that when I, a blue-robed apprentice priestess, come to visit the orphanage as part of my inauguration as its director, I do not see anything unsightly. It seems like using an excuse like this for forcing everyone to do such an enormous, unusual task is likely to make it easy for everyone in the orphanage to accept.\n\n\n The main objective of this major cleanup operation is, of course, to clean up the orphanage, but I’m also using this as an opportunity to teach the orphans that if they work hard, they’ll get a reward. In order to that, I’m having the cooks make soup that I can give to the people cleaning as thanks for their hard work, and in order to reward the people who take the most initiative I’m planning on giving out buttered potatoes―or, more accurately, buttered kalfe―to the thirty of them who stand out the most.\n\n\n The work to clean out the orphanage can be divided into washing the children while it’s still warm out, cleaning out the basement of the girls’ dormitory where the unbaptized children are staying, cleaning the other floors of the girls’ dormitory, cleaning out the basement of the boys’ dormitory and installing the workshop equipment there, and cleaning up the other floors of the boys’ dormitory. I’ll be having everyone split into teams and take on different aspects of the work.\n\n\n When Benno and I had suggested this, Fran and Gil both reacted with utter shock. They explained that the servant work at the temple consisted of laundry, cleaning, and prayer. In the morning, they said, everyone washes the laundry, then everyone prays. Essentially, everyone does the same work at the same time. Nobody’s ever really split up to work on different things before, it seems.\n\n\n After we explained that there’s a wide range of things that need to be done, and that things like carrying in the workshop equipment are very physically demanding, they agreed to actually split up the work this time.\n\n\n “I wonder, even if we split them into groups and clearly explain things to them, will they really do their work?” I ask.\n\n\n “It’ll be fine,” says Gil, “because everyone in the orphanage knows that Fran’s the head priest’s attendant.”\n\n\n According to Gil, the gray-robed priests and apprentices of the orphanage recognize Fran, who is deeply trusted by the head priest himself, as very much their superior. If he’s the one giving directions, then just about everyone will follow them, even though some of them might grumble about it.\n\n\n “There will… still be a few children who do not listen to what they are told,” says Fran, glancing briefly at Gil.\n\n\n Gil averts his gaze. Although he’s a pretty hard worker now, it wasn’t too long ago that he was a real problem child that the other gray-robed priests had to constantly fight to keep under control.\n\n\n Gil and Fran will be making the rounds, making sure that the cleaning is going well, finding out who is working hard and who is running away without doing anything, and checking in with me to report on the overall progress. Lutz will be supervising the cleaning of the basement of the boys’ dorm, since that’s the future site of Ma?ne’s Workshop, and helping to bring in the equipment. After that, he’ll make the buttered kalfe there in the basement. Delia will be keeping an eye on the cooks and cleaning the first floor of my rooms.\n\n\n “I’ll be going―”\n\n\n “You’re staying here,” Lutz says. “It’ll be a big problem if you collapse somewhere.”\n\n\n Before I can finish saying that I want to go too, Lutz stops me. As I groan, at a loss for words, Gil looks at me in astonishment.\n\n\n “So, Sister Ma?ne. Since all this cleaning is happening so that a blue-robed priestess can come to visit, wouldn’t it be a problem if you were to show up before it was actually done?”\n\n\n “I guess you’re right…”\n\n\n Since Fran won’t be with me, I can’t go to the library, either, so I let out a big sigh. Fran, looking at me with a fond smile, places a single sheet of paper in front of me. It’s covered with his neat handwriting, each precisely-formed letter reflecting his meticulous personality.\n\n\n “There are many things that you must learn, Sister Ma?ne. Firstly, when you go to the orphanage this evening and give your inaugural address, I would like for you to have learned this greeting entirely by heart. Please pay close attention in particular to the names of the gods so that you do not say them incorrectly.”\n\n\n He also wrote me a cheat sheet, but it looks like I really should have as much of this memorized as possible. I look over the carefully-written sentences, then sigh. Fran, seeing this, smiles broadly, then starts placing a series of wooden boards on my desk, one by one.\n\n\n “If you have the time, I would like for you to memorize this list of the teas and milks that have been brought here for your rooms, as well as where they originated. This is the pairing that you like. This is Master Benno’s, this is Master Lutz’s, and this is the Father’s preferred pairing.”\n\n\n “Huh? What?” I say, flabbergasted.\n\n\n “It is essential to memorize the tastes of those who come visit frequently,” he says.\n\n\n I decide not to mention that the head priest doesn’t actually come here. It’s probably a good idea to learn what my boss, who I work alongside, likes to drink.\n\n\n Lutz, trying desperately to suppress a burst of laughter, gives me a big thumbs up.\n\n\n “This is great, Ma?ne! Look at all the stuff you get to read!”\n\n\n “I like reading, yeah, but… I’m really bad at memorizing…”\n\n\n Unless it’s something I’m actually interested in, my brain just isn’t good at holding onto information. Whenever I just mechanically go through book after book, the contents of one book slip out of my head the moment I start reading the next.\n\n\n My shoulders droop as I reach dejectedly towards Fran’s pile of documents.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Fran returns after the fifth bell rings. He writes a series of names onto a wooden slip, his pen scratching across its surface, listing the names and appearances of the children who took initiative and tried hard, as well as the children who hid away from their work.\n\n\n “Although the thorough bathing of the youngest children was the task you were most concerned about,” he says, “we were able to use the soap and towels we prepared to finish bathing them while it was still warm enough out. They are currently being dressed in cheap, second-hand clothes, and fresh straw is being packed into sheets.”\n\n\n The sheets were bought cheaply, so they’re patched together, but right now the children are in the process of filling clean sheets with straw we bought from a local farmer to make their own bedding.\n\n\n “There aren’t any sick or unresponsive children, are there?” I ask.\n\n\n “No, they are all fine. I believe this is perhaps the result of Gil having brought them food these past few days. Those children have become to adore Gil as a messiah, it seems, and as he has been saying that this at your orders, you are likely so adored as well.”\n\n\n Being told that to my face is actually pretty embarrassing, but I’m happy to hear that those kids have gotten a little healthier.\n\n\n “A handful of the priestesses and apprentices who were assigned to wash the children are helping stuff the bedding, and the rest of them have been reassigned to help with the rest of the cleaning. Now then, I must make my rounds again.”\n\n\n “Thank you, Fran. I’ll leave it to you.”\n\n\n Fran gives me a slight bow, then heads back to the orphanage again. Shortly afterward, Lutz returns.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, we’re done cleaning up the basement in the boys’ dorms. We’re going to start installing the workshop equipment now.”\n\n\n “Got it. Thanks, Lutz!”\n\n\n “Man, though, those guys are amazing,” he says over his shoulder as he takes off. “They’re really used to cleaning. They’re crazy fast at it!”\n\n\n As soon as Lutz is gone, Fran comes back again to write down a list of names he heard from Gil, then quickly heads off again.\n\n\n While everyone else is so busy, I just sit at the work desk that had arrived for me just a few days ago, staring at Fran’s handwriting. Man, these gods have some long names. And there’s so many of them too. I kind of want to ask the head priest if I could come up with some nice, friendly nicknames for them.\n\n\n Since Delia is supposed to be keeping an eye on the kitchen while she’s cleaning, the kitchen door has been left open, and the delicious scent of the soup I’ll be giving out as a reward drifts through the air. As I sit there, thinking about stupid things, the cleaning comes to an end.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne,” says Gil, “the boys’ dorm is all cleaned out.”\n\n\n “Thanks for all the help, Gil! So it’s just the girls’ dorm left now, right?”\n\n\n “Right. But boys can’t enter the girls’ dormitory except for the dining hall.”\n\n\n “So, can you get started on getting the dining hall ready for the soup, then?”\n\n\n “Got it!” he says, running excitedly from the room.\n\n\n As he leaves, Lutz arrives.\n\n\n “Hey, Ma?ne. We’re all done setting up the workshop, so we’ve started steaming the kalfe. Sound good?”\n\n\n “Sound good…? Wait, you’ve already started though, right?” I chuckle. “Well, good timing either way. Gil just went to get the dining hall set up.”\n\n\n Lutz leans in closer, lowering his voice. “Uh, so those kids are saying that they’ve never even seen a kalfe before. They’ve only ever seen cooked food. Even though all I’m basically doing is just steaming them, they’re all super curious. They’ve been crowding around me to watch. It’s been pretty hard to actually do anything.”\n\n\n “…Ahh, right, they’ve only ever seen the gods’ blessings, so they’ve never done any actual cooking in the orphanage. It’s natural for them to be curious if they’ve never seen raw ingredients before, I guess?”\n\n\n Come to think of it, I read in some magazine somewhere that even in Japan there’s plenty of kids who only know what carrots look like because they’ve bought them in a supermarket and have never actually seen them growing, so when they see fields full of leaves they don’t actually understand what they’re looking at. If something like that can happen in a country like Japan where all kinds of information is so readily available, then it’s not strange at all that people here wouldn’t know much of anything outside of what they experienced in their everyday lives.\n\n\n “So, how about I go teach them how to butter them?”\n\n\n With butter and knife in hand, he heads out again, grinning. Shortly thereafter, Fran returns.\n\n\n “As expected, cleaning the basement of the girls’ dormitory, where the youngest children were living, has been a very difficult task. Currently, everyone who had been assigned to cleaning the girls’ dormitory is assisting. It should be done shortly. Additionally, unlike the boys’ dormitory, there are not very many people living in the girls’ dormitory at the moment, so the unbaptized children have been given use of some of the small rooms on the first floor as well. Presently, the straw-stuffed bedding and changes of clothing are being brought in.”\n\n\n I breathe a sigh of relief, hearing that report. Making sure that those children had a place to sleep is very important.\n\n\n “Have you memorized your greeting, Sister?”\n\n\n “…More-or-less. But, just to be safe, can I bring this paper with me?”\n\n\n “Certainly. Now then, please call for me when you are ready to leave. Delia, please tend to Sister Ma?ne’s preparations.”\n\n\n As Fran heads downstairs, Delia comes up to help me get my hair in order. She sits me down in front of the dresser and slides my hairpin out. As she picks up the comb, she looks at me in the mirror, her face a mix of pain and sorrow.\n\n\n “…Did you save them?”\n\n\n “I did,” I reply. “It seems they’re now healthy enough to be able to stuff their own bedding with straw.”\n\n\n “Ah.”\n\n\n Even though I just told her I’d been able to help them, her expression doesn’t lighten at all. She averts her eyes, lips pursed as if she’s swallowed something bitter.\n\n\n “…Delia, why are you looking so sad? Aren’t you happy?”\n\n\n “I am, but… it’s just frustrating. Why… why didn’t you save me back then?”\n\n\n “I wasn’t even here yet, so I couldn’t have—”\n\n\n “I know that!” she yells. It looks like she couldn’t stop herself, even though she knows she’s just venting her anger on me. “I know that, but…”\n\n\n Her pale blue eyes fill with tears that look like they might spill over at any moment. It hurts me to imagine how many painful memories she must have had to endure before her baptism, and how many times she must have wished to be saved.\n\n\n “I wasn’t there in time to help you back then, but I’ll try to be there for you next time. I’ll really be there for you, so… don’t cry.”\n\n\n “I’m not crying!!” she yells, scrubbing roughly at her eyes.\n\n\n “S, sorr—”\n\n\n “Don’t apologize to your attendant!”\n\n\n “…Okay.”\n\n\n It seems like I might have wounded her pride by pointing out that she’s crying.\n\n\n …I think the poor girl might be just a bit unreasonable, though.\n\n\n Since it sounds like my inauguration as orphanage director is something of a public occasion, we’ve decided that I’ll be wearing the same hairpin that I did for my baptismal ceremony, the one with wisteria flowers.\n\n\n “This is an unusual ornament,” says Delia.\n\n\n “It’s the hairpin that I made for my baptismal ceremony. The Gilberta Company is starting to sell them.”\n\n\n “…You made this? By yourself?”\n\n\n “I had some help, but yes, I can make things like that. If I have the materials, of course.”\n\n\n “The materials…” she says, her eyes fixated on the hairpin as if she’s a predator locked onto her prey.\n\n\n After she finishes combing out my hair, I put my hairpin in. Delia doesn’t know how to do it yet, so I have to do it myself.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne,” says Fran, “we have finished our preparations to depart.”\n\n\n The soup has been poured into several pots and loaded into the wagon. Behind Fran, I see a few gray-robed priests I haven’t seen before.\n\n\n “These are the priests who will be assisting in carrying in and serving the soup,” he says.\n\n\n “Ah, excellent. Thank you,” I say to them.\n\n\n “No,” one replies, “it is we who should be thanking you. The gods’ blessings have been very spare as of late, so everyone will be very grateful for this.”\n\n\n “Oh, but this is not the gods’ blessings. This is a reward from me.”\n\n\n “Huh? A reward?”\n\n\n He blinks, as if unsure what I actually mean. I just smile at him, ending the conversation.\n\n\n Fran holds me in his arms, and we make our way around the building, heading along the walkways until we reach the front door of the orphanage. Since we’re taking the long way around, it’s actually a surprisingly long walk. If I’d been on foot, the priests wouldn’t have been able to match my walking speed.\n\n\n He lets me down before the orphanage’s door, then makes sure that neither my hair nor my clothing has gotten disheveled. A priest, seeing that everything’s in order, pulls the door open with a creak, then in a clear, carrying voice, calls out to everyone inside.\n\n\n “Everyone, by the blessings of the highest of all gods who rule over all in the high, lofty skies and those of the five gods who rule over all in the wide, vast earth, the priestess who has become the new orphanage director has arrived.”\n\n\n On the other side of the door is the dining hall. At first, I’m a little surprised that what I see through the front door are the rows of long tables that fill the room, but when I think about how the gods’ blessings must be carried in by hand, and that the boys only enter this building for the sake of going to the dining hall, it seems pretty reasonable.\n\n\n Seated along the tables were rows of gray-robed people, but as soon as the priest called out his introduction they all stood up in unison, turning to face me. I feel the pressure of everyone staring at me, appraisingly, and I have to fight the urge to look away and to shield myself from their gazes.\n\n\n “Let us welcome her, and raise our prayers to the heavens. We pray to the gods!”\n\n\n When everyone, as a group, suddenly snaps into the Glico pose, I don’t just fail to look away, but I find myself just staring.\n\n\n “This way, Sister,” says Fran.\n\n\n He takes my hand, guiding me along a carpet that has been laid out towards a table. The priests in the front of the crowd that are easiest for me to see are all holding their prayer poses perfectly, but behind them I can see the younger children having trouble keeping their balance. They’re a good match for me.\n\n\n As the prayer ends and all eyes return to me, Fran gently lifts me up and sets me down to stand on the table. Quietly, he murmurs in my ear.\n\n\n “As nobly as you can, please.”\n\n\n When it comes to getting gray-robed priests to follow your orders, it seems that the first impression is key. Just like Gil knew who I was right from the start, it seems like it’s common knowledge among the gray-robed clergy that I, who joined the temple as a blue-robed priestess, am a commoner. Fran cautioned me that if I give off the impression that I lack self-confidence, they’re not going to take me seriously, so I must show them the dignity of a noble.\n\n\n I must stand proudly and never avert my gaze. My smile should show as much calm as I can manage. The basics of it are the same as when I’d come with Benno to deliver my donation to the temple.\n\n\n Fran had told me that if it absolutely comes to it, I should feel free to release a bit of my mana to lightly coerce them. That will make them understand the difference in our statures, he said, with a smile. I really don’t want them to be weirdly terrified of me, though, so I hope that I can get out of this without having to use my mana at all.\n\n\n I’ve somehow managed to memorize my greeting, but the only experience I have speaking in front of a crowd like this was during Urano days, back when I had to present my bachelor’s thesis, or even way back in elementary school when I’d won some kind of award for my book report and nearly died of embarrassment while having to read it out loud to the entire student body.\n\n\n As everyone in the crowd stares at me, I force myself to take a slow breath, still shivering with tension. When I do, I feel the flowers hanging from my hairpin gently sway behind me. Reminded that I have the hairpin that my whole family made for me, I find myself relaxing, just a little bit.\n\n\n “It is a pleasure to meet all of you on this day that so shines with the blessing of the god of fire, Leidenschaft. My name is Ma?ne. I have been entrusted with the duty of being the director of this orphanage. I am grateful, from the bottom of my heart, that you have so willingly listened to my wishes today and given me such warm welcome.”\n\n\n Now that I’ve expressed my thanks for the welcome and stated my reason for being here in such pretty, ornate words, I need to tie it all back together by reciting the names of the gods.\n\n\n “Let us now lift our prayers and gratitude to the highest of all gods, who rule over all in the high, lofty skies, and to the five gods who rule over all in the wide, vast earth: the goddess of water, Frühtr?ne, the god of fire, Leidenschaft, the goddess of wind, Schutzaria, and the god of life, Ewigeliebe.”\n\n\n It seems like the remarks Fran had written out for me are some kind of standardized speech in the temple. In response to my words, the priests all immediately assume the prayer pose.\n\n\n “We pray to the gods! We give thanks to the gods!”\n\n\n Ever since coming to the temple, I’ve had to practice my prayers with Fran and the head priest, so I’ve gotten just a little bit better at the prayer pose. I’m still not actually good at it, but even still, my balance is good enough now that I’m not risking falling over. Todays prayer was, if I do say so myself, excellent work.\n\n\n Next, now that my speech is done and I’ve gotten over the part that I was nervous about the most, it’s time to pass out the rewards.\n\n\n “You have done such an excellent job today in cleaning the orphanage for my sake. I brought you a reward. Fran, if you will, please have it served to everyone who worked hard today.”\n\n\n “As you wish, Sister,” he replies.\n\n\n Fran takes out a wooden slip and reads off the names of the people who didn’t help with the cleaning. As he does so, the priests who are helping pass out the soup walk around, serving it to everyone except for the people whose names were called.\n\n\n As I look on, reminded of food being served at a school cafeteria, a young boy, about as old as Gil, who hadn’t gotten any soup turns to glare at me, his face bright red.\n\n\n “You’re mean! This isn’t equal!” he yells, sounding just like Gil did at the start. “The gods’ blessings are given equally to everyone! Even a commoner like you should—”\n\n\n “Indeed,” I reply, “the gods’ blessings are given equally.”\n\n\n I smile pleasantly at him.\n\n\n “But these are not the gods’ blessings. I told you that this was a reward given to those who worked hard, did I not? Were you perhaps not listening? A reward is not equal. I’m afraid that I cannot reward those who do not work. It is said that if any would not work, neither should he eat.1 Everyone, please remember this.”\n\n\n The boy stares dumbly at me, his anger forgotten, as if he’d been completely caught off guard by my rebuttal.\n\n\n “…A, a reward?”\n\n\n “That’s right, a reward. Please, try to work hard next time. Now, I have something more for those of you who worked exceptionally hard for me. When your name is called, please bring your plate to the front of the room.”\n\n\n At that, a gray-robed priest opens the lid of the steamer that contains the buttered kalfe Lutz made. The smell of butter wafts gently out into the room. As Fran begins reading off names, priests and priestesses start walking hesitantly forward holding their plates, looking fearfully around the room. One by one, the buttered kalfe are placed onto each priest’s plate.\n\n\n “I heard you were the quickest to run to get the children and help wash them. I very much appreciate it.”\n\n\n “You’re very fast at cleaning, I hear? Lutz had great praise for you.”\n\n\n “You took the initiative to carry some of the heaviest things, didn’t you? Thank you for your hard work.”\n\n\n All I’m doing is reading off of the notes I made when Fran and Gil explained the reasons for their selections to me, but all of them are looking at me like they’re overwhelmed with emotion. Some of them are even making the same face that Gil did the first time I praised him.\n\n\n I’m suddenly deeply aware of how blessed I am to have the family I do. Memories of how tremendously they praised me whenever I was able to do even just a little bit more than before float through my head.\n\n\n Just like how my family did for me, I think that as the director I’m going to need to look hard for everyone’s strong points and make sure to praise them for it.\n\n\n “Please continue to keep up the good work. Now, please, enjoy your food.”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next afternoon, we hold a cooking class, teaching everyone how to make soup. Everyone’s been split into groups again—the vegetable-washing group, the vegetable chopping group, and the group in charge of filling up the pots and tending the fires—and are learning under the tutelage of Tuuli and Ella. Hugo is back in the kitchen, working hard by himself to make dinner.\n\n\n Professors Ella and Tuuli are teaching everyone how to chop vegetables. Those of the priests who have enough strength use kitchen knives, and those apprentices who aren’t strong enough yet use smaller paring knives. Since this soup is going to be a reward as part of tonight’s dinner, everyone is working in earnest. Even while marveling over the meat and vegetables that they’ve never seen in their raw forms before, they’re doing their best to wash and chop the vegetables, despite how unfamiliar the motions are.\n\n\n I quietly observe how the first batch of cooking that Ma?ne’s Workshop has ever done is going. Fran has instructed me that, as a blue-robed priestess, it’s okay for me to be here as long as all I’m doing is watching. Under no circumstances am I allowed to help.\n\n\n I vaguely feel like there’s someone’s eyes on me. When I turn to look, I see that the boy who hadn’t eaten yesterday keeps glancing over at me as he makes sure to take the initiative as he works. I’m pleased to see him so fiercely asserting himself, so when I give out slices of fruit as a reward, I make sure he gets a slightly bigger piece.\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. This is another line from the New Testament."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The orphanage is off to a great start.\n\n\n Ever since the cooking class, they’ve been making a whole lot of soup, and as they’ve been getting more and more used to the process, they’re gradually getting faster at it, and their knife technique is improving, too. Every once in a while, one of the children tries to add in some weird ingredients, but the other kids all immediately jump in to stop them, which is pretty funny to see.\n\n\n I think everyone’s starting to seem calmer these days, maybe because their bellies are fuller than they were before.\n\n\n By now, they’ve gotten settled into a new daily routine: in the mornings, they do their work in the temple, and in the afternoons, they clean the orphanage and make soup. Luckily, in a few days, Tuuli’s day off will line up exactly with my father’s. Benno has just gotten back from the trip to another town that he’s been on for the past several days, so I head over to talk to him and ask him to lend Lutz to me.\n\n\n “Mister Benno! Please lend me Lutz in a few days!”\n\n\n “Sure, but you’re mine the day after that.”\n\n\n “…What’s that disturbing look in your eyes?”\n\n\n “Entirely your imagination.”\n\n\n …It most certainly is not.\n\n\n His even stare puts me a little on guard, but since I nevertheless got permission to borrow Lutz, my next step is to get Tuuli and my father on board.\n\n\n “Could you please take the kids from the orphanage to the forest?” I ask them. “Dad, if you’re with them, then nobody’s going to ask any questions when a whole bunch of kids that nobody’s ever seen try to go through the gates, right?”\n\n\n “…I don’t mind, but are you sure it’s okay for the orphans to go outside?”\n\n\n “I already got permission from the head priest, so it’s okay!”\n\n\n He doesn’t look like he understands why I managed to get that permission, but since I did, he agrees to go along with it. Tuuli says she already planned to go to the forest anyway, so she doesn’t mind either.\n\n\n “I’ll take them with me,” she says, “but what are you going to have them do?”\n\n\n “I’m going to ask Lutz to teach them how to make paper, but I’d like them to learn how to go foraging, too. They’ve never been to the forest before.”\n\n\n Tuuli, after spending time with the orphans teaching them how to make soup, already knows that the orphans live in a world where the common sense doesn’t line up at all with ours. She had to teach them how to use both regular knives and kitchen knives from scratch.\n\n\n She frowns. “If this is the first time they’re going to the forest, wouldn’t it be better to have more people come along to lead them?”\n\n\n “Yeah, you’re probably right, but since we’re going to be showing off how to make paper, I want to keep this in the family if I can.”\n\n\n “Okay! Got it. I’ll help you out.”\n\n\n “Woohoo! Thank you, Tuuli!”\n\n\n And so they agreed to lead the orphans of pre-baptismal or apprentice age to the forest. The adult priests want to go as well, but this time I need them to hold down the fort and take care of work at the temple. The kids need to head out first thing in the morning; otherwise, they won’t have enough time to work on making paper.\n\n\n In addition to baskets, knives, and hatchet-like blades for cutting trees, they’re bringing along pots and steamers. Lutz will teach them how to make paper the way the two of us used to do before our baptism: harvesting folin wood, steaming it, and stripping the bark. While the wood is steaming, Tuuli and my father will teach them how to forage.\n\n\n However, we want to avoid giving the orphans too much information, since there’s a chance that it might leak out. We’ll teach them how to recognize the wood we’re using, but not its name, and for now we won’t tell them anything about the ash or the binding agent we’re using. I’m not scared that someone might end up copying our product. No, what I’m scared of is the possibility that someone might try to sell it, and get caught up in the magical contract we have.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne,” says Lutz, “I’m going to make sure I learn absolutely everything!”\n\n\n “Make sure you pay attention to both the paper-making and the foraging,” I tell him.\n\n\n Gil’s eyes sparkle as he takes off for the forest, leaving me behind, stuck in the temple. I go with Fran to see the head priest, where I work diligently through the pile of paperwork, then have prayer after prayer crammed into my head while the head priest endlessly critiques the finest possibly details of my footwork and finger positions.\n\n\n From the outside, this looks like a peaceful, ordinary day, but in my head a tornado is spiraling out of control. No, maybe it’s not a tornado. It’s my financial situation.\n\n\n Outfitting my room, my kitchen, and the orphanage took a lot of money. It was an enormous drain on my finances. I have no idea what kind of noble things I’m going to be obligated to spend money on in the future, and no idea just how much that’s going to wind up costing, so I really want to figure out if I can secure a source of income.\n\n\n “I’ve already sold the hangers, and the cooking’ll take a little longer… man, it would be good if the restaurant could open, at least… do I have anything, huh? Was there anything I talked about with Lutz before that I could commodify, maybe? Hmmm…”\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne,” says Fran, “it would seem you have been brooding over something for some time now, have you not?”\n\n\n “Just, raising money…”\n\n\n Since it’s about time for the children to return from their first ever trip to the forest, we head towards the temple entrance in order to welcome them back. Through the gate, I hear the sound of children talking happily growing closer, and shortly afterward a crowd of kids comes stampeding in.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne! We’re back!”\n\n\n “Welcome back, everyone,” I say. “Did you perhaps gather a lot?”\n\n\n “We brought back tons of bark,” says one orphan.\n\n\n “I got the most!” says another.\n\n\n “I see,” I reply. “Very good! Now, perhaps we should take it all down to the workshop to dry. Lutz, if you would?”\n\n\n “Sure thing!” he replies.\n\n\n Down in the workshop, Lutz hangs up the bark up to dry, my father goes over the fine points of how to take care of a knife, and Tuuli teaches everyone how to eat all the things they brought back.\n\n\n “Now then, everyone,” I say, “let’s show our thanks to your teachers for all of the things they’ve taught you today.”\n\n\n My intention, at least, was to have everybody say “thank you very much!” and wrap things neatly up from there, but this is the temple. Instead, they all drop to their hands and knees, bowing deeply as they yell “we give thanks to our teachers!”\n\n\n My father and Tuuli pull back in shock.\n\n\n “…Umm, this is how they show thanks at the temple, so, they’re as grateful to you as they are to the gods, so…”\n\n\n “Yeah, I figured,” says my father. “I figured, but… it surprised me.”\n\n\n After I quietly try to explain things to the two of them, the children, having finished expressing their gratitude, start heading back towards their dorms.\n\n\n “The priests who stayed here are making soup for you now,” I tell them as they shuffle out. “Make sure you wash your hands before dinner. Also, please make sure to bathe yourselves before you go to sleep tonight. Today was very hot, so you must be quite sweaty, aren’t you?”\n\n\n “Yes, Sister!” they chorus, shuffling into their dorms.\n\n\n After I see them off, I let out an enormous sigh.\n\n\n “Sorry, everyone. Could you wait here, please? I need to go get changed too.”\n\n\n Fran and I head back to my room, and Delia helps me change out of my clothes. On days when I plan to stop by Benno’s shop, I come to the temple wearing my apprentice’s clothes, so only my blue robe needs to be taken off, but today I came wearing my street clothes to match Tuuli and the others who went to the forest, so I need to take off the blouse with its fluttering sleeves and get everything changed.\n\n\n “You need to have a few more blue robes made for you to wear around the temple,” complains Delia. “Your robes get all dusty after going down to the basement. I want to wash them, so please get a spare.”\n\n\n These robes are made from a very high quality, silk-like cloth. If they have to be tailored, too, then this is no doubt going to be extremely expensive. It seems like I absolutely have to get serious about raising some money.\n\n\n “Thanks for waiting!”\n\n\n Freshly changed, I head back down to the workshop. We lock everything up, I hand the key to Fran for safekeeping, and everyone starts heading home.\n\n\n “Master Lutz,” says Fran, carrying a wooden tablet, “here is today’s report on Sister Ma?ne’s activities.”\n\n\n He reads off his report, detailing what I’d done during the day and how my physical condition was holding up. As I watch him, a thought suddenly occurs to me. He has to give a report every time I come here, but since it’s hard to take out a pen and open a bottle of ink when we’re outside, if anything were to happen then he couldn’t jot it down.\n\n\n …Hm, if I made something like that, wouldn’t it be pretty useful?\n\n\n Paper is still very expensive, so memo pads aren’t a popular idea. I think there’ll probably be a demand for these, though. There’s a chance that something like this already exists on the market, but at least it’ll be a perfect present for Fran and Lutz.\n\n\n My father picks me up, and we head off. I’m so lost in pondering how to make these things and what kinds of materials I’d use that we reach the central plaza before I even know it.\n\n\n “Lutz, Lutz!” I say, calling down to him as he walks alongside Tuuli.\n\n\n “What’s up?”\n\n\n “Mister Benno has contacts with a metalworking workshop, right?”\n\n\n “He… does, but… have you come up with something?”\n\n\n “Yeah! But I want to ask Ralph and Zeke to do some woodworking, first.”\n\n\n No matter how good Lutz is with his hands, his woodworking skills are no match for Ralph and Zeke, professional tradesmen who work at a woodworking workshop. I learned that very well after having them help me out with the hangers. Besides, what I want made this time is going to be a present for Lutz, so I think it would be better if he didn’t have to make it himself. I should ask Ralph or Zeke.\n\n\n “What,” says my father, sounding hurt, “you’re not going to ask your dad?”\n\n\n “You worked really hard for me already today! So it’s okay.”\n\n\n “I can do a little more, you know?”\n\n\n “Really? You’re not going to have a drink and go to bed?”\n\n\n I look up at him, pouting a little. Since he already spent the day leading novices around the forest, I’m pretty sure he’s on course for heading home, drinking some booze, and passing right out.\n\n\n “…It’ll be fine.”\n\n\n “Can’t trust you when you say that,” chimes Tuuli, echoing the words in my heart. “You’re definitely just gonna drink and go to sleep.”\n\n\n My father pouts sullenly over having been called out.\n\n\n “Going to Lutz’s house right now isn’t great either,” I say, “so as long as you promise to do it before you drink you can do it.”\n\n\n “I’ll have my drink later, so it’ll be fine, alright? Good grief, you two are just like your mother.”\n\n\n “…But they’re so cute you just can’t help it, right Mister Gunther?” laughs Lutz, shrugging. “At least that’s what you keep telling me.”\n\n\n I ask my father to measure Lutz’s hand, and then we head home.\n\n\n “So, what am I making?”\n\n\n After returning home, my father endures a dinner without a drink, then heads into the storeroom and starts rummaging around, looking for some suitable wood and getting out his tools.\n\n\n “So, question,” I say. “Which would be easier: taking a thick, rectangular plank and gouging out the middle, or taking a thinner board and nailing on a tall border around it? Either way, I’m going to be pouring wax into the hole.”\n\n\n “Hmm, I think adding a border would be simpler, wouldn’t it?”\n\n\n “The wax isn’t going to leak out?”\n\n\n “Depends on how you do it, but I think it should be fine.”\n\n\n Since he’s taking over for me, I set about rummaging through the wood pile, looking for pieces of the right size.\n\n\n “So, I’d like you to make some boards about this thick. Could I get two about the size of my hand, two about as big as Lutz’s, and two as big as yours?”\n\n\n “How tall do you want the border?”\n\n\n “About as thick as my finger, going all the way around the board so that the wax won’t spill out… Oh, and I’m going to want holes along one side so that I could tie a string or loop a ring through, so could you please drill holes, too? Like this,” I say, sketching out a diagram on my slate as I explain.\n\n\n My father nods, stroking his stubbled chin, then gets started. While he works, Tuuli and I bathe each other. Since the hottest days of summer are getting closer and closer, I got pretty sweaty even just doing paperwork all day, and Tuuli wants to wash off all the dirt she’s covered in after spending all day in the forest.\n\n\n “So, Ma?ne,” she says, “what’re you making?”\n\n\n She scoops some water from the washbasin, which I’d added some of our handmade rinsham to, over my head, and starts working it into my hair. I relish the feeling of the scalp massage as I answer her question.\n\n\n “A memo pad.”\n\n\n “So, you mean a different kind of memo pad than the one you tried making out of the messed-up paper you brought home, right?”\n\n\n “Yeah,” I say, smirking, “but at some point I really want to try using some good paper for one of those.”\n\n\n I wipe down my entire body and dry off my hair. When I’m done with that, I swap places with Tuuli, and take my turn washing her hair.\n\n\n “It’s really called something like a ‘writing board’ or a 'tablet book’ or a 'diptych’, but you can think of it like something that you can take notes on that’s hard to erase, unlike a slate.”1\n\n\n “So why do you want Mister Benno to take you to a metalworker?”\n\n\n “I want them to make me 'styluses’.”\n\n\n ***\n\n\n The next day, I put the boards that my father made for me in my tote bag, which I have Lutz carry for me, and the two of us set off for Benno’s shop like we always do. Since I got to borrow Lutz yesterday, I promised to hand myself over for a day in return, so this is perfect timing.\n\n\n “Good morning, Mister Benno,” I say. “Could you please tell me where I could find a store that sells wax, and also a metalworker?”\n\n\n “What are you scheming this this time?”\n\n\n “Saying 'scheming’ makes me sound so untrustworthy… I’ve got an idea for presents that I’d like to make for Lutz and Fran, but I can’t make them myself, so I’d like to be introduced to workshops that can do it for me.”\n\n\n “…For me?” says Lutz, looking down at my tote bag, frowning at the boards packed into it.\n\n\n “That’s right! It’s a thank-you gift for all the hard work you and Fran have been doing for me.”\n\n\n “What about Gil?”\n\n\n “He can’t write yet, so I think it’ll be better for him and Delia to get slates, instead.”\n\n\n “Ahh…”\n\n\n As a delighted smile spreads across Lutz’s face, Benno’s mouth tightens into a frown.\n\n\n “Hey. You’re not getting anything for me?”\n\n\n “I think that when you see the finished product, you’re absolutely going to want one, but I think yours should be made professionally, at a woodworking shop. I don’t think something made by an amateur would suit you.”\n\n\n Benno is the proprietor of a major store who has surrounded himself with high-quality goods of all sort, so him holding a handmade diptych would feel entirely out of place. It would be okay as a thank-you present, but I for one wouldn’t want to use it if it wasn’t made by an expert craftsman.\n\n\n “A wax store and a metalworker? Alright, let’s go.”\n\n\n He first takes me to a store that makes and sells candles, where I ask them to fill the reservoirs in the center of each board with wax. I watch over the counter as the man lines up the six boards my father made for me, then pours goopy melted wax into each of them. It doesn’t take much time at all. Waiting for the wax to harden enough to carry takes much longer.\n\n\n “This is simple enough to do,” says the wax seller, as we wait, “but this is a strange project you’ve got here. What are you making?”\n\n\n “Umm, I’m making 'diptychs’.”\n\n\n “What’re those?” he says, skeptically.\n\n\n I try to explain, but he doesn’t quite seem to get it. This isn’t really unexpected; since it’s not the kind of thing that someone who didn’t have to do any writing outside would find useful. Now that I think of it, there’s a chance that these diptychs might not actually be a good product to sell.\n\n\n …I might need to come up with some other ideas.\n\n\n After waiting for the wax to harden enough to carry, we head to the metalworker’s workshop. I marvel about how easy it is to get my hands on what I want, this time. I can really see how having assets and connections is super important. This is vastly different from all of the trial and error I did at home right after becoming Ma?ne.\n\n\n We arrive at a workshop along the craftsmens’ road, and Benno opens the door.\n\n\n “Is the foreman in?” he calls inside. “I’m Benno, from the Gilberta Company.”\n\n\n A blast of hot air, hotter than even the heat of the summer day, roils out of the open door. Since this is, after all, a metalworking shop, it’s only natural that they’re using fire, but the sheer intensity of it startles me.\n\n\n When I excitedly peek in, trying to see just what kind of work they do, I see that the hottest part of the workshop itself is tightly closed up behind another door. There’s an apprentice here who looks like he’s stuck watching the storefront, a counter that looks like it also serves like a table for taking orders at, a few simple wooden stools, and not much else.\n\n\n As I look around the storefront that has no products to be seen, a heavily-built man comes out from deeper inside. Both of his arms are wider around than my waist, and the thickness of his beard is matched only by the thinness of his hair. His large, staring eyes are a little scary.\n\n\n “Hey there, Benno. What’re you looking for? More buttons for the nobility?”\n\n\n “No buttons this time,” Benno replies. “Listen to what this kid’s looking for.”\n\n\n “This tiny little girl? Alright, lay it on me.”\n\n\n “Uh, umm! F, first, I’d like some circular rings to tie two boards together, something like this.”\n\n\n On my slate, I sketch out a diagram of how the rings should connect the two boards together.\n\n\n “That’s easy,” he replies.\n\n\n “And then, I’d also like some 'styluses’, too.”\n\n\n “A 'style-us’?” he repeats, uncertainly.\n\n\n “Like this.”\n\n\n I erase the picture I’d drawn of the diptych and start drawing the stylus I’d like him to make. One end is tapered like a mechanical pencil for scratching words into the wax, and one end is flat like a spatula for erasing them. If possible, I’d like for there to be a clip on it as well so that it can be attached to the binding rings as well.\n\n\n “I’d like three of these, please.”\n\n\n “What’re those?” he says, skeptically, tilting his head. “That’ll take some real precise work. …Hey, Johann, got an order for you!” he yells over his shoulder, calling for someone beyond the closed workshop door.\n\n\n Shortly thereafter, a teenaged boy with frizzy, bright orange hair comes out. He looks like he’s somewhere between fourteen and sixteen years old.\n\n\n “This is my apprentice, Johann,” says the foreman. “He may still be an apprentice, but he does some very precise work. His skills are fully-fledged.”\n\n\n I show him my slate and give him the same explanation I did to the foreman. Johann takes out a wooden board and starts drawing something like a blueprint. It’s far more exact than my scribbles. As expected of a craftsman.\n\n\n “How fine of a point do you need on the tip?”\n\n\n “Please sharpen it to about as sharp as a sewing needle. That might be hard to hold, though; could you please make the part we’ll hold it at about as thick as a pen—”\n\n\n “That’s not very exact,” he interjects.\n\n\n Johann sighs, putting down his pen, then disappears back into the workshop. He returns momentarily, carrying with him a series of rods of different thicknesses. He lays them out on the counter, motioning for me to try holding each of them.\n\n\n “Which of these is easiest to hold?” he asks.\n\n\n “Umm, this is the easiest for me. How about for you, Lutz?”\n\n\n “If I’m using it like a pen, then this one fits my hand perfectly.”\n\n\n Since my hand and Lutz’s are different sizes, the thickness and weight of our styluses will need to be different if we want them to be easy to hold.\n\n\n I look up at Benno. “Could you please pick out one for Fran?”\n\n\n “…This one,” he says, after a moment. “Make two of these, one for me as well.”\n\n\n “Huh? But, even if you have your 'stylus’, if you don’t have a 'diptych’ you won’t be able to use it?”\n\n\n “It’s fine, since I’ll be having one of those made. Metalworking takes a lot of time, so it’s better to order in advance.”\n\n\n I nod at him, then turn to Johann. “Four of them, then, please!” I say, with a big nod.\n\n\n “Understood,” he says. “Now, could you describe this flat part? What will it be used for? How wide would you like it? What angle should this part be at? What is this 'clip’ here? Ah, you’d like it to clip to the rings? In that case, it needs to match the thickness of the rings, doesn’t it? How long would you like it to be?”\n\n\n The questions come one after the other, but with how obsessive he’s being, I’m pretty sure he’ll understand exactly what I’m looking for. I happily answer every question he asks.\n\n\n Meanwhile, the foreman talks to Benno about Johann. He’s got the temperament of a true artisan, obsessing over the finest details. His work is flawless, but it’s this part that he’s very slow at. It sounds like he gets depressed when clients tell him he’s asking too many questions, which happens often. He’s happiest when someone like me comes along and gives him as precise an order as he needs, but it seems like there aren’t that many people like that out there.\n\n\n “If he’d be a little more compromising,” says the foreman, “he’d have a much easier life. Him being uncompromising, though, means he can do some great things. What he really wants is a patron that’ll make the most of his skills, but you don’t know anyone like that, do you?”\n\n\n Benno hesitates, briefly, glancing at me.\n\n\n “Nah, that girl’s way too young,” says the foreman. “Hard to be a patron when you’re not grown up and can’t spend your money freely.”\n\n\n “…You’re right,” he says.\n\n\n He abruptly cuts off the conversation there, so I hold my tongue.\n\n\n …Even though I’m technically the head of a workshop, I really don’t have any money that I can use freely, after all. I like how precise he is, although I haven’t seen the finished product yet, but when I’m looking for metalworking in the future I think I’d be happy to patronize his services. Yep.\n\n\n “Hey. Ma?ne,” says Benno. “Stop just staring into space. If you’re done with your order, we’re heading to a woodworker’s next.”\n\n\n He suddenly picks me up, and quickly strides out of the metalworking workshop.\n\n\n It seems like he’s full of excitement about getting his own diptych made.\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. A diptych is two boards fastened together so that they can open and close like a book. Historically, diptychs with wax inner surfaces were used as notebooks."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n We leave the metalworking workshop and go to a woodworker’s. They’re both along the craftsmen’s road, so they’re pretty close to each other. After walking past about three other workshops, Benno pushes open a door carved with a design of a pair of saws crossed before a large tree, then enters, carrying me along.\n\n\n “I’m Benno from the Gilberta Company,” he calls out, “is the foreman in?”\n\n\n “I’m sorry, sir,” says a young apprentice, “but he’s not here at the moment… wait, Ma?ne?!”\n\n\n “Oh, Zeke!” I say. “Is this where you work?”\n\n\n There’s a familiar face here: Zeke, Lutz’s second-oldest brother. He looks up, seeing me being carried in Benno’s arms, and when our eyes meet, his jaw drops to the floor.\n\n\n “…Do you know him?” asks Benno.\n\n\n “He’s Lutz’s older brother,” I reply.\n\n\n Benno sets me down, and only then does Lutz enter Zeke’s field of view as well. I hear him mutter “…that’s Lutz, then?” to himself.\n\n\n Since Lutz goes to change his clothes at the room he’s borrowing at the Gilberta Company, this must be the first time that Zeke has ever seen him wearing his apprentice’s clothing and with his hair neatly groomed. When Lutz is at work, he looks nothing like how he does when he’s in his street clothes with his basket on his back as he gets ready to go to the forest.\n\n\n “Huh, Lutz’s brother?” remarks Benno mildly. He looks over at Zeke. “I’d like to place an order, is that alright?”\n\n\n “Co… could you wait a bit? I’ll call the assistant.”\n\n\n Zeke hurries off deeper into the store, flustered. Shortly thereafter, a leanly-built man comes out.\n\n\n “Hey there, Mister Benno,” says the man. “Welcome. What do you want made this time?”\n\n\n “Lutz?” prompts Benno.\n\n\n “Yes, sir,” says Lutz. “This, please.”\n\n\n He pulls out the diptych that had been made for Fran and sets it on the table. Benno points at it, describing his order.\n\n\n “I want you to make boards for one of these, at the same size as this one. On the front, I’d like you to carve my store’s crest, and on the back I’d like my name engraved as well.”\n\n\n The assistant produces a tape measure and takes various measurements, jotting them down on a wooden board as he does so. While he discusses the details—what kind of wood to use, the appearance of the crest, the spelling of his name, the style of lettering, and so on—with Benno, Zeke comes back out, perhaps out of curiosity over Lutz.\n\n\n “Hey Zeke,” I say, “can I order something, too?”\n\n\n “You want something? …Sure, I guess?”\n\n\n “I want a bunch of thin, hard boards. They need to all be exactly the same size, about this big…”\n\n\n When I indicate that it should be about as big as my hand, Zeke hurriedly goes to grab a tape measure. We figure out exactly how tall and wide they should be, as well as how thick.\n\n\n “Please make seventy of them,” I say.\n\n\n “Seventy?! What do you need seventy for?”\n\n\n “Heh heh heh~, I’m making ‘karuta’ for the thirty-five basic letters,” I reply.1\n\n\n Gil and Delia, my apprentice attendants, can’t read. Since attendants are supposed to be able to help with official documents and take dictation for letters, like Fran does, being able to read and write is an essential skill.\n\n\n If I only get a present for Fran, then I can imagine that Gil is definitely going to sulk over it. When I started thinking of something that I could give him, I had the idea of coming up with a fun way for him to learn his letters. If I could make him some karuta out of wooden boards, then he’d be able to study along with the children in the orphanage. Reading and writing are things that they’ll be forced to know when they get older, so I think it would be best if they learn it in a fun way while they’re still young.\n\n\n “'Karuta’? You’re making something weird again?”\n\n\n “Yep. That’s right. When do you think you’ll be done?”\n\n\n “Hmm, it’s just cutting boards to the same size, so…”\n\n\n “It’s not just cutting. I need both the front and the back to be smooth, so you need to sand them flat.”\n\n\n “Like those hairpins?”\n\n\n I nod vigorously, and Zeke scratches his head. Sanding every single one of them one by one is going to take a lot of time, but cards for karuta aren’t something that should be made hastily.\n\n\n “It’ll take about ten days for the other things I’ve ordered to be finished,” I say, “so it would be great if you could get these done by then.”\n\n\n “Oh, that’s plenty of time,” he replies.\n\n\n “How does double what I paid you last time sound?”\n\n\n “You should ask the assistant about that. I don’t really get how pricing works.”\n\n\n As he says that, the assistant suddenly turns to look our way, as if he’d long since finished his discussion with Benno and had been listening in on our conversation.\n\n\n “What do you mean by 'the last time’?”\n\n\n “I had Zeke help me make hairpins as part of our winter handiwork last year,” I reply. “I paid one medium copper coin each.”\n\n\n “So, you’re offering two coins each this time, then? …If you were asking him as an individual to do it, then that would be fine, but you’re making an order at a workshop. That’s not enough.”\n\n\n Despite how broadly he’s grinning at me, I have no intention of letting him jack up the price. I know how much wood costs from when I was making paper, and I also know how much craftsmen are ordinarily paid.\n\n\n Lutz, standing next to me, looks like he feels exactly the same as I do. He looks up at the assistant, his eyes sharp.\n\n\n “Assuming, sir, that your workshop will be charging a handling fee of thirty percent, if one were to consider the prices of the wood and the labor, then I believe that what Ma?ne is proposing is a rather generous amount as it is. Please keep in mind that this is not an order for one board, but for seventy.”\n\n\n He smiles a smile that reminds me very much of Mark. It’s a smile that says You’re attempting to take advantage of what looks like an unbaptized little girl, aren’t you? The assistant frowns.\n\n\n “Lutz! What are you doing?!” yells Zeke, like he’s probably used to doing at home.\n\n\n “My job,” Lutz replies, not even looking away from the attendant.\n\n\n Just like Benno and Mark must have drilled into him, Lutz confidently negotiates with the assistant. It’s really apparent just how much he’s grown since last year, where he couldn’t read anything but the numbers on the price tags in the city market and was overjoyed to finally learn how to write his name.\n\n\n “Zeke,” I say, “Lutz is in the middle of negotiations with the assistant. You just said you don’t really get how pricing works, right?”\n\n\n When I stop him, Zeke looks restlessly between me and Lutz, a troubled expression on his face.\n\n\n “Ma?ne… but, Lutz, he…”\n\n\n “He’s been working really hard at his merchant’s apprenticeship. Just like you’ve been working really hard to learn all the skills you need to be a good craftsman, Lutz has been working really hard to learn all of the knowledge and skills he needs to be a good merchant.”\n\n\n In this world, where the only way knowledge is transferred between people is verbally, it’s exceedingly rare for anyone to succeed in a profession other than the family trade that their parents taught them about. I’d guess that, since Lutz’s family has only ever shown scorn for his desire to become a merchant, this might just be the first time any of his family has seen him at work. Zeke is wearing a complicated expression, looking like he wants to say something, but can’t figure out how.\n\n\n “Zeke, could you maybe acknowledge, even just a bit, that he’s been working hard?”\n\n\n “…”\n\n\n As a result of his negotiations with the assistant, Lutz manages to get the price down to what I’d initially suggested. Benno, who’d watched the fruits of Lutz’s studies with a wide grin, picks me up in one arm and, rustling Lutz’s hair with the other, leaves the shop.\n\n\n Over Benno’s shoulder, I see Zeke frowning harshly as we leave.\n\n\n ***\n\n\n Ten days later, both the styluses and the boards that will become my karuta are finished. Of course, the boards for Benno’s diptych that he’d ordered are done as well. Benno, in high spirits, brought his luxuriously-crafted diptych to the wax seller and had them fill it up to finish it off.\n\n\n “Now then, Ma?ne,” he says. “How do you use this?”\n\n\n After returning to the Gilberta Company, Benno excitedly takes out his diptych. Lutz looks down at his own with great interest.\n\n\n “These are something that we can use to take notes while we’re out and about. Using the stylus that’s clipped onto this ring here, you can write onto the waxy part here. Since it’s sized so that you can hold one side of it in one hand, and since it’s a solid surface, it’s way easier to write on it than paper, isn’t it? And its biggest appeal is that you don’t need someone next to you to hold an inkwell while you write.”\n\n\n Benno immediately writes his name in the center of the board that he’s holding. The stylus etches lines into the wax as it travels, leaving white traces along the surface.\n\n\n “…I see, the wax captures what you’ve written.”\n\n\n “That’s right,” I say. “And when you close it, the words won’t get erased like they do when you’re working with a slate. This is a just tool for taking notes, though, so when you get home then you need to transfer what you’ve written to paper or a board for safekeeping. After you’re done copying things down, then you use the flat part of the stylus here to smooth out the wax, letting you reuse it… probably.”\n\n\n It’s not like I’ve ever made anything like this before. I just read about it in a book. It’s something that I’d read that tax collectors used to use in the olden days so that they could take notes while still riding on their horses.\n\n\n “Even if the wax gets old and flaky, you can scrape it out and refill it with fresh wax. …Do you think that this is something we could make a product out of?”\n\n\n He runs his fingers along the carvings of the store’s crest and his name. “…It’s something that merchants or nobles, who know how to read and write, would use. Considering that level of clientele, we’d need to retain a woodworking shop that’s skilled at engraving so that we could add ornamentation to the frame like this one. But being able to write things down immediately, without needing any ink, is very convenient.”\n\n\n “Do you think it’ll sell?”\n\n\n “I think it’ll sell to merchants, but I’m not so sure about the nobility. They have attendants, after all, so they usually have pen and ink handy. …Attendants might find it useful, though.”\n\n\n “I agree. I came up with the idea when I was watching Fran. Also, if we’re going to be selling them for attendants to use, then they don’t need to be so heavily ornamented, which will keep the cost down.”\n\n\n “Alright then, I’ll buy the rights.”\n\n\n I sell off the rights to Benno in their entirety. Since there’s things like the styluses that need to be made, Ma?ne’s Workshop is currently not able to manufacture diptychs. Also, I want actual, spendable money in front of me now.\n\n\n “Incidentally, Ma?ne, what are you making with those boards?”\n\n\n He points at my bag, where the pile of boards is rattling loosely around. In this world, there’s no free bags provided as part of your purchase. If you’re buying something, you need to bring your own reusable shopping bag. When I finish making these cards, it’ll probably be a good idea for me to ask my father to make a box for them so that they’re easy to put away.\n\n\n “These will be 'karuta’,” I reply. They’re not finished yet. The next step will be for me to draw on them.“\n\n\n \"Draw on them?”\n\n\n “Half of these will be face cards, where I’ll write one of the letters of the alphabet and draw a picture of something that starts with that letter. For example…”\n\n\n I open up my own diptych. On one side, I draw a picture, and on the other side I make up a sentence about that picture on the spot. For the face card, I write a capital S and draw a picture of a stylus, and for the text card I write “Stylus. Something used to write in a diptych.”\n\n\n When I show it to Benno, he stares at me, extremely perplexed.\n\n\n “Are… you… going to draw all of these yourself?”\n\n\n “That’s my plan…?”\n\n\n I can’t leave this to someone who doesn’t know anything about karuta. I’m planning on being the one to finish up Gil’s present for him. When I proudly say so, Lutz looks very troubled.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, let someone else do it. Especially the pictures. I… have no idea what that’s supposed to be. Gil’s going to be stumped if you give it to him like that.”\n\n\n “You’re good with your letters,” adds Benno, “but your drawing skills are pretty bad.”\n\n\n Their merciless evaluation makes my breath catch in my throat. I don’t think I’m particularly terrible at drawing. At least, back in my Urano days nobody told me I was bad at it.\n\n\n “…I, I’m not bad at drawing! Sure, it’s a little bit cartoonish, so I can see where you’re coming from, but this is avant-garde! The world is going to catch up to my aesthetic in no time, so it’s fine!”\n\n\n “I have no idea what you’re saying,” says Benno, “but you should face the facts. Leave the drawings to someone else. Got it?”\n\n\n …I, I’m not bad at drawing.\n\n\n I’m not entirely convinced that what they’re saying is correct, so the next day, in my room at the temple, I ask my attendants for their opinion.\n\n\n “…That is what Master Benno had to say about it, though,” I say, finishing up my explanation.\n\n\n Delia looks at the drawing in my diptych with wide eyes. “As Master Benno says, that’s rather appalling, isn’t it? Have you not seen a painting before?”\n\n\n “She has to have seen all the ones in the hallways when she goes to the head priests office, right?” retorts Gil. “I think she’s just bad at drawing.”\n\n\n Their words pierce deeply into my heart. I turn to Fran, but he just frowns bitterly, averting his gaze a little.\n\n\n “…It is certainly a very unique style,” he says.\n\n\n The halls of worship, the gates, and the corridors of the temple are covered with religious sculptures and paintings, and the offices of blue-robed priests are filled with all sorts of works of art. My attendants, who grew up in the temple and have seen nothing but the beautiful paintings inside, are especially harsh with their critique. It seems like they won’t be satisfied unless it’s true-to-life and exquisitely detailed.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, perhaps you could entrust the paintings to Wilma?” suggests Fran. “She received some training in the basics of painting from a blue-robed priestess some time ago.”\n\n\n “Huh? Training in the basics? Attendants can do things like that too?”\n\n\n “…To serve our masters’ wishes, attendants are required to be capable of doing a good many things.”\n\n\n Fran explains that, after an orphan’s baptism, they become apprentice gray-robed priests, assisting in the subordinate work of cleaning the halls of worship and the hallways, doing the laundry, and so on. Attendants judge those apprentices on their earnestness and cleverness, and select children from among them to become apprentice attendants.\n\n\n When they’re made apprentice attendants, they move from living in the orphanage to living in the nobles’ area. While they largely continue doing the same subordinate work as before, they also have all the knowledge they’ll need to be an attendant drilled into their skulls.\n\n\n “As such,” he concludes, “while the manners and etiquette necessary to properly receive guests is necessary for all attendants to learn, each individual priest or priestess may learn vastly different things.”\n\n\n “Basically,” adds Delia, “just like there are apprentice priestesses who learn how to offer flowers, there are apprentice priests who study mathematics.”\n\n\n “Ah hah,” I say thoughtfully when they finish their explanation, then turn to Gil. In the end it’s probably best to hear what the person receiving the present has to think.\n\n\n “Gil, what do you think? Should I have Wilma do the drawings?”\n\n\n “Huh? Me? Why me?” he says.\n\n\n He looks completely mystified that I’m asking him, so I explain to him the reason why I’m giving it to him as a reward.\n\n\n “…Every day, you snuck food into the orphanage for all the little children there, didn’t you? You were the one who worked hardest for the sake of those kids, so this is your reward.”\n\n\n “A reward, huh? Hmmm…”\n\n\n After saying that, he falls silent. For some reason, though, as time passes, his face is getting steadily redder and redder until he finally grabs his head in his hands. “I can’t. I can’t say it,” he mutters. “It’s too embarrassing.” He moans and groans, walking in circles on the spot.\n\n\n I wonder, does he maybe have some kind of fun feelings towards Wilma? Or would he just be embarrassed to ask her for help? Either way, as I wait patiently for him to finish his odd deliberations, he suddenly looks up, as if he’s made some momentous decision.\n\n\n “…Either’s good! If you don’t have time to do it yourself, then you can ask Wilma. …I, I just want you to do the writing. Your handwriting, is so, pretty, that, um… aaaargh!”\n\n\n He bolts from the room, flying down the stairs, the embarrassment clearly too much for him to handle. Moments later, I hear the loud bang of a door being slammed. I’m guessing that he’s locked himself in his room and is currently trembling in embarrassment.\n\n\n “…Sister Ma?ne,” says Fran, “what will you do?”\n\n\n “Gil isn’t used to giving anyone praise. I thought it was adorable how, despite his bashfulness, he so desperately tried to praise my handwriting, so I think I shall do my very best with writing the text cards.”\n\n\n “Very well,” he replies, obviously holding back a smile, “then I shall ask Wilma for her assistance with the face cards.”\n\n\n And so, we decide that I’ll be leaving drawing the face cards to Wilma. Fran, sensing a stopping point in the conversation, turns to leave and go back to work, and I hurriedly call out to him.\n\n\n “Fran, wait a moment. This is for you.”\n\n\n “…For me?”\n\n\n I produce the diptych I had made for him. The sizes are different, since it’s scaled to fit easily in his hand, but it’s a match with mine.\n\n\n “You’re the one who has the most work, are you not? I only have one fully-fledged attendant, yet I accepted the directorship of the orphanage. Coordinating everything must be terribly difficult. You’ve been working so hard, and I am truly, truly grateful. I would like to reward your efforts.”\n\n\n I explain to him how to use the diptych. Then, when I tell him that I had the idea when I saw him having trouble at the temple gate the other day, he smiles delightedly, his eyes crinkling.\n\n\n “To have an idea and then immediately turn it into a real product… Sister Ma?ne, I shall endeavor to learn to perfectly manage your physical condition, so that I can meet your expectations.”\n\n\n “Nothing would please me more,” I reply.\n\n\n As Fran gently takes his diptych from me, I notice that Delia’s been staring enviously at it. She’s as easy to read as ever.\n\n\n “This is for you, Delia,” I say, reaching into my bag. “Though you haven’t gone to the orphanage, when Gil is not here you work hard, all by yourself, at cleaning the first floor, and when Fran isn’t here you work hard to receive my visitors, and I’d like to acknowledge that.”\n\n\n “What’s this?”\n\n\n “This is a slate and a slate pencil. Please use these to practice your writing. After all, an attendant should be able to write letters to her master’s dictation, should she not?”\n\n\n I write Delia’s name on the slate, then hand it to her. Her eyes latch intensely onto the writing. I’d thought there might be a chance that she, unlike Gil, might already know a little of the alphabet, but I now I wonder if nobody had taught her any reading at all while she was with the temple master.\n\n\n “This is your name,” I say. “It’s the first thing you should learn to be able to write. Alright?”\n\n\n After some time passes, Gil finally calms down enough to leave his room, and I hand him a slate as well. Immediately, he and Delia start competing over their studies. So, in order to make sure I’m providing the best example to learn from, I pay meticulous attention as I start to write out each of the letters on the karuta. For the text cards, I pick things that would be easy for Wilma, who’d been raised in the temple, to draw, such as passages from the scriptures or images of the gods.\n\n\n When Benno sees the finished product, with my writing and Wilma’s drawings, he wanted to buy the rights from me on the spot, but I think I want Ma?ne’s Workshop to make them, for the children’s sake. Benno, ultimately, still has a monopoly on them, but since the workshop is making them, and since I can charge a fee for having the idea, I negotiate a contract where I get thirty percent of the profits. Now, with this, as karuta starts to sell, I’ll start seeing a little bit of revenue coming in.\n\n\n I, having secured my finances, breathe a sigh of relief, thinking about things to come. I wonder, would other educational toys or other kinds of amusements sell?\n\n\n Notes for this chapter:\n\n\n 1. Karuta are Japanese playing cards. They come in all sorts of varieties, but the relevant one here is Iroha Karuta, which is a matching game where one matches a letter of the alphabet with a word starting with that letter."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Today I visited Corinna’s home to formally order a blue robe for ceremonies and one for everyday use. Since the ceremonial robe will take time, I requested them through Benno ahead of time, except the design of the embroidery, the weaving of the obi and the fee; apparently many things have to be determined in person.\n\n\n Corinna allowed me to bring the female family members as attendants today. As Corinna herself is in the midst of pregnancy, I was told to bring along an assistant for taking my measurements. Previously Benno took my measurements over my clothes, but she apparently wanted to take my measurements properly since it looks like we will be associates for a long time to come.\n\n\n With Lutz absent, I have come together with Tuuli to get things done. My mother’s health seems to be slightly bad, and although she wanted to come along, father forbade her.\n\n\n “Ceremonial, that means a very nice cloth will be used, right? It’s the first time for me to see such soft, smooth cloth.”\n\n\n Tuuli, who finished the measuring after I undressed down to my underwear, touched the cloth with sparkling eyes. It looks like there hasn’t been an order to handle such fine cloth at Tuuli’s workshop. I guess watching Corinna’s work will be a good experience for Tuuli.\n\n\n The cloth used for my ceremonial robe is the one given to me by Benno. It appears it had already been dyed blue at the dyeing workshop, where mother works, and given back to Corinna’s store. As it’s a lapis lazuli-like strong blue, it resembles the colour of my hair.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, sweety, you can put on your clothes now. Tuuli, thank you for your help. This ceremonial robe will be embroidered with decorative words expressing the scriptures’ prayers at its hemming. Once light shines on those letters, they will glitter in gold and silver, and it will be very beautiful.”\n\n\n And, a crest has been stitched right in the middle of the collar’s embroidery. The nobles decorate theirs with their respective family crests, but since I don’t have one, they have used my workshop’s crest.\n\n\n “This is Ma?ne’s crest?”\n\n\n “Yes. It’s the crest of Ma?ne’s workshop. This is a book. This is ink and this is a pen. And here’s a combination of the hair ornament’s flower and the materials for making paper. I came up with it and it was finished after Benno added in quite a bit.”\n\n\n “It’s you after all, Ma?ne. So he had to correct it after you created something weird, right?”\n\n\n “… Gah, I was only told that it’s too plain.”\n\n\n While Corinna giggles as she listened to our conversation, she gently spreads the blue cloth on a big work table. The table was fully covered by the blue cloth, which has a lustre that felt as if it was flowing, just like a wavy sea.\n\n\n “Usually you make sure that the cloth and the design of a ceremonial robe stand out by specifying the weaving and choosing the yarn. But, since we have no time now, I will use an already finished cloth, okay? I’m planning to have its shape stand out when light shines on it by using embroidery with a thread in the same colour all over, but Ma?ne, I wonder, what kind of design would you like?”\n\n\n Being told that she will weave in the design into the fabric itself, it was a kimono’s woven pattern that came into my mind, as the very first option. I wonder whether she plans to apply embroidery with a feeling similar to figured satin or silk damask.\n\n\n As I’m small, the parts, where she can use embroidery, will be few compared to an adult. Having said that, the fabric is big since the sleeves, which have plenty of elbow room, are as wide as those of a long-sleeved kimono. Although the time needed has been reduced in comparison to weaving the cloth from scratch, putting embroidery on all of it is difficult.\n\n\n “Umm, Miss Corinna. Even if you ask me that, I don’t know as I have never properly seen a ceremonial robe. However, if you are going to apply embroidery on the whole, keep it as simple as possible…”\n\n\n I ought to have seen it during my baptism, but my memories have been completely swept away by the library and the Gl○co pose. I don’t remember very well the robes worn by the blue-robed priests. If it’s the Scriptures held by the Head Priest, I do remember it, but as for his robe that appeared to be extravagant, I was completely ignorant.\n\n\n “Ma?ne! A noble’s ceremonial robe cannot be plain!”\n\n\n “Whaa! … But embroidery all over is a lot of work, so I think it would be alright to keep it slightly simple? You think so too, right Tuuli?”\n\n\n While I was soothing Tuuli, who was in a huff, with all my might, Corinna placed a hand on her own cheek while saying 「Now let’s see」.\n\n\n “It would be great if we could show extravagance with simple embroidery, just like Tuuli’s coming-out dress appeared after making a few simple adjustments, but does anything come to mind, Ma?ne?”\n\n\n Being told so by Corinna, I brood over it as I search my memory.\n\n\n Rather than embroidering the whole with small patterns, we should lower the parts that have to be embroidered by using a largish design.\n\n\n “… How about decorating it with flowers and a『Flowing Water Pattern』?”\n\n\n “Flowing Water Pattern?”*\n\n\n (Note: * Ma?ne uses 流水紋 (ryuusuimon) which depicts a pattern of water ripples on a water surface as the water flows. Corinna repeats the spoken word in katakana. By the way, if you use the kanji to search in google, you will be easily able to find many pictures of such patterns.)\n\n\n “Umm, it means inserting flowers at several places in a pattern which exudes the impression of flowing water. If you widen the space between the water ripples and place some petals in-between, it will look gorgeous even if the embroidered parts are few… That’s at least what I think.”\n\n\n I draw curves that look soft and yet flexible with a loose touch with a loose and yet flexible touch on the slate. By making the depth of the curve lines thick and thin, I depict a flowing water pattern. I try distributing petal-like small hearts and cherry blossoms consisting of five long and narrow hearts in a suitable way.\n\n\n “It would be better to think about the design of the flowers a bit more, but this water flow is nice. Ma?ne, you are my elder brother’s water goddess, aren’t you?”\n\n\n My mouth suddenly cramped due to that naming coming out of the giggling Corinna’s mouth. Even if Benno and me were to deny it, it would be impossible for us to clear the misunderstanding of those around us if Corinna, who is Benno’s younger sister, is the one asserting it.\n\n\n “… Umm, Miss Corinna. Just how far have you spread that story?”\n\n\n “Otto is the one finding it amusing and spreading it, I think?”\n\n\n … Otto, you utter fool. Get scolded by Benno!\n\n\n While eating the lunch that had been prepared by Corinna, Corinna and Tuuli began to excitedly talk about the flowers decorating the flowing water. Given that I don’t know the names of that many flowers, I have been left behind, despite being the one impacted here.\n\n\n “Lady Corinna, it looks like Master Benno wants to enter the room…”\n\n\n “Sorry for intruding during lunch, Corinna. There’s something I’d like to pass to Ma?ne. Is that fine?”\n\n\n “Yes, it’s alright. Ma?ne is done and apparently doesn’t know what to do with her free time.”\n\n\n Being beckoned by Benno, I lightly jumped off the chair and headed towards Benno.\n\n\n “Read it somewhere alone with no one else around. I will leave the rest to you. It will be a big help if you tell me in case you have a good idea.”\n\n\n “Okay…”\n\n\n Once he says that and passes a piece of paper to me, Benno raises a hand lightly and quickly goes back to the store below.\n\n\n After I check the surroundings and make sure that no one’s here, I immediately opened the four-folded piece of paper with a rustle. The paper was a list of problems Benno noted down.\n\n\n “W-Wait a moment, following a memopad of precautions and lambasting is a letter with an assignment list?”\n\n\n There are various points, starting from stupid issues like Otto being useless and out of it since Corinna got pregnant, to things related to the italian restaurant, such as its interior, menu, service and price per guest. If there’s something I can come up with that will solve these problems with the snap of a finger, I will sooner or later think of it, but there are also solutions where I don’t know whether they will be accepted in this place. Of course, it also lists problems where I have to raise the white flag.\n\n\n While pondering about a reply to Benno, I scrutinized the problems one-by-one. And then, I sharply inhale and become pale at the moment I read the last problem.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, what’s wrong?”\n\n\n How long did I stand frozen there? Tuuli came peeking at the letter that made me look gloomy and worried. I folded the letter in panic but realizing that it’s equal to a listing of figures for Tuuli, who cannot read characters, I breathe out secretly.\n\n\n “Say, what’s written on it?”\n\n\n “It’s a secret as it’s about work.”\n\n\n While deceiving Tuuli who was eager to learn of the letter’s contents, I quickly put the piece of paper that had the problem list into my bag.\n\n\n After sighing slowly, I try to ponder whether there is any solution for the last problem, but I’m not hit by inspiration readily.\n\n\n Since Benno said that taking along Lutz outside the city will happen after determining a place for the workshop, I simply swallowed that story. By no means did I perceive that as him being unable to take Lutz along because he hasn’t gotten the permission of Lutz’s father.\n\n\n Just like me, Lutz believes in Benno’s excuse. Seeing Benno returning from outside the city Lutz’s eyes gleamed with the expectation of 「I wonder whether he will decide on a location for the workshop soon?」. There’s no way I can tell that kind of Lutz something like 「You can go there even as soon as tomorrow as long as your dad gives his permission」. It would result in causing an irreparable rift in Lutz’s family.\n\n\n … I simply don’t know a good method to persuade Lutz’s father gently.\n\n\n Tuuli and Corinna wanted to use flowers of the four seasons in the embroidery, but while they were getting excited next to me whether to do it from the top to the bottom, or from the left to the right, I was at my wits’ end.\n\n\n ******\n\n\n “The Star Festival will take place soon, won’t it?”\n\n\n “Waah!? W-What?”\n\n\n Being called out by Lutz along the way to the temple, I look around me with a start. Lutz squinted his eyes slightly and peered at me. To keep a secret from Lutz, who is in charge of taking care of my health condition is a herculean task for me.\n\n\n “What’s wrong, Ma?ne? Aren’t you distracted quite a bit?”\n\n\n “I’m not! What were we talking about again?”\n\n\n Apparently having quickly seen through me being dazed, Lutz returned to the topic after sighing once.\n\n\n “Star Festival. Does it look like we can go together this year?”\n\n\n “Star Festival? … Ah, you mean the summer festival? It was about playing in water, right?”\n\n\n “No, it’s not water, it’s about throwing Tau fruits.”\n\n\n The Tau Fruit is a small red fruit seen during spring. I heard that it will swell up to a the size of a fist by storing a lot of water in summer. I have understood it as something like a naturally occurring water balloon, but I have never seen the real thing.\n\n\n “If it’s not playing in water, what kind of festival is the Star Festival?”\n\n\n I completely don’t grasp what kind of festival it is since I never participated in it. Lutz taught me, who is inclining her head to the side in confusion.\n\n\n It seems the Star Festival is actually not a festival of playing around in water, but a day of marriage ceremonies. Apparently marriage ceremonies are carried out all together once a year and it seems that throwing Tau fruits has been taking place as it’s connected to the marriage ceremonies.\n\n\n “Meaning, those unrelated to the marriage ceremonies will go together into the forest once the gate opens on the second bell and pick up Tau fruits. When the third bell chimes, the marriage ceremonies begin, and after the ceremonies finished upon the fourth bell, the brides and grooms will leave. The guests, who had gathered in the central plaza until then, will lurk in various alleys and get ready to use the Tau fruits they have.”\n\n\n Being reminded of the spectacle during the baptismal ceremony where a great number of people appeared on the main street, a picture of everybody holding water balloons in their hands popped up in my mind. That’s surreal. I don’t get the meaning.\n\n\n But, there are many events related to important ceremonial occasions that bear no meaning if seen by an outsider. Even in books I read in the past, there were certainly many various events such as guests fighting at a marriage ceremony, all invitees trespassing on the bridal night or the right of the bridal night belonging to the local lord. It’s probably best to comply with the custom while considering it as the culture of this place.\n\n\n “And then?”\n\n\n “After all the brides and grooms have entered the central plaza, the battle will start once the bell chimes. In other words, the Tau fruits will be thrown at the brides and grooms.”\n\n\n “Eh!? At the brides and grooms!?”\n\n\n “Correct. They will run to their new home while the groom is protecting his bride. You might as well say it’s a test of the man’s dependability. At that time various people along the way will throw Tau fruits at the bride and groom, and it will turn into a exhausting cycle of them running around the whole city while throwing back at their attackers and having Tau fruits thrown at them.”\n\n\n “What an amazing festival.”\n\n\n Even at the exchange of engagement gifts in Japan, there will be some mysterious goods, but there’s meaning to it, if you strain the interpretation. The Tau fruits said to be thrown at the brides and grooms might carry the meaning a prayer for children or the perpetuation of one’s descendants if it’s a fruit that has many seeds.\n\n\n “But you know, the ones who gather and throw Tau fruits with the highest zeal are definitely the adults who were unable to marry this year. Every year they aim at the brides and grooms with an unbelievable drive smoldering in their eyes. It’s funny though.”\n\n\n Yeah, I certainly understand, such murmur popped up in my head.\n\n\n Including my time as Urano, I had an extremely weak relation to things such as lovers or marriage. I can very well understand the emotions of the adults, who were unable to get married, throwing Tau fruits with all their might at the married couples, who leave the temple with smiles full of happiness.\n\n\n “… I was able to comprehend what kind of festival it is. I’m looking forward to it, Lutz.”\n\n\n “Oh, Ma?ne, you are suddenly all eager? And then, once the married couples are gone after having been chased away with the Tau fruits, various celebratory dishes will be lined up on the plaza. The children will go back home after the sun goes down, at a time when they have eaten enough of those dishes. After that, the children will be forbidden from going outside. The reason being that next it will become a festival for just the adults where alcohol will be put out.”\n\n\n As might be expected of a festival with the name of Star Festival, the most important event apparently starts at night. After the children are gone, it will apparently change into a festival of the unmarried adults, who have grandly celebrated the appearance of the married couples, searching for lovers. The ones who will be vexed the most at this point are those who were born in summer with their coming-of-age ceremony being at the end of summer, according to Lutz.\n\n\n “Umm, I wonder, do the orphanage children participate in the festival?”\n\n\n “Who knows? So far I haven’t seen them even once. … Is there something you got to do at the temple, Ma?ne? If I remember correctly, you told me that there isn’t anything until autumn, but does it look like we can go to the Star Festival together?”\n\n\n Even though I was asked by Lutz with a worried look, I was unable to answer right away. Seeing that the marriage ceremonies will take place in the temple, there might be some work for me.\n\n\n “… I don’t really know, so I will try to ask the Head Priest.”\n\n\n I enter the temple and Lutz goes back to the store. After seeing off Lutz, I changed clothes in my room, and then tried to ask Fran about the Star Festival while immediately writing a letter to request a meeting with the Head Priest.\n\n\n “Hey Fran, did you ever take part in the Star Festival?”\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, it’s not Star Festival, but the Ritual of Star Union. Isn’t the Star Union a ritual to congratulate a marriage?”\n\n\n Fran explained that it’s a ritual called Star Union and not Star Festival in the temple, and that it’s something connected to the myth of blessing the marriage between the God of Life and the Goddess of Earth by the God of Darkness, who is the supreme deity.\n\n\n As it’s originally a ceremony that was carried out at night where it was easy to obtain the God of Darkness’ divine protection, it seems that it’s actually, even now, taking place during the night in the noble district. It appears that the commoner’s ceremony ended up being carried out in the morning when the ceremonies of the commoners and nobles were separated after the number of residents in the city grew too much.\n\n\n “Though, if it’s the blessing of the God of Darkness, it seems to be best to hold it during the winter when the nights are long…”\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, it was summer when the God of Darkness gave his permission for the two gods to marry. Given that there’s the offering ritual in winter, it seems that there are no priests who can grant their blessings.”\n\n\n I lightly shook my head after reconsidering it and then nodded at Fran’s denial. Although it was me who mentioned it, there will be no marriage ceremonies in midwinter.\n\n\n “If I consider it properly, it’s difficult to hold a marriage ceremony during a blizzard. If one considers that the newly-wed family has to prepare for winter, marrying before autumn is just logical. If the wedding anniversary is the same for everyone, there probably won’t be any husbands angering their wives by mistaking the date either.”\n\n\n While saying that, I finished writing the letter.\n\n\n “Fran, can you please take this letter to the Head Priest? There are things I want to ask the Head Priest about my and the orphanage’s duties at the time of the Star Festival.”\n\n\n “As you wish.”\n\n\n In spite of me meeting the Head Priest during the filing of documents in the morning, it’s necessary to set up a meeting even for petty consultations and I have to make an appointment through letter. I’m slowly getting used to these bothersome formalities. Still, there are also very many situations where trivial questions are resolved by being written down in a letter.\n\n\n Anyway, what I was told time and time again by Fran and the Head Priest is to not carelessly chatter at a place with other people present.\n\n\n Despite me scheduling the meeting date for several days later, the Head Priest grabbed his head at the instant he scanned through the letter he was given by Fran and called me to his secret room.\n\n\n I follow him obediently, but as for a reason why he is so troubled with the letter for requesting a meeting, nothing comes to my mind.\n\n\n “Is it alright even though I have no meeting appointment?”\n\n\n “You fool. The Ritual of Star Union is tomorrow, right!? Won’t the ceremony finish before you even send out something like written invitations?”\n\n\n The eyes of the Head Priest got a sharp glint and he asked me that right after we entered the secret room. Given that the Head Priest lectures me in this room while showing anger that’s similar to him releasing cold air, even though he usually scolds me with a composed expression, it’s better to be in his normal office during the times he’s angry than here.\n\n\n “Oh, is that so? I simply thought that there’s still some more time left as I was told that it’ll be soon…”\n\n\n “I suppose it’s a topic that won’t be brought up in the temple since it’s the norm. Because the filing of documents, that had piled up until now, is progressing nicely, I ended up postponing it, but it looks like we have to focus on your education first, doesn’t it?”\n\n\n The Head Priest clearly realized that I’m not understanding the events within the temple at all. This is bad. It’s a dangerous omen.\n\n\n Having a premonition that, just as gossiped between the grey-robed priests of the orphanage, his zealous training which results in the grey-robed priests becoming first class, albeit reluctantly, once they become the Head Priest’s attendants will befall me, I secretly avert my gaze. The fed-up expression of the Head Priest was reflected at the edge of my field of vision.\n\n\n “Good grief, you are… So, to answer your question, the Ritual of Star Union is a ceremony of growing up. Since you are an apprentice, you mustn’t participate in the ceremony. Rather, as director, stand watch so that the orphans don’t leave the orphanage. There will be many people from the city entering and leaving the temple during the Ritual of Star Union. Make sure that not a single person leaves the orphanage during the ritual since it’s a ceremony where the blue-robed priests are eagerly pining for alms.”\n\n\n Being told to stay in the orphanage’s building on the day of the festival, I got flustered. As I want to participate in the Star Festival and throw Tau fruits, I really don’t want to get locked away in the orphanage.\n\n\n “Umm, I’d like to participate in the Star Festival in the lower city. Is that not allowed?”\n\n\n “The lower city’s festival?”\n\n\n The Head Priest’s eyebrows twitched slightly.\n\n\n “All of the city’s children will go to the forest to pick up Tau fruits throughout the morning. In the afternoon it will apparently turn into a festival of throwing the Tau fruits at each other.”\n\n\n “… What’s that? Just how is that related to the Star Union?”\n\n\n “I don’t quite understand. I never participated in it until now as last year I had the Devouring and the years before my physical condition wasn’t that great either. I’m looking forward to it very much as this year’s my first participation, but…”\n\n\n The Head Priest creased his wrinkles and eyebrows. It’s an expression wavering between rejection and sympathy. He wanted to tell me that it’s not allowed, but at the same time he pitied me for it being the first time I could participate.\n\n\n “… No good? Though I believe that the children of the orphanage will also be docile if I take them along, you know?”\n\n\n “The morning will be fine with that, but what will you do about the afternoon? In fact it will be a mutual throwing of Tau fruits at each other, right? It will be problematic if needless quarrels happen after taking the orphans into the city. Since the blue-robed priests will head into the noble district in the afternoon, it will turn into a situation where there are no people in charge present.”\n\n\n It seem that the blue-robed priests and their attendants will all leave the temple for the sake of the noble district’s Ritual of Star Union once the marriage ceremonies in the morning end.\n\n\n Isn’t it fine for them to play inside the temple’s grounds once there’s no one left to get angry?\n\n\n “… Umm, Head Priest, can you please permit the throwing of Tau fruits in the orphanage and temple in order to not cause troubles outside in the afternoon, once they have picked up the fruits in the forest throughout the morning? Since it’s a rare occasion, I’d like to have the children experience the festival as well. Given that it’s the first time for me as well, I have been looking forward to it very much…”\n\n\n After slighly casting down his eyes and pondering about it for a while, the Head Priest slowly lifted his line of sight and said,\n\n\n “Very well. You will have to clear it away properly. Also, I won’t mind as long as you don’t cause an uproar to the degree of worrying the city’s residents.”\n\n\n “Thank you very much.”\n\n\n *****\n\n\n Starting from afternoon, there’s immediately a preparatory meeting at the orphanage. As it will be fine as long they are not discovered by the blue-robed priests, they will wait for my and Lutz’s arrival after having finished the cleaning of the prayer room in the early morning and having changed into their attires for going to the forest. We will sneak out secretly and go to pick up the Tau fruits in the forest. The orphans, who are doomed to be always locked up in the orphanage, are very elated.\n\n\n “I will be a sentry on that day.”\n\n\n “I will prepare the carriages.”\n\n\n The grey-robed priests won’t be able to pick up the Tau fruits in the forest as they have various tasks such as participating in the ritual, having to prepare the blue-robed priests’ departing to the noble’s district, and standing guard as sentries. They are watching the frolicking children while looking jealous.\n\n\n “However, any duties will be done once the ceremonies end, right? As for the throwing of Tau fruits, let’s start the throwing battle once everyone finished their task after the blue-robed priests and their attendants have left towards the noble’s district. It’s something that’s more fun with everyone joining in. We will patiently wait until all the priests have finished their duties, okay?”\n\n\n Once I asked the children, they nodded deeply.\n\n\n “Yeah, we will wait!”\n\n\n “I will pick up the share of those who cannot come due to their duties.”\n\n\n I had the grey-robed priests, who are on duty, compromise by preparing dinner and having the children endure. What to say, it seems they went without dinner on the day of the Star Union’s ritual since the blue-robed priests were all out.\n\n\n “I will ask my cooks and have them make plenty of food.”\n\n\n After returning to my room, I requested Hugo and Ella, through Fran, that I’d like them to finish their business, to prepare dinner, on the day of the Star Union until the fourth bell.\n\n\n As it seems that Hugo is an adult, who hasn’t been able to marry, he’s burning with the ambition to participate in the festival. I heard from Fran that he’s eager to have his work finished as fast as possible.\n\n\n Although he would be unable to throw Tau fruits at the married couples, it would be fine as long as he could please the children of the orphanage, right?"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n On the day of the Star Festival.\n\n\n In the early morning when the sun still doesn’t let one experience the heat of summer, albeit having already risen, the town was already enveloped in the usual commotion for a festival as the people were bustling about. Even if it was still a while before the gates open, a stream of people were heading towards the south and east gates.\n\n\n “I’m off, Mom.”\n\n\n “Ma?ne, pay attention so you don’t play around too much. Lutz, I’m sorry, but as usual I’ll leave Ma?ne to you.”\n\n\n I leave home together with Lutz who came to pick me up. Tuuli starts off together with us, but since it seems Tuuli is going to enjoy the festival with her friends, we will part ways. She runs off towards the gate, together with Ralph and Fey.\n\n\n “Have fun today, Ma?ne.”\n\n\n “You too, Tuuli.”\n\n\n Running off while holding hands, Ralph and Tuuli part ways with us, while Lutz and I head to the temple, going against the flow of people. Today I’m wearing casual clothes so that I can enjoy this watery festival.\n\n\n People appear in small groups from the alleys here and there as they walk towards the gates with their cheerfully sparkling eyes. As everyone assumes that they will get wet, not a single person is wearing fine clothes, despite it being a festival.\n\n\n We press through the opposing waves of people in the central plaza, and then head even further north. Thereupon the pedestrian traffic slowly diminishes. Those who plan to go into the forest right when the gates open have already gathered together near the gates themselves.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, please stay back in the orphanage, okay?”\n\n\n “Eh? Why!?”\n\n\n I had planned to go to the forest to pick up Tau fruit together with everyone, which is why I looked up at Lutz in confusion. Lutz opens his mouth and I can tell by his expression that he is having difficulty finding a good way to say it.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, if it had only been us going to the festival, we could have returned after picking up two or three Tau fruit from the forest. However, instead everyone will be throwing them at each other later at the orphanage, and we’re not throwing Tau fruit only at the newly-wed couples, right? Because of that we need more Tau fruit – a lot more. If I took you along Ma?ne, we wouldn’t be able to return to the temple until after the fourth bell chimes.”\n\n\n Having intended to go into the forest on an excursion together with everyone, I hang my head due to Lutz’ reasonable argument. As usual, I hate myself for becoming nothing more than a burden.\n\n\n While gently patting my head to comfort me, Lutz lowers his voice slightly.\n\n\n “Besides, you know, there might be people coming to see how things are going at the orphanage. Isn’t it best if you, the director, remain there?”\n\n\n “Uh… that’s true.”\n\n\n The probability that the Head Priest or the Temple Master’s attendants might come to warn me or to check on things is high. If the Temple Master learned that the orphanage was completely vacant, he might not blame only me, but also blame the Head Priest who had given his permission.\n\n\n “… Got it, I will stay back.”\n\n\n We arrived at the temple almost the same time as the second bell chimed. It’s now time for the gates to open.\n\n\n ◇◆◇◆\n\n\n Together with Fran, I watch everyone being led off by Lutz. They snuck out through the orphanage’s backdoor, the children holding their hands over their mouths so that they won’t chatter. It can’t be helped – the gatekeeper struggles to keep a straight face when he sees the children, and when the kids see him they can’t help but start giggling. Hopefully this will keep the kids quiet, at least until they are clear of the orphanage.\n\n\n Having seen everybody who left the temple starting to run towards the gate while raising their voices, I go back to my own room while harboring feelings of jealousy. There I change into my blue robe, in order to officially be on duty in the orphanage.\n\n\n “Delia, are you fine with not going to the forest?”\n\n\n “Foraging in the forest is not something I need to learn to become a mistress. Rather than that, I’d like to memorize these characters quickly.”\n\n\n Gil and Delia are practising their penmanship while competing to be the first to fill the slates I gave them with a perfect alphabet. Gil seems to be memorizing them slightly faster. I think that’s probably because he has taken karuta to the orphanage to play it with everyone.\n\n\n “Gil is beating you, isn’t he?”\n\n\n “Ugh~! Isn’t it by just a tiny bit!? I’ll pass him soon!”\n\n\n Leaving the monitoring of the cooks to Delia, who is staying behind voluntarily, I decide to go to the orphanage together with Fran.\n\n\n When we descend to the first floor, I fleetingly glance through the open door at Hugo and Ella, who are cooking with a terrifying vigor to prepare the meals before the fourth bell, when the Tau fruit will be thrown.\n\n\n “I have been ordered by the Head Priest to explain to you the rituals in the temple this morning.” With a more serious tone, Fran continues, “Sister Ma?ne, he also said that until you memorize them properly, you will be banned from holding the Tau fruit throwing event in the orphanage.”\n\n\n “Uwaah…”\n\n\n The Head Priest, who apparently doesn’t tolerate even the slightest compromise in regards to education, seems to have immediately set up an education program for me. Although I have to memorize it before day’s end, there is quite a bit of material to cover.\n\n\n “The Head Priest has assigned this to you after judging how much you will be able to handle based on your calculation and literacy abilities”, Fran says. I feel dejected after seeing the content details written on a wooden tag, but the Head Priest misunderstands. My calculation ability is a gift from my previous life, and my literacy ability is something I strived to achieve because it’s an essential ability for reading. I will be in trouble if he uses that as a basis for the amount of material about the temple’s rituals I can quickly memorize! I’m not actually all that smart.\n\n\n As I was heading towards the orphanage and passing a hallway, I suddenly faced a blue-robed priest, one whose face I have never before seen. Apparently this priest is going to prepare the ritual.\n\n\n “Oh? Aren’t you that shameless commoner clad in blue? There’s no place for children in today’s ritual, is there?”\n\n\n “My apologies Brother, but my duties today have nothing to do with the ritual. My sole responsibility, given to me by the Head Priest himself, is to ensure that no children disturb the ceremony, and I am to keep them in the orphanage.”\n\n\n “Hoo, I see. I suppose it suits a commoner to look after orphans. Be sure to do your job.”\n\n\n “I thank you kindly for your encouraging words, Brother.”\n\n\n “Hmph!”\n\n\n The blue-robed priest leaves while snorting and not looking at all amused. I begin to walk towards the orphanage, as well. Fran anxiously frowns and calls out to me while looking worried.\n\n\n “Umm, Sister Ma?ne. Just now…”\n\n\n “You don’t have to worry about it, Fran. I will be alright as long as they only use their mouths. Absolutely no real harm has been done.”\n\n\n Once I entered the orphanage, several gray-robed priestesses had remained in the orphanage. As might be expected of those having been left behind as candidates for flower offering 1, every child is of a different type, but they are all very beautiful children with well-proportioned bodies.\n\n\n “Oh my, Sister Ma?ne. Whatever could be the matter?”\n\n\n Turning around in my direction with a twirl, she bends her head slightly to one side. Her mannerisms are very refined. She looks much more like a proper lady than do I.\n\n\n “I planned to stay here as it’s around the time people often come and check on things. You are on duty, I gather?”\n\n\n “We are not, but since going to the forest hasn’t any appeal for us, we are considering whether we should stay behind and prepare the soup.”\n\n\n “Well, I would greatly appreciate that.”\n\n\n I discovered a face I recognised among the grey-robed priestesses.\n\n\n She’s a girl in her mid-teens. She neatly wore her blonde, almost bright orange, hair up. Well, seeing that she’s wearing her hair up, it might be odd to call her a girl since she’s considered a grown woman in this world. However, with her childish looks, it perfectly fits calling her a girl.\n\n\n “Wilma, thank you for doing me the favor of drawing karuta the other day. It was very beautiful work.”\n\n\n Wilma’s bright, light brown eyes which are always smiling, narrowed delightfully, making her gentle quality stand out even more.\n\n\n “No, it is I who has to thank you for allowing me to draw. It’s been a while since I last held a pen. I was very happy. The children here watched it, and were quite interested. But it wasn’t something for the sake of the orphanage, was it?”\n\n\n “Well, that’s because it was a reward for my attendants. Though it’s possible for me to order boards for the children here, if you will do me the favor of drawing the pictures, Wilma?”\n\n\n If it’s just preparing the boards and writing the characters, I can manage that well enough, but it seems my illustrations are too different from this place’s culture. So much so that all those around me actually stopped me from drawing. Wilma’s cooperation is indispensable for creating karuta.\n\n\n “Oh, by all means! I would really appreciate that.”\n\n\n Wilma’s face brightened up. While being enthusiastic about wanting to draw, she’s also overflowing with love towards the children. Back when we did the major cleanup of the orphanage, certainly Wilma was the very first to run to the children to completely wash them.\n\n\n Shortly after I promised to prepare karuta for the children of the orphanage, the girl next to Wilma cast her eyes down sadly.\n\n\n “If I was able to draw like Wilma, I would also be of use to Sister Ma?ne, but…”\n\n\n “Oh, but isn’t the lyre your strong point, Rosina?”\n\n\n It seems that Rosina, who had let out a disappointed sigh, was not only mature and beautiful, but also good at playing the lyre. What’s with that? How gracious.\n\n\n I had wanted to hear Rosina play the lyre by all means, but since the instrument was owned by her previous master, you might say that she’s currently in a situation where she has no special skill. If possible, I would like to buy one for her, but even in Japan, instruments were basically pretty expensive. There’s absolutely no doubt that the price for a good instrument would be astronomical.\n\n\n “Say, Fran. A lyre is expensive, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “It might be better to ask Master Benno about that, but is music necessary for the etiquette of a blue-robed priestess?”\n\n\n “I believe we will be able to help you, if you are going to learn about culture, Sister Ma?ne. If you don’t mind, please do us the favor and let us become your attendants.”\n\n\n Rosina seems to have previously served with Wilma under the same blue-robed priestess apprentice. It also looks like that priestess apprentice was very interested in the arts, as her attendants were clearly divided into those grey-robed priestesses and apprentices who showed promise in learning the arts, and those grey-robed priests who only did chores. I hear that Rosina and the others polished their skills in singing, musical instruments, dancing, poetry and drawing every day.\n\n\n … Ughh. I was forced to take piano lessons for around three years, but I never touched a lyre. Things like melodicas or recorders don’t exist here, do they?\n\n\n “Good day then, Sister Ma?ne, we are off to prepare the soup.”\n\n\n Once Wilma’s group left to prepare the soup, Fran and I ended up being left behind in the orphanage’s mess hall.\n\n\n “Hey Fran, if I told you that I want to take Wilma as attendant, what would you think about that? Do you think that I would get permission from the Head Priest?”\n\n\n Fran frowned a bit.\n\n\n “Wilma? Is it alright for me to inquire about the reason?”\n\n\n “Wilma is skilled at drawing, right? That’s true for karuta, but since drawing will become necessary for making the things I want to create from now on, I’d like to secure her before another blue-robed priest gets his hands on her. Besides, I wondered whether a grey-robed priestess with such a grown-up refinement won’t be needed as well.”\n\n\n “I believe that he is very likely to give you permission. However, because Wilma looks after the very young children in this orphanage the most, what will happen to the orphans after you took Wilma away…?”\n\n\n “Right. Let’s try thinking about it for a bit after asking Wilma’s opinion next time.”\n\n\n While I listen to a lecture describing the temple’s ceremonies from Fran, the third bell rings. Soon after, the air becomes filled with the sound of people talking. It appears the brides and grooms have arrived at the temple for the Ritual of the Star Union. I want to go have a look, but there’s no way I can leave.\n\n\n As I am finishing my quota while fidgeting around, the fourth bell chimes. With the Ritual of the Star Union apparently having ended, the noisy commotion gradually fades.\n\n\n Once a little bit of time has passed after silence had returned, the children secretly return through the backdoor. They climb the stairs making sure to keep the sound of their footsteps low as they hold down their mouths.\n\n\n “Welcome back, everyone. Were you able to pick plenty of Tau fruit?”\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, shhh!”\n\n\n Being told to not talk, I immediately hold my tongue. We hear the sound of the basement’s backdoor closing. Then Lutz comes in and the instant after he lowers his finger from his lips, everyone starts to chatter all at once.\n\n\n “We picked up a lot!”\n\n\n “All the baskets have been put in the basement, but lunch comes first, alright?”\n\n\n “Now wash your hands and wait for God’s blessing to arrive. I need to go back to my room for a moment.”\n\n\n Since Lutz is with me, we pass through the basement instead of the hallway. There are a great number of baskets filled with Tau fruit that everyone had gathered.\n\n\n “Lutz, can I have four of the gathered fruits? I’d like to give them to Hugo and Ella since they couldn’t go to the forest.”\n\n\n “Yeah, go for it.”\n\n\n I have Fran carry the Tau fruit, and we return to my room, going through the backdoor.\n\n\n Having already finished preparing lunch, Hugo waited while worrying about what’s happening outside the temple. I have Fran pass two Tau fruit each to both Hugo and Ella.\n\n\n “Thank you very much for coming, even though today’s the day of the festival. This is only a bit, but take it with you.”\n\n\n “Eh? Wha-!? Thank you!”\n\n\n As I turned my back on the kitchen, I sense Hugo running off. Just how much is he looking forward to the Star Festival? And, who does he plan to hit with those Tau fruit? Since Ella raised her voice to stop him with “Wait a minute, Hugo” as if worried about my opinion, I read the mood and head upstairs without turning around.\n\n\n I eat lunch together with Lutz in my own room, while having Delia serve us.\n\n\n Today’s lunch is an imitation of capellini. I had them make it with fresh pasta that was cut as thinly as possible. They experimented by preparing two types; one was garnished with herbs, and used a lightly scented cheese and tomato sauce, similar to a sauce with tomatoes and mozzarella; and the other was vegetable-based oil seasoned with the garlic-like Norilga, herbs, and salt, aiming for a basil sauce. They also prepared a salad garnished with seasonal vegetables and steamed chicken. In reality, I feel an urge to eat chilled soumen 2, but it can’t be helped since I still haven’t seen anything that seems usable in Japanese cuisine.\n\n\n “Lutz, you worked very hard, didn’t you? Eat plenty, you deserve it. Because of you, everyone looked very happy. Thank you.”\n\n\n “They searched for Tau fruit in high spirits. Some of these guys went very deep into the forest. I was worried about what I would do if they didn’t make it back in time.”\n\n\n “… How nice. I wanted to watch the festival, too. I studied throughout the whole morning with Fran.”\n\n\n It was inevitable for me to feel jealous after hearing the stories of the orphans happily picking up Tau fruit in the forest and about the people who were arming themselves with their Tau fruit while the orphans were returning to the temple.\n\n\n “Say, Ma?ne. It’s only for a bit, but how about we go watch the festival together?”\n\n\n “Eh?”\n\n\n “There are probably no grooms or brides left there anymore. It’s not like we’re going to throw Tau fruit. You know, it’s just to experience the atmosphere of the city. After we finish our lunch, there will be a bit of time once the others start their meal, right?”\n\n\n After the blue-robed priests finish their lunch and once their attendants have finished eating as well, then God’s blessing will be distributed. Since there are also some gray-robed priests working to prepare the carriages, it will take a bit of time until everyone gathers for the throwing of the Tau fruit.\n\n\n “Let me, let me!! I want to go!”\n\n\n After changing from my blue priestess garb to casual clothes, I rushed out through the temple’s gate together with Lutz.\n\n\n The flooded streets glittered in the summer sun. Close to the temple it’s mostly dry, but as we leave the temple’s vicinity, it becomes wet under our feet. I wonder just how many Tau fruit had to be thrown for the summer sun to not have dried the streets by now?\n\n\n I see children running and shouting out with joy, their whole bodies sopping wet with water dripping from their hair. Tumultuous voices are reverberating from up ahead, the target towards which the giggling children are running.\n\n\n “Let’s go, Lutz.”\n\n\n “Don’t get too close, Ma?ne.”\n\n\n Following Lutz’ advice, I try to secretly peek from within the shadows of a building. It was a large free-for-all battle in an alley that wasn’t very big. There are no allies or enemies here, it’s a battle royale as people are fervently throwing Tau fruit while loudly shouting nonsensical gibberish. As loud yells burst out in the tight space between the buildings, they echo and merge to a near deafening volume.\n\n\n All of them are drenched. Older girls in light summer dresses have clothes clinging tightly to their bodies, so it’s only natural that their figures stand out clearly. In some extreme cases, clothes are completely transparent. There are also many men running around bare chested, as if annoyed by their clingy clothes.\n\n\n … Whoaa, it looks just like the uproar when fans learn their team has won the World Series or the World Cup!\n\n\n “Gee!?”\n\n\n “Ugh!?”\n\n\n All of a sudden Lutz exclaims as water dripped from his head. I turn around in surprise as a few drops of the cold water have hit me as well, and I see several children preparing to fire Tau fruit behind Lutz.\n\n\n “Lookit here, we gots folks who ain’t wet at all!”\n\n\n The instant the child shouts, the large mob of revelers all turn this way at once. Pierced by the sparkling eyes of hunters who found their prey, I experience a fear that makes me cringe. My entire body shudders after a small scream escaped my lips.\n\n\n “We have to run for it, Ma?ne! Avoid as many as you can!”\n\n\n “Impossible.”\n\n\n I’d be shocked if you expected such smart maneuvering from me. The best I can do, at most, is defending against a direct hit to my face by raising both arms.\n\n\n Despite being stunned, I was running, Lutz leading me by the hand, as he repeatedly smacked down the Tau fruit that came flying our way with his free hand. Just like a real water balloon, the Tau fruit burst once they hit the stone paving.\n\n\n Having evaded any direct hits, I felt relieved, but the mob’s bloodlust was apparently fanned by Lutz’ avoidance.\n\n\n “He blocked it! How cheeky!”\n\n\n “Everyone, get him!”\n\n\n “Uooooooh!”\n\n\n The Tau fruit that are coming flying one after another hit me and burst open with splashing sounds. The sensation of being hit itself feels bouncy and it doesn’t hurt much even if I’m directly hit. But I’m getting goosebumps from the water that burst from the fruit which hit my back, and from the water dripping down from my head and down my spine.\n\n\n “Eek! Cold! It’s cooold!!”\n\n\n “Ma?ne, move your feet!”\n\n\n What Lutz was able to ward off was only the first wave. Since adult have joined in as well, there’s no way we will be able to escape. In the blink of an eye we have been completely surrounded and overrun.\n\n\n Unable to avoid or escape, we suffer a concentrated barrage from the crowd, a crowd that has become drunk in its enthusiasm for the festival. We are completely soaked in an instant.\n\n\n “Ahaha! Didn’t ya do good in protectin’ tha’ midget?”\n\n\n “Here’s a guy with a promising future, am I right?”\n\n\n While laughing heartily and praising Lutz for trying to protect me to the bitter end, they fled as quickly as they’d come, looking for more victims.\n\n\n “… Lutz, with this… I will definitely catch a cold, won’t I?”\n\n\n With my fingertips I gently pick up my skirt which is dripping wet as Lutz agrees, sending water drops flying with a shake of his head.\n\n\n “I guess you aren’t wrong about that. At this rate we will be thoroughly scolded by Aunt Elfa, and we might not be allowed to go to the festival a second time.”\n\n\n “… I understand the festival’s atmosphere. I grasped it reaaally well. Once it’s over I will definitely have a fever, so it’s a festival that doesn’t suit me.”\n\n\n Once I firmly wring out my hair, water trickles down making dripping sounds. While wringing out our clothes and hair, Lutz and I return to the temple.\n\n\n Seeming to put more emphasis on the dinner party afterwards, than on throwing Tau fruit at each other in the northern area, some people had started preparations at the plaza’s water wells located here and there. Others were setting up impromptu tables by laying boards across wooden boxes, as dishes are brought in from houses all around.\n\n\n “If they get hungry, that will have to wait until evening.”\n\n\n “As expected, they aren’t open yet, huh?”\n\n\n I’m sure even the partiers causing an uproar throwing Tau fruit, will remember how hungry they are once the food starts being given out.\n\n\n ◇◆◇◆\n\n\n “Geeze! Good lord! Look at you! Can you stay outside until I draw you a bath, otherwise you will get the room filthy!?”\n\n\n Before getting scolded by mother, we were yelled at by Delia. While I was agreeing with a slight nod to Lutz’ murmuring of “Hey, isn’t she more scary than Aunt Elfa?,” Fran, who had changed into his casual forest clothing (in case he got wet) showed up.\n\n\n Looking at the two of us who are sopping wet, he rubs his temples as if distressed.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, let’s please head to the orphanage now, since it seems that the orphans are ready to celebrate the festival. Delia, I task you with drawing a bath so that Sister Ma?ne can immediately use it once we get back.”\n\n\n “Yes!”\n\n\n Because Delia said that she can’t do something so common as throwing Tau fruit, she decides to stay back. It seems that Gil had already gone to the orphanage a long time ago.\n\n\n “I was contacted by a gray-robed priest who readied the carriages used to transport the blue-robed priests to the noble district. It looks like the main gate has been closed since all the blue-robed priests and their attendants have left for the noble district.”\n\n\n By the time we returned to the orphanage through the backdoor way, everyone had already changed from their priestly clothes into old clothes, and had taken the Tau fruit, which had been stored in the basement outside.\n\n\n Upon Lutz’ instruction to split them into two teams, Fran appropriately divides everyone, taking into consideration the ages and number of men and women so as to turn it into an even throwing match. We designate an area where it’s fine for them to run around, and made them promise not to go outside the area’s boundary.\n\n\n “You will have to definitely clean up afterwards. And, take care to not rouse the curiosity of the townspeople by making too much noise. Lastly, enjoy yourselves without fighting or hurting each other. Do you understand?”\n\n\n “Yes!”\n\n\n “Then I guess we will hand out the Tau fruit.”\n\n\n Lutz doesn’t move, he merely looks towards the several baskets. At such times I, who have the highest social standing, have to move first.\n\n\n Even though the Tau fruit I had seen in the forest in the spring was just about the size of the first knuckle joint of the thumb, the fruits inside the baskets now were larger than my fist. As they seem to be engorged with water, they felt like jelly.\n\n\n Because I had closed my eyes for the most part when I was hit by so many of them, that might be the first time that I’m carefully examining a Tau fruit.\n\n\n “Waaah, they have gotten really big.”\n\n\n The instant I pick up the first fruit, I feel mana being absorbed just like at the time of offering. At the same time the Tau fruit started to change its appearance, while bubbling unevenly.\n\n\n “E-Eek!?”\n\n\n “What’s wrong, Ma?ne!?”\n\n\n “My mana is being sucked up!”\n\n\n Inside the Tau fruit that previously had a translucent red color just like a water balloon, hard-looking seeds similar to a pomegranate, start to increasingly appear one after the other.\n\n\n “How gross! What’s this!?”\n\n\n “As if I’d know!?”\n\n\n As I’m moving about in confusion holding this in my hand, the fruit’s pale red color is slowly deepening. The inside of the fruit is now filled more with seeds than with water. Its skin, which used to be flabby, becomes hard and so dark that the inside can’t be seen anymore.\n\n\n Now that it has changed so much, I finally realize there’s no doubt that this red fruit is a seed of Tronbay which I have seen before!\n\n\n “Lutz, this is Tronbay! Get a knife ready! Its fast-growth is coming!”\n\n\n “Are you kidding!?”\n\n\n Once I say that while still holding the Tau fruit, Lutz, who had watched the Tau fruit changing its shape, immediately rushes off to the basement that’s used for storage. He hurls orders to the orphans while dragging out a basket with edged tools that seem to be knives and hatchets.\n\n\n “Those who know how to harvest, grab a knife. An expensive ingredient for making paper has appeared. Harvest it without leaving a single piece behind!”\n\n\n “Yes!”\n\n\n At the same time as the orphans rush to the knives, the skin of Tau fruit becomes more firm and starts getting hotter. Previously, when I threw one hot like this, the Tronbay’s fast-growth took place.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, I am ready!”\n\n\n Gil, who smartly wields a hatchet-like tool, stands beside me like some anime hero 3 ready to protect me with his life. Lutz holds a knife in one hand and points at a spot with no stone paving where grass grows thickly.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, throw it there, at the unpaved ground!”\n\n\n While listening to Gil’s and Lutz’ voices, I turn to where I can see the soil, and throw the Tau fruit with all my strength.\n\n\n “Gooo, you fast-growing tree!”\n\n\n Notes:\n\n\n 1 – Basically girls to be offered as mistresses to the nobles.\n\n\n 2 – Japanese thin noodle often eaten chilled in summer. Won’t go too far into detail, easy to find on Google\n\n\n 3 – The raw mentions “sentai hero” here. Well you probably all know these weird hero squadrons for children that fight against evil characters. They have been referenced like a trillion times in anime. Most popular representatives would be Power Rangers. Changed it up here a bit to sound a bit more localized."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “You idiot, what kind of throw was that?”\n\n\n Lutz watched in dismay as the Tau fruit struck the stone path, just short of the soil.\n\n\n There was a loud series of popping noises, almost like popcorn kernels bursting in a pan. The seeds burst from the red fruit and covered the ground with a writhing mass of sprouts. Those that reached the soil took root, while those that fell short withered rapidly. In the blink of an eye, the sprouts had already grown ankle high.\n\n\n “Eep!”\n\n\n “Wah wah!?”\n\n\n “These things grow fast.” said Lutz, “As soon as they reach our knees, we’ll harvest them one by one.”\n\n\n Lutz directed the wary orphans, while keeping a determined eye on the quickly growing Tronbay.\n\n\n “Fran, take Ma?ne and stand back!”\n\n\n At Lutz’ instruction, Fran carried me to a safe distance. Unable to even hold a blade, I could only give encouragement.\n\n\n “Everybody, do your best~!”\n\n\n “Let’s get started!”\n\n\n Lutz ran to the furthest saplings and began harvesting the Tronbay with a hatchet-like tool. Gil, who was running just behind Lutz, had started cutting first.\n\n\n “Haa…” Gil shouted as he swung the blade.\n\n\n Gil’s blade makes a cracking noise as he cuts down a thin branch-like sapling. The Tronbay, felled by his wild slashes stops growing as it falls to the ground. The children, having watched how simple it was for Gil, join in on culling the growing Tronbay.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, what is going on?”\n\n\n Depending on what Fran tells the Head Priest, I could end up with another mind-numbing lecture. I wrack my brain for a good way to convince him that this was a normal occurance outside the temple, and not a big deal.\n\n\n “We can use what we harvest here to make high-quality paper. It’s a rare ingredient so you should know that this is a great opportunity for us. ”\n\n\n While it was technically the truth, Fran’s question remained unanswered. As he began to speak again, Fran was interrupted.\n\n\n “The saplings have grown too thick;” Gil shouted “knives can’t cut through them anymore. Fall back, I’ll handle the rest.”\n\n\n I quickly face Gil as he grabs a girl, easily pulling her away from the plants, and energetically slashes at the now waist-high saplings. It’s clear that Gil, who had spent many a joyful day working in the forest, had grown strong.\n\n\n “Woohoo, I did it!”\n\n\n Gil proudly struck a triumphant pose and gave me a broad smile. He looked at me expectantly; “Praise me afterwards” he seemed to appeal. I nodded slightly.\n\n\n “Are there any left?” Lutz asked.\n\n\n After a brief search, the children shook their heads.\n\n\n “What do you think Lutz?” I asked “Should we do this a few more times?\n\n\n This is a good chance to gather such precious material in relative safety. It’d be a shame to waste this opportunity.”\n\n\n Lutz gave his head a tilted shake and said, “Let’s do it one or two more times, then we can start throwing Tau fruit at each other. It looks like the seeds that didn’t land in the soil have withered away, but we should be able to find more in the forest.”\n\n\n “Would everyone be willing to do this a few more times?” asked Ma?ne. “I would greatly appreciate it. We can make a high quality paper with the harvested Tronbay. This will allow me to increase the budget for the orphanage.”\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, how will it help if the budget increases?”\n\n\n These children have no understanding of money. For them, everything is provided as God’s Blessing. I could try to explain that, in society, everything requires money. That, as orphans, they would be unable to cover their own living expenses, not to mention the soup they enjoy so much. Though I doubt that I could make them understand.\n\n\n “If the budget increases, the meals you can make for yourselves will increase. We would also be able to buy more winter firewood for the orphanage.”\n\n\n “Alright, let’s do it!”\n\n\n Firewood is precious, as the orphanage is given very little. The orphanage has only two fireplaces, one in the mess hall on the girls’ side and another in a large room on the boys’ side. The stone building retains heat poorly and rapidly cools as soon the fireplaces burn out. The orphans spend many days and nights of winter huddled together like penguins.\n\n\n In an environment with scarce resources, wintertime food and heating is a critical concern.\n\n\n With the suddenly eager children, we were able to harvest Tronbay three more times. The baskets were full of Tronbay branches alone. Since we have to process them into rind as fast as possible, we ended the Tronbay gathering at this point.\n\n\n “Well then, I guess we can throw the remaining Tau fruit at each other?”\n\n\n The children, who are still full of motivation to harvest Tronbay, blink at Lutz in confusion.\n\n\n “Eeh? Isn’t it fine to turn all of the rest into paper as well?”\n\n\n “Nah, it will be fine to go out again to pick them once we run out. Just like today.”\n\n\n The children cheer at Lutz’ words. They had very much enjoyed venturing into the forest to gather Tau fruit. How enviable.\n\n\n The repeated Tronbay harvest had left the grounds full of gouged-out holes and littered with dead weeds. Everyone works to clean up by filling in the holes, smoothing the dirt, and stomping down any loose paving stones.\n\n\n “The weeds around here are completely gone, but it can’t be helped, right?”\n\n\n “I guess so. However, in this season things like grass will grow back quickly.”\n\n\n “… Let’s just say that it saved us the hassle of weeding.”\n\n\n The Ritual of the Star Union had finished and no blue-robed priest would visit this backyard. I concluded that there would likely be no particular problem with that.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you’re looking pale and feverish. Go change clothes. I’ll handle the Tau fruit match.”\n\n\n “Yeah, I think you’re right. I’m feeling sluggish and cold.”\n\n\n Fran carries me in his arms and says “Delia should have prepared the bath by now, so your body will probably warm up quickly.”\n\n\n As Fran whisks me away, I peer back over his shoulder. The orphans were split into two groups throwing Tau fruit at each other. Their joyous shouts and squeals are no different than those of the lower-city children. I think I’d like to bring a bit more fun to the orphanage.\n\n\n “Geeze! What do you think you’re doing!?” Delia stares daggers at me and continues, “Destroying your health by playing around in the orphanage is not proper behavior for a blue-robed priestess!”\n\n\n Delia was upset at my worn-out appearance as we return to my rooms. She has Fran carry me into the bathroom and then chases him out. After stripping me of my damp clothes, she places me into the bath that she had prepared earlier. Delia keeps adding hot water to the bath until she is satisfied with the temperature.\n\n\n I quietly mumble “You really like the bath to be hot, don’t you?”\n\n\n Delia’s glare hardens “The bath has to be hot because your body is chilled to the bone. As weak as you are, you shouldn’t be out playing in the water. Don’t you at least understand that much? Geeze!”\n\n\n “… Delia, be quiet for a bit. After all it’s such a nice bath at long last.”\n\n\n A grateful sigh of relief leaves my mouth as the hot bath warms my body.\n\n\n “That’s only natural since it was prepared by me.”\n\n\n “Yes, it’s just as you say, Delia. It’s very comfortable, thanks to you. Thank you.”\n\n\n Given that I’m unable to draw water from a well to this very day, I’m incapable of preparing a bath by myself.\n\n\n “I just did what I was told to do. I’m not like Gil. Something like gratitude for all my hard work…”\n\n\n Despite her quiet grumbling, I know that she’s simply bashful.\n\n\n Giggling quietly, I submerge my shoulders and think about Tronbay.\n\n\n Was I unaware of it last time because it was almost on the verge of sprouting or because I had absolutely no knowledge about my mana and the Devouring? I didn’t feel the flow of mana at all the first time.\n\n\n This time I clearly sensed mana flowing into the Tau fruit. I think it takes around 2 or 3 small magic stones worth of mana to cause an engorged Tau fruit to bud.\n\n\n It depends on the amount of mana currently possessed by those with the Devouring, but I believe that we could reduce the number of children dying from the Devouring if we use Tau fruit. If we make the Devouring well-known, we can let the people disperse their mana with Tau fruit. Ma?ne’s Workshop could then accept the offcuts right? That was my overly optimistic calculation.\n\n\n However, if what Lutz said is true, then the Tau fruit can’t be preserved. If they are separated from the soil in the spring, the water in them will vanish within half a day. Even in the summer the fruit will only last a couple of days before drying up, just like the seeds that missed the soil today.\n\n\n I don’t think they will wither as quickly if I place them on a soil similar to where Tronbay grows, but I’m scared that they will be washed away by wind and rain causing Tronbay to sprout in the middle of the city come autumn.\n\n\n “… I suppose I will report to Mister Benno for starters?”\n\n\n I will report that we can now collect Tronbay as we like from spring to the beginning of autumn. I will also ask him to spread the information on Tau fruit and the Devouring, and to gather information regarding Tronbay.\n\n\n With my thoughts concluded, I step out of the bath and am hit by a wave of dizziness. I don’t know if it was due to the fever or not.\n\n\n I grab my head as I crumble to the ground with a thud. Delia covers her mouth and stifles a scream. She quickly works to dry me off and dress me in a blouse and skirt, frantically calling for Fran as she finishes.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne!”\n\n\n “… Oh, don’t worry about there not being a mattress on the bed. You can put me down, I will be fine with laying on top of the base board.”\n\n\n Fran, who didn’t know where to put me, ended up just holding me awkwardly in his arms, but he immediately laid me down carefully when he heard my words.\n\n\n “Delia, go and call Lutz. Fran, can I have you change clothes so that you can go outside? It looks like it would be best for me to go home early today…”\n\n\n “Certainly.”\n\n\n Since Lutz took part in the Tau throwing match together with the children, he was naturally sopping wet, so Fran carried me home.\n\n\n Upon hearing Lutz explain that I had to change at the temple after receiving concentrated fire at the festival, mother sighed and said “As expected. I knew that something like this would happen if Ma?ne went to the Star Festival. Please do me the favor of informing the Head Priest that she will need to stay in bed for several days, okay?”\n\n\n Fran nods and apologizes gravely about his being an incapable attendant as mother puts me into bed.\n\n\n “Did you enjoy the festival that put you in this sorry state?”\n\n\n “… Yeah, there were plenty of things that startled me, but all of the orphans were smiling. That was nice.”\n\n\n Just as my family and Lutz thought, I develop a fever and am bedridden for three days. I ask Lutz, who has come to make a sick visit, to report to Benno about the Tronbay and Tau fruit. Later Lutz relays the following answer from Benno: “I want to talk about the details so when your fever has subsided, come to my store before going to the temple.”\n\n\n ◇◆◇◆\n\n\n “Good morning, Mister Benno.”\n\n\n “You caused trouble again Ma?ne, didn’t you?” Benno asked, glaring at me with his reddish brown eyes.\n\n\n Flinching, I try to respond “… Trouble, you say; didn’t I manage to find a reliable way to gather Tronbay which we thought was too unpredictable to use as a material? If you can prepare a number of people in advance, it will be safe since we can harvest it easily, so shouldn’t you praise me?”\n\n\n “As for that, you are certainly right. Confirming that the Tau fruit is the seed of Tronbay is a joyous matter as it will allow us to safely gather Tronbay. However, there are many troubles connected to that, right?”\n\n\n “Is that so?”\n\n\n Seeing my blank expression, Benno mutters “So you haven’t thought about it at all, have you?” and turns to Lutz, who was standing next to me.\n\n\n “Sorry Lutz, but please inform the Head Priest that Ma?ne’s arrival will be delayed. After that stay with Mark until I call you. This lecture is going to take a while.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir.”\n\n\n Lutz smiles bitterly, leaving behind a half-hearted encouragement: “Do your best, Ma?ne”.\n\n\n In a room that lacked any allies for me, Benno is lightly tapping on top of the table.\n\n\n “I heard from Lutz: The Tau fruit suddenly absorbed your mana, grew in one go and turned into Tronbay. Is that right?”\n\n\n “Yes.”\n\n\n “Does it look like it could be a replacement for magic tools?”\n\n\n The fact that Tau fruit cannot be obtained during winter is worrying, but if I use around 20 Tau fruit, I probably won’t die of mana overflow until the following spring. Since it seems that mana capacity grows with the body, I don’t know around how many will be necessary once I become an adult.\n\n\n “… I believe it will. Therefore…”\n\n\n “This must absolutely never become known.” Benno interrupts sternly.\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n I had intended him to spread information regarding the usage of Tau fruit for the very sake of saving those suffering from the Devouring, so my eyes widen in disbelief at Benno’s response.\n\n\n “The management of mana is under the jurisdiction of the nobles. If they learn that a fruit that can be easily picked up in the forest can replace expensive magic tools, the current state of affairs in noble society and in the temple will be upended. If it’s passed on in a weird way, you will probably get crushed.”\n\n\n “… But, if we stay silent, commoners with the Devouring will remain a lost cause, won’t they?\n\n\n Although I found a precious method of saving them, one that doesn’t even cost any money, those who can be saved won’t be saved if they don’t know!”\n\n\n “Yes, that’s correct. However, how can you tell if children have the Devouring? Is there a way fellow Devouring sufferers can recognise each other?”\n\n\n I shake my head. The only person with the Devouring I’ve met is Frieda, but I couldn’t tell Frieda possessed mana or had the Devouring by just looking. There’s no way for me to save anyone if I don’t know whether they have the Devouring or not.\n\n\n “It might be possible to identify at birth whether children possess mana or not by having them hold that fruit, but the moment it’s known they possess mana, they will likely be taken away by the nobles. What parent would try to identify them if they know they will be taken away as soon as they are found out? At least in your case, you couldn’t take your family along, right?”\n\n\n I am suddenly at a loss for words. Not wanting to be separated from my family, I thought I needed a means to stay alive without having to rely on magic tools. That was for the sake of avoiding the nobles. If we identify those with the Devouring on a grand scale, the nobles will likely learn of me, and it will all have been for nothing.\n\n\n And there’s no way that the information to save people from the Devouring through the Tau fruit will circulate if it’s not spread on a grand scale.\n\n\n “Would you instead have any and all fever-prone children brought to you? Are you going to turn them away, saying that If it was the Devouring, it would be healed with Tau fruit, but since it’s a different sickness then tough luck? If you did that, you would just receive those with strange diseases instead, and pointlessly invite the hatred of their parents if you couldn’t cure them.”\n\n\n It’s clear that I would be told, “Even though you easily healed the sickness of that child, why won’t you do the same for our child?” I clench my fists at the scene Benno predicted. I hadn’t thought that far ahead.\n\n\n “Besides, is there absolutely no chance that they won’t become a problem growing up with the Devouring without having to rely on the nobles? Will they be able to handle the mana of the Devouring correctly if they grow up without any knowledge? How will the temple operate its ritual articles if they can’t look after the children of nobles who can’t afford magic tools? Won’t it turn into something that shakes the foundation of the noble society itself?”\n\n\n “… I don’t know.”\n\n\n I am unable to answer any of the problems he rattled off. I don’t know about the social situation, the structure of politics and even the treatment of mana in this world.\n\n\n “As for the advantage in saving those with the Devouring, you don’t even know how many are afflicted, and the aftermath could be disastrous. Say nothing for now, and just be grateful that you have obtained a means to secretly stay alive even if you are expelled from the temple or if it turns into a situation where you are threatened by being denied magic tools. The situation would get out of hand quickly. At the very least, I won’t be able to handle it.”\n\n\n There’s no way that I can handle something that Benno can’t. If I’m asked whether I want to sow confusion, just when the state of affairs has calmed down after the purge and mass appointments in the central government and with the current lack of nobles, the answer is no. I don’t want to do something as troublesome as that.\n\n\n “If it’s just picking up Tronbay in the forest, it’s probably possible to use that as a deception, since that is what we’ve been doing so far. But I believe it would be best to stay silent regarding life extension and identification of those with the Devouring.”\n\n\n “… Okay.”\n\n\n I’m still not happy at all that I cannot save the lives that I should be able to save, even if I understand it logically. My dissatisfaction likely showed on my face clearly. Benno shrugged his shoulders helplessly.\n\n\n “Don’t put on such a face. … It’s fine if you secretly help those whom you happen to find. I’m just telling you to not let the nobles suspect anything. Can you declare war against noble society? The customers for your books will be nobles, right?”\n\n\n I laughed at Benno’s last words. It cheered me up a bit. If there’s someone suffering from the Devouring in front of me, I will save them. Places that I can’t see are none of my business. It’s best if I just keep that mindset.\n\n\n “At the very least I won’t be able to declare a war until I have raised the literacy rate to the level that ordinary citizens will be able to freely read books. Though it’s still unthinkable for me to do such troublesome thing.”\n\n\n Our conversation becomes more light-hearted and Benno’s expression loosens up as he sighs “Well certainly, reaching the point where ordinary people can read is troublesome, isn’t it?”\n\n\n “That isn’t what’s troublesome; the declaration of war is. If I want to spread books, it’s only natural for me to want to raise the literacy rate.”\n\n\n After all, I got into the temple with great pains. “Sooner or later I intend to start a small temple school separate from the temple elementary school, using the orphanage. First I will educate the orphans, and train the grey-robed priests to be teachers.”\n\n\n Once I develop what I remember of printing techniques…I continue, “Then, I can create textbooks based on the Scriptures. If I propagate the Scriptures, even the Temple Master shouldn’t have any complaints.”\n\n\n I conclude by asking Benno, “How about that? It’s perfect, isn’t it?”\n\n\n I puff up with pride and chuckle; but Benno is at his wits’ end for some reason.\n\n\n “Since it’s your plan, I imagine it will be full of holes, but that’s fine. … Say, Ma?ne, can’t you use your head for anything else but books?”\n\n\n “Probably not.”\n\n\n “Well, given that I have never used it for anything besides books, it’s more like I don’t know whether I can use it or not though”, I add.\n\n\n Benno sighs very, very deeply “You are too disappointing.”\n\n\n “How rude!”\n\n\n Benno laughs and says, “It’s the truth” then changes his expression all of a sudden. With a serious expression and a somewhat lowered volume he starts a serious topic.\n\n\n “That means you have to keep silent about the Tau fruit so that we can monopolize the Tronbay as long as possible, is that clear?”\n\n\n “Yes.”\n\n\n “Well then, I’d like to hear your opinion about the last entry on the problem list I handed you the other day.”\n\n\n … Ah, is that why he sent Lutz away on an errand?\n\n\n Realizing that Lutz had been sent away so Benno could ask about this in private, I widen my eyes and gulp."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “As you know, Lutz is a minor. If he wants to travel outside the city for work, he absolutely requires permission from his parents. Taking him without getting permission would be considered the same as kidnapping.”\n\n\n Taking a deep sigh, Benno began explaining the situation. I am grateful for the extra information since the assignment list had simply stated Persuade Lutz’ parents to give permission for him to go on a trip.\n\n\n “I already sent Mark but he was unable to get their permission. I don’t know if it is because merchants and craftsmen have different formalities, or if his father is simply stubborn. I’d like to hear what you think.”\n\n\n “I’m not sure how much help I can be… You’re having trouble getting permission for Lutz to travel, right? This is a conversation for you, Lutz, and his parents. Even as his childhood friend, I’m still pretty much an outsider in this matter.”\n\n\n Benno wants to take Lutz outside the city for work; Lutz needs to be able to travel; Lutz’ parents need to be convinced to permit it. These are the four people concerned. I feel like I shouldn’t meddle in their affairs.\n\n\n When I say as much to Benno, he stares intensely at me and scratches his head roughly.\n\n\n “That’s why I’m asking for your opinion, Ma?ne. I need as much information as possible. If Lutz knows you best, then you should know Lutz best, right?”\n\n\n Benno wants to gather information before the discussion with Lutz’ parents so he can prepare for all eventualities in advance. With as much time as I spend with him, I very likely do know Lutz best, except in regards to his work.\n\n\n “He needs to travel for work, so why would they refuse permission?”\n\n\n “That’s what I want to know. According to Mark, Lutz’ father stubbornly disapproved. I got an idea of Lutz’ hectic family environment when I lent him the attic, but what exactly is his situation?\n\n\n Now that he mentions it, we rarely speak of our home life with Benno.\n\n\n Even to me Lutz doesn’t talk about his family much. Not since the atmosphere at his home deteriorated when he declared his intention to be a merchant apprentice. I believe that he is even less willing to talk to Benno and Mark since it would feel like he’s whining to his superiors.\n\n\n “To begin with, Lutz’s family objected to him becoming a merchant apprentice.”\n\n\n “What did you say? That means they didn’t just object to him becoming a peddler, but even to becoming a merchant in the city?”\n\n\n I slowly nod to Benno as his eyes widen in surprise.\n\n\n “Since his father works in construction and his older brothers are craftsmen apprentices in construction and woodworking, I heard they wanted Lutz to become a craftsman as well. They say that the steady work of a craftsman is better and more stable than that of a merchant with its intense ups and downs.”\n\n\n “It’s not like being a craftsman is stable either, is it?”\n\n\n Given that there are also workshops that go out of business, you can’t say that a craftsman’s job is definitely stable. But if they are skilled, they will be hired by workshops in the same trade as opposed to managing and being expected to shoulder the debts of a shop.\n\n\n “I also happened to hear from Lutz that he was told that he definitely won’t be allowed to become a merchant.”\n\n\n Even filtered through Lutz, there were many cruel remarks such as it’s an occupation where one has to be ruthless or that they don’t create anything and only take a cut from craftsmen. Their way of speaking makes me wonder just what kind of corrupt merchant scammed them.\n\n\n “… Lutz did well to become a merchant in such circumstances, didn’t he?”\n\n\n Lutz might be a bit different, if you consider that the children in this city become apprentices by joining their parent’s line of work through their familial connections. But, since he’s lively in his work, I believe that Lutz’s choice wasn’t wrong.\n\n\n “Lutz intended to become a live-in apprentice if his parents were adamantly against it. Since Aunt Karla… Lutz’ mother only approved after seeing just how serious Lutz was, the family is tolerating it for now.“\n\n\n “Live-in apprentice? He had problems with his family to the degree of considering something like that?”\n\n\n Benno blinked. Eccentric children that choose the inferior circumstances of a live-in apprentice usually don’t exist. By considering becoming a live-in apprentice, it was as if they declared that they believe such an inferior position to be better than staying with their own family.\n\n\n “I don’t know anything since Lutz hasn’t told me whether they currently have a good relationship or not. However, it bothers me that Lutz’ older brothers actually look down on him quite a bit because of this.”\n\n\n “They look down on him?”\n\n\n “In the eyes of his family, it might look as if Lutz is doing as he pleases while defying his father. They might only be opposing him as they can’t see Lutz’ hard work or his accomplishments because he’s not in the same industry. I have never talked with his brothers about Lutz, so I don’t know.”\n\n\n [Support the translation by reading this at infinitenoveltranslations.net]\n\n\n I’ve never properly discussed Lutz with his brothers, and I haven’t even spoken with Lutz’s father.\n\n\n I know that the eldest son, Sascha, resembles him the most among Lutz’ siblings and that he has pride in his work as craftsman, but that’s all. I often see his mother chatting by the well, but I never saw his father much.\n\n\n “… However, I think that Lutz will run away from home if he learns that his dream will be crushed due to opposition from his parents. After all Lutz is stubborn and won’t yield on something once he’s decided on it. But, becoming a live-in apprentice is the last resort, right? With the extra burden of domestic chores, living alone will be hard for Lutz, so no matter what he says, I believe that his family is something he should rely on.”\n\n\n “That’s right.”\n\n\n Saying that, Benno smiles bitterly, glancing up at the upper floor. It’s obvious that Benno, whose parents died early, holds family very dear when you see how he looks at Corinna. He holds such deep affection that he stayed single after losing his lover. I don’t believe for an instant that he wants to cause a rift in Lutz’ family.\n\n\n “So there’s no other choice but to explain it to Lutz and have him endure until adulthood if you wish for this to end harmoniously? Since there won’t be any need for something like parental permission once he becomes an adult, the safest approach would be to choose to wait while avoiding a confrontation with his family, right?”\n\n\n It would be different if he was barred from leaving the city for his entire life without his parent’s permission, but since he can achieve his dream once he becomes an adult, I think it would be best if he endured it for now. Short of Lutz declaring that he can’t stand his family any longer, there is no need to cause such a rift in his family.\n\n\n Benno shakes his head and looks grim-faced at my suggestion to play it safe.\n\n\n “By then it will be too late.”\n\n\n “Too late for what?”\n\n\n I wonder, is there anything so urgent? Once I tilt my head in confusion, Benno suddenly frowns and averts his eyes.\n\n\n “These are my circumstances. … For now I won’t talk about it, okay?”\n\n\n If those are circumstances related to his work, it’s not good for me to hear too much, as I am not a part of Gilberta Company. After I lightly passed it off with a “I see,” he groans out a “Yeah.”\n\n\n “Let’s assume then that this matter would cause a rift between Lutz and his family, for argument’s sake. I believe that Lutz will choose living as merchant over his family, but Mister Benno, how far are you willing to go to support Lutz? Since you’re planning to take him outside the city, you definitely have expectations of him. However, to what extent are you going to support Lutz in his life, seeing as he’s only one of your apprentices?”\n\n\n Benno doesn’t bear any responsibility towards Lutz, who has formed a Dalua Contract with him, in regards to his livelihood. If he does look after Lutz’ livelihood, it will also create dissent among the other Dalua.\n\n\n If Benno has no interest in taking care of the practical side of life, Lutz will suffer even more if he becomes a live-in apprentice. It would be better to keep the status quo, than do that.\n\n\n When I pin him with a stare that says that I won’t forgive him for playing with Lutz’ life, he raises his hands in surrender\n\n\n “As for me… I’m considering adopting him.”\n\n\n “Eeh!?”\n\n\n I was taken aback by a reply beyond my expectations.\n\n\n If Benno is going so far for Lutz, I won’t be worried even if Lutz runs away from home. Even if Lutz chooses to separate from his family and leave the city as a travelling merchant, there won’t be any problems that threaten his choice if he’s backed by Benno.\n\n\n “I didn’t expect for you to go so far for him, Mister Benno. Isn’t the best course of action to explain the situation to Lutz and then talk to Lutz’ parents together with him?”\n\n\n “Talk to Lutz, huh…?”\n\n\n Benno exhales with a “hmm,” obviously hesitating.\n\n\n “No matter what you do, I think Lutz’ will is important. After all, Lutz has always thought things over by himself so far.”\n\n\n Adopting him means that Lutz will eventually inherit Benno’s store. Since he said that the Gilberta Company will be inherited by Corinna’s child, I think that Lutz will probably take over the businesses related to Ma?ne Workshop, such as the paper crafting and the italian restaurant. That’s likely the reason why Benno wants me to link up with Lutz at the time they create a new paper workshop.\n\n\n Realizing that Lutz’ hard work up till now had been recognized by Benno, I am very happy as if I were the one being praised here.\n\n\n “I suppose you are happy since Lutz will become my adopted child?”\n\n\n “It’s not about him becoming your adopted child, I’m happy that Lutz’ efforts are valued highly.”\n\n\n Benno laughs with a “pfft,” rings the bell and calls Mark. It looks like this is the end of the secret talk.\n\n\n “What might be your order, master?”\n\n\n “Call Lutz.”\n\n\n “As you wish.”\n\n\n Mark leaves the room at once with beautiful movements that look as if they are flowing and then returns with Lutz in tow. I guess Lutz has been carefully watching and imitating Mark. The similarity in their movements is amusing.\n\n\n “Lutz.”\n\n\n “Yes, master.”\n\n\n “There’s something I’d like to discuss with your parents next time. Can you set up an appointment in the near future?”\n\n\n Lutz blinks, obviously confused by Benno’s sudden question and slightly tilts his head in puzzlement.\n\n\n “… With my parents? Okay, I understand.”\n\n\n Benno nods slightly after receiving Lutz’ acknowledgement for the time being and states the day’s business details to Lutz. It is something along the lines of him having to go work at Ma?ne’s Workshop on the mass production of Tronbay paper after escorting me to the temple.\n\n\n “Certainly. Let’s go Ma?ne.”\n\n\n “Yeah. Then, Mister Benno, best regards.”\n\n\n “Ma?ne, think about your other assignments as well.”\n\n\n “Yeees…”\n\n\n I head towards the temple together with Lutz. As just about everything seems to be looking up for Lutz, I end up humming spontaneously.\n\n\n “You are in a good mood, aren’t you Ma?ne?”\n\n\n “I am happy, after all.”\n\n\n “Well, it’s great that you seem to be relatively lively after receiving master’s sermon.”\n\n\n “Uh… don’t make me remember that.”\n\n\n According to what Lutz had said along the way, it looks like he had been sent to Ma?ne’s Workshop by Benno to mass produce Tronbay paper while I was down with fever. It also seems like he went to the forest together with the orphans, mass produced black rind, picked up kalfe potatoes just like the two of us often did, and made buttered kalfe.\n\n\n “It feels more like I’m the workshop head than you, doesn’t it Ma?ne?”\n\n\n I shrug my shoulders a bit at Lutz’ comment. Apparently a blue-robed priestess mustn’t do any manual labour, so I’m not allowed to get involved. Given that everyone’s doing it joyfully, I want to mingle with them, but I have been banned from doing so.\n\n\n “While I’m the workshop head as blue-robed priestess, it’s only a title for the sake of raising revenue. Do your best, since I pay you, the one who’s actually running it, a salary befitting a workshop head assistant.”\n\n\n “Calling it workshop head assistant; that’s cool, but it’s basically just being your helper, right? I guess nothing’s changed even now.”\n\n\n “It probably won’t change in the future either. After all, I will come up with new merchandise and you will sell it, Lutz.”\n\n\n Even making Lutz produce paper and teaching the orphans at Ma?ne Workshop is likely a part of Benno’s training, and necessary for circulating paper made from plants.\n\n\n “… Huh? There’s no one here?”\n\n\n Although we entered the temple, none of my attendants can be seen at the gate. This is the first time since I came to the temple that no one has been waiting at the gate.\n\n\n “I guess it’s because I told Fran that I didn’t know when we would arrive, as you were going to be scolded by master. I think it would be best to directly head to your room?”\n\n\n “Yeah,” I say.\n\n\n “I’m going to the workshop, okay? I will pick you up on my way home.”\n\n\n I bid farewell to Lutz at the base of the stairs heading towards the hall of worship, climb the stairs and make my way to my own room after going around the orphanage.\n\n\n The door, which has always been opened by my attendants, remains closed, so I’m slightly perplexed.\n\n\n I wonder whether it’s fine for me to loudly open the door? Or is it better to knock lightly since it will be dangerous if someone’s in there? Or maybe it might be the best to call out to the inside and wait until it’s opened?\n\n\n Even if I want to call my attendants, it’s not like I’m carrying a bell and they will scold me for being improper if I shout for them. Hmm, what would be the best option here? I tried to consider the proper, noble-like behaviour, but since it’s ridiculous for me to be this conflicted just to enter my own room, I decide to open the door after knocking lightly.\n\n\n … There’s no one present who might get angry anyway. Let’s ask Fran about the correct manners later.\n\n\n I knock and say “I’m coming in.” Turning the knob and opening the door, I see Fran descending the stairs at a quick pace while looking flustered.\n\n\n “Good morning, Fran. I made you worry, didn’t I? My fever has come down, so I’m alright now.”\n\n\n Fran throws a quick glance at the second floor with an extremely embarrassed expression and whispers,\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, as a matter of fact…”\n\n\n “What’s this about a lady walking by herself without taking any attendants along?”\n\n\n “Eh!? Head Priest!?”\n\n\n I never expected to see the Head Priest in my room! I stare blankly up at the Head Priest who is looking down on me from the second floor.\n\n\n “Close your mouth. How indecent. … Apart from that, I don’t know about outside, but make sure to never do something so disgraceful such as walking inside the temple by yourself.”\n\n\n Urged on by Fran, I head to the second floor and obediently listen to his tediously long scolding while sitting in front of the Head Priest and elegantly drinking tea.\n\n\n According to the Head Priest, the correct way of opening a door, one befitting a noble, is to “Always give a previous announcement and have your attendants wait at the gate” or “Inform the gatekeeper of your arrival and wait for your attendants to arrive in the waiting room.”\n\n\n … That’s a bit too fussy for me.\n\n\n Don’t scold me so much just because I opened a single door. Seeing as he could go on indefinitely, I change the topic by asking about the Head Priest’s visit.\n\n\n “Head Priest, I understand the way of opening a door.”\n\n\n “It’s not about how to open a door! Just what did you hear!? I was talking about the way you should conduct yourself as lady…”\n\n\n Oh my, looks like the scolding wasn’t about how to open a door.\n\n\n Interrupting the Head Priest at a point before he can get fired up and restart the scolding, I ask him,\n\n\n “Might I inquire as to the reason for your visit? For you to specially come visit my room, there must be quite a reason, right? Is it something urgent?”\n\n\n Normally I would have already started on sorting documents a while ago. He mentioned that he has some leeway due to my help, but him allotting that extra time to scolding me will be unbearable.\n\n\n Does the Head Priest recall the main issue at hand? He clears his throat lightly and looks at me.\n\n\n “Did the fever go down completely?”\n\n\n “Eh? Yes, I have completely recovered. I’m very sorry for having caused you worry.”\n\n\n “That’s great.”\n\n\n [Read this ad-free at the translator’s site at infinitenoveltranslations.net]\n\n\n While calling it great, the Head Priest reveals a smile that chills me to the bone. I straighten up my back in shock as he switched to the sermon mode of the secret room.\n\n\n “I’m sure I told you to not cause an uproar. Didn’t I?”\n\n\n “Eh? Huh?”\n\n\n As I had just returned from days in bed with a fever, followed by an intense discussion with Benno, I stare blankly at the Head Priest for a moment before I realized what he was talking about.\n\n\n “I checked the Orphanage grounds to see if everything had been properly cleaned up. I found much of the soil churned up and the paving stones in disarray.”\n\n\n I had counted on the blue-robed priests avoiding the place, but it looks like the Head Priest made the effort to check it out himself. It seems that he’s neurotic and must check everything himself, despite being so busy.\n\n\n He narrows his golden eyes and pins me to the chair with the intensity of his stare.\n\n\n “Just how did you cause such a situation?”\n\n\n “How, you ask… umm… as I told you before…”\n\n\n I glance nervously towards Fran. I wonder just what Fran told him. I have no excuses that could keep me out of trouble.\n\n\n “I asked Fran and some of the orphans, but they only said that you cut a tree that will become a raw material for paper, threw Tau fruit, and that you collapsed after being afflicted by fever, but…?”\n\n\n “… we really haven’t done anything besides that.”\n\n\n Jumping on the explanation he’s given, I nod quickly.\n\n\n I guess they haven’t revealed that the Tau fruit absorbed my mana and that the cut tree is Tronbay? Not knowing how much information they passed on to the Head Priest, I hold my tongue so that I won’t say anything unnecessary. I will ask Fran later what kind of questioning he has gone through.\n\n\n “The fact that everyone’s answers are similar probably means that it’s not wrong. But, can’t you tell me what kind of uproar you caused that managed to turn the paving stones upside down?”\n\n\n Just as I put up my guard and brace myself for an interrogation, the Head Priest scowls at me and orders,\n\n\n “Ma?ne, today you will stay in the reflection room for the whole day.”\n\n\n “Eh?”\n\n\n … Without any questioning? If it was Mister Benno, he would relentlessly interrogate me though?\n\n\n I wonder whether it’s because he went to ask the orphans about the circumstances while I was staying in bed? The Head Priest imposed my punishment without asking anything further.\n\n\n “Reflection room, is it?”\n\n\n “Correct. You should properly contemplate your own deeds while offering prayers to the gods.”\n\n\n “… Very well.”\n\n\n In sharp contrast to me, who would rather stay silent and go to reflection room to avoid being questioned, Fran became ghastly pale the instant he heard about me going to the reflection room. Delia even shouted “Unbelievable!”\n\n\n “I have never heard something like a blue-robed priestess apprentice being sent to the reflection room! That’s disgraceful!”\n\n\n “Head Priest, please reconsider sending her to the reflection room!”\n\n\n It looks like I will become the first blue-robed priestess apprentice in history to be sent to the reflection room.\n\n\n To be honest, I would choose being confined in the reflection room over being repeatedly and persistently picked at about the day of the festival while being scolded by the Head Priest with such a frosty atmosphere.\n\n\n “Both of you, it can’t be helped as I broke the promise I made with the Head Priest. It’s only natural for me to take responsibility. It’s fine as long as no blame reaches the orphanage’s children.”\n\n\n All’s well as long as the orphans, who made a fuss together with me, don’t end up being punished alongside me. It would be pitiful if their precious, happy memories were painted over by the Head Priest’s sermon and the reflection room, especially considering they enjoyed it so much.\n\n\n “Umm, Head Priest. Where can I find the reflection room and what will I be doing in there? Ah, no, don’t misunderstand. I know that I’m going to reflect on my actions. But, is there anything I have to accomplish during my reflection?”\n\n\n Various things pop into my mind from the time when I was scolded in my time as Urano, such as cleaning as punishment, writing apology letters or sitting in seiza.\n\n\n The Head Priest raises a brow and mutters “You… what are you saying?” It looks like I ended up asking something that’s common knowledge for those working at the temple.\n\n\n “It’s obvious that you are going offering prayers to the gods, isn’t it?”\n\n\n Eh? Is it a sentence of one day in the Gl○co pose?\n\n\n As I’m not saying anything against that unexpected penalty, Gil comforted me by saying “Sister Ma?ne, since I’m used to it, I will go inside together with you.” Of course he wasn’t allowed to accompany me into the reflection room and it was decided that I will enter by myself.\n\n\n “Make sure to properly contemplate in here.”\n\n\n The Head Priest led me to the reflection room, which is really close to the hall of worship and urged me inside.\n\n\n It appears to be a small room made out of white stone, just like the hall of worship, and there’s a small gap for ventilation high up on the wall. It’s a dormer window, so the small room is brighter than I expected.\n\n\n This room, that uses white stone for the floor and all the surrounding walls as well, is cold despite it being summer. It looks like it would be terrible during winter, but it doesn’t seem to be such a harsh environment in summer.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, are you alright?”\n\n\n “Yes, I’m doing fine.”\n\n\n I couldn’t see the worried looks of Fran and Gil through the hastily closed wooden door.\n\n\n Since there’s no one watching me, there’s no way that I will seriously offer my prayers. I sit down in a corner with a thump. It’s nice and cold, and has a very calming atmosphere.\n\n\n I decide to take out the assignment list that I secretly put in the pocket of my skirt and ponder how to solve the problems.\n\n\n “Yeah, won’t this be somehow possible, if he skillfully adopts a system of turning down first-time customers? What should I do about this one? It’s not a good time to shamelessly ask the Head Priest to Please invite me to dinner and lunch since I want to learn about a noble’s meals.”\n\n\n I wonder whether I’m maybe still not up to my normal condition? I’m getting too sleepy. Since my stomach’s empty, I think that the time for lunch has passed. I fold the assignment list, put it into my pocket, and then lie down on the floor. In order to restore my stamina by having a little nap, I close my eyes and let myself doze.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you’re supposed to be reflecting, not taking a nap…!? Fran!”\n\n\n “Whaa! Sister Ma?ne!?”\n\n\n It seems that my body ended up growing cold while I was taking a nap on the chilly stone floor. When the Head Priest came back to let me out of the reflection room, my fever had come back at full strength and I was unable to move.\n\n\n “To cause her fever to act up again the day she showed up at the temple after recovering, just how am I going to apologize to her mother?” I could hear Fran’s voice close to my ear. He was at his wits’ end.\n\n\n “Didn’t she recover!?”\n\n\n “With all due respect, Head Priest, you are taking Sister Ma?ne’s feebleness far too lightly. Didn’t I implore you to reconsider sending her to the reflection room?”\n\n\n “So those were words considering her physical condition and not her honor…?”\n\n\n He had ignored Fran’s warning, and it resulted in my having to stay in bed with a fever again, right after recovering. It seems the Head Priest, who had sent me to the reflection room, deeply regretted my fever as being his responsibility.\n\n\n ◆◇◆◇◆\n\n\n On my third day stuck in bed, Tuuli rushes into my bedroom.\n\n\n “It’s a disaster, Ma?ne! Ralph said that Lutz ran away from home and didn’t come back!”\n\n\n “Eeh!?”\n\n\n I reflexively try to get up, but instead collapse back into bed."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Tuuli, what’s going on? What happened? Is Lutz alright?”\n\n\n Falling back on the bed with a flop, I rapidly fire questions at her, causing her to show a troubled expression. She frowns and strokes my head soothingly.\n\n\n “Sorry, Ma?ne. I told you since your fever has subsided but… it’s bad for you to get agitated. Your fever will act up again.”\n\n\n “Tuuli, tell me.”\n\n\n I grab Tuuli’s hand and beg her incessantly until she sighs deeply and gives in.\n\n\n “… I will go call Ralph, so rest a little first. Okay?”\n\n\n Once she sees me nod, Tuuli turns around and leaves the room. I hear the sound of the door opening and closing, and the telltale click of the lock before Tuuli’s footsteps fade away. I listened to all that while lying curled up.\n\n\n Just as I’m beginning to get impatient, I hear quiet footsteps approaching. The door is unlocked and someone comes in.\n\n\n “… Ralph, what happened to Lutz?”\n\n\n Ralph, having been brought along by Tuuli, sees how I’ve been confined to my bed by my fever and sighs.\n\n\n “I was definitely expecting you to be sheltering him…”\n\n\n “I told you before, didn’t I? Ma?ne has been stuck in bed for three days. There’s no way she could know anything about Lutz running from your house last night.”\n\n\n Tuuli’s cheeks swell as she pouts.\n\n\n “I’m sorry for doubting you.” Apologizing to Tuuli, Ralph turns my way.\n\n\n ”Yesterday, Lutz was really angry at Dad when he got home, yelling Why do you have to keep standing in my way?! and I’ve endured for so long, but I can’t take it anymore. I’m leaving!”\n\n\n From Ralph’s words, I understood why Lutz had run away from home. I’m pretty sure he heard from Benno the reason why he can’t be taken along outside the city. I was a little relieved upon hearing that. Lutz is probably taking shelter at Benno’s place. Even if he isn’t officially adopted immediately, he should still be treated properly.\n\n\n “Mom was really upset but Dad said that we should just leave him alone and that he would probably be right back. We thought he’d be back as soon as he got hungry but he still hadn’t returned in the morning and even past noon…I can’t help worrying. Ma?ne, do you know where he could be?”\n\n\n The anxious feeling in my chest grew at Ralph’s words. If he’s with Benno, Lutz should be working. It would be impossible for Ralph to not know where he is.\n\n\n “If you are saying that you don’t know where he is… does it mean that Lutz hasn’t gone to work either?”\n\n\n “That is… I don’t know that guy’s workplace…”\n\n\n Ralph averts his gaze in embarrassment.\n\n\n I couldn’t believe what I was hearing for a second. Even though it’s only been about two and a half months since the coming-of-age ceremony, Lutz has been coming and going from the Gilberta Company for almost a year. It’s a shop that he frequented before becoming an apprentice.\n\n\n “You don’t know? It’s the Gilberta Company, no?”\n\n\n “… I know the name. You visited Sieg’s workshop before, didn’t you? But even Sieg doesn’t know where to find their shop.”\n\n\n “So if Lutz and I hadn’t gone to Sieg’s workshop… you probably wouldn’t know about it even now?”\n\n\n Ralph awkwardly turns away at my incredulous, verifying question. Seeing Ralph in such state, Tuuli exclaims “I can’t believe it!”\n\n\n “Wait, Ralph! You don’t know the workplace of your younger brother? Surely, you talk about work with your family, right?”\n\n\n I know that there’s a difference between how much and what men and women talk about, but this is a little excessive, isn’t it? I don’t know if it’s because they do not want to listen to Lutz’ side at all, or if they’re just indifferent, but not even knowing where to search for Lutz after he runs away is a problem. I reach out and clutch his shirt cuff.\n\n\n “… Hey, Ralph. I know it’s not any of my business but you should really talk to Lutz more.”\n\n\n “It’s Lutz who never talks! In the first place, aren’t I the one enduring? No matter how much opposition he gets from our family, he’s been doing whatever he wants! Even on his days off, he doesn’t come to the forest to help forage! Tell me, what exactly is he enduring?”\n\n\n Ralph suddenly glares at me, slapping my hand away as he shouted out.\n\n\n “Ralph, don’t be rough with Ma?ne! Her fever still hasn’t gone down!”\n\n\n “S-, sorry…”\n\n\n Well aware that I have been monopolizing Lutz’s days off, I back him up while thinking Don’t give me a headache with your loud voice!\n\n\n “Isn’t Lutz working on his days off? Whether he’s summoned by Benno or working for me, he always gets paid, right? It’s not like he’s playing around.”\n\n\n It really seems like there’s almost no conversation between them at all. Eyes widening in surprise, Ralph lightly shakes his head.\n\n\n “… I didn’t know that.”\n\n\n It looks like conversation has been stilted due to the tensions in the house, but Ralph is genuinely worried about Lutz not coming home. There’s no doubt about that. And ultimately the one that has to talk to Ralph is Lutz, not me.\n\n\n “Tuuli.”\n\n\n I look up at Tuuli. Given that she had gone to buy clothes with me, Tuuli has met not only Benno but also several of his employees. Having her go with Ralph would probably be better than him suddenly barging in all by himself.\n\n\n “Please take Ralph to the Gilberta Company. It’s fine if he still doesn’t want to go home as long as he’s okay. Can you just go and check if he’s safe? Please.”\n\n\n “I’m worried about Lutz as well, so I hope it all works out. Let’s go, Ralph.”\n\n\n Ralph glances back over his shoulder as Tuuli grabs his hand and leads him out of the room, looking like he’s worried about my condition. I can only respond with a powerless smile.\n\n\n Ralph has always been the big brother who takes care of others. Even now he’s worrying about Lutz, even though he resents how Lutz has been doing as he pleases.\n\n\n Although neither Lutz nor Ralph fundamentally hates the other, the relationship between the two brothers has soured. I close my eyes and hope that Ralph can have a proper conversation with Lutz once he sees Lutz’ situation with his own eyes.\n\n\n The sun is setting when I wake up. From the window, a bright beam of light is shining directly on my face.\n\n\n It seems like Tuuli has already returned from Benno’s store. I hear the sounds of her preparing dinner from the kitchen. I’m thirsty, so I pick up the wooden cup and quench my thirst. As if she can sense me moving, Tuuli pops her head around the open door.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, are you awake? Do you think you will be able to eat?”\n\n\n Once I nod and sit up with a rustle, Tuuli brings a bread gruel to the bed. While I tuck in, Tuuli tells me what happened after they headed to the store.\n\n\n “Lutz was present at the store and doing his job properly. He looked fine.”\n\n\n “I see. That’s good.”\n\n\n I’m relieved that the worst-case scenario of him getting involved in trouble after leaving his home or being turned away by Benno hasn’t occurred.\n\n\n “When he found Lutz, Ralph told him to come home quickly and tried to bring him back by force. Lutz told him that he was bothering him in the middle of work and it turned into a dispute. Ralph got angry and left after shouting “to hell with you!”… Ralph’s dad was at work as well, and it seems like he told Ralph to leave Lutz alone.”\n\n\n I feel my heart constrict as I see the small crack in Lutz’ family widening into a chasm that cannot be fixed.\n\n\n “I understand that you are worried, but Ma?ne, if you don’t get better quickly, you won’t be able to go visit him either, right?”\n\n\n “… Yeah.”\n\n\n ◆◇◆◇◆\n\n\n It was Gil rather than Lutz who came to pick me up the next day. It seems Lutz told him to act as his substitute for a while. Although he made the effort to get me, I can’t go to the temple since my fever hasn’t subsided yet.\n\n\n Watching me as I lay on the bed, Gil worriedly peers at my face.\n\n\n “Sister Ma?ne, your fever still hasn’t gone down?”\n\n\n “Yeah. Since I will have to monitor my condition for a day even after it goes down, can you come again in three days?”\n\n\n Gil nods anxiously, and kneels by my bedside, grabbing my right hand and lowering his head as if kissing the back of my hand. Gil presses his forehead against the back of my hand and begins to pray.\n\n\n “I pray for Sister Ma?ne to receive the divine protection of the Goddess of Healing, Lungschummel.”\n\n\n “Thank you. I pray that you also receive the gods’ blessing, Gil.”\n\n\n Gil went back with a painfully reluctant expression and, as promised, came to pick me up again three days later.\n\n\n Because my fever has gone down and I finally have my family’s permission to go outside, I leave with Gil. Lutz’s absence feels weird somehow and I can’t settle down.\n\n\n Once we descend the stairs and leave the building, I spot Lutz’ mother, Aunt Karla, doing the laundry by the well. I run up to her and ask,\n\n\n “Aunt Karla, has Lutz still not come back?”\n\n\n Aunt Karla shakes her head silently. The appearance of a cheerful, chatty old lady with startling intensity and a fine physique is gone. Now she looks haggard.\n\n\n “Ma?ne… do you know about Lutz’s circumstances?”\n\n\n “I heard about it from Ralph and Tuuli, but I had to stay in bed the whole time because of my fever. I had planned to go to the store today and see Lutz’ situation, but…”\n\n\n “I see. Can you tell me if he’s okay?”\n\n\n “Yes, I can check on him.”\n\n\n I agree, thinking that it would have been fine if she had gone to visit him by herself, given the circumstances. Gil and I leave the square.\n\n\n “Gil, I want to check on Lutz, so please stop by the store, okay?”\n\n\n “It’s fine as long as it’s a place you want to go to, Sister Ma?ne. I mean, it will be alright even without that old lady worrying so much, won’t it? One can survive without parents. There are no parents at the orphanage.”\n\n\n “… I guess that’s true.”\n\n\n When I stepped into the orphanage for the first time, I fully grasped the meaning of children being unwanted. That’s because the orphans, who were living without any parents, must have thought that it would be alright even if they didn’t exist, feeling as if they shouldn’t be alive.\n\n\n Once we arrive at the Gilberta Company, we are greeted with a broad smile by Mark. Behind him, Lutz is recording something on a writing board.\n\n\n “Good morning, Ma?ne. Is your physical condition alright now?”\n\n\n “Good morning, Mark. My fever has finally subsided. Rather than that, I heard that Lutz ran away from home…”\n\n\n “Please, let’s take that inside, okay? A few days ago, people concerned with Lutz have disturbed the store and even the employees are slightly worked up.”\n\n\n Mark had interrupted my speech with a gentle smile as he spoke. It seems there were others besides Ralph who showed up at the store and tried to take Lutz back home.\n\n\n If poor people, who don’t care about their attire, turn up at a store that deals with sales of high class and quality goods for noble business partners and kick up a fuss, it will likely give the store a bad image. If it goes on like this, Lutz’ position will get worse as well. I hold my tongue and nod.\n\n\n “Master, it looks like Ma?ne wishes to speak with Lutz, so we will go this way, alright?”\n\n\n “… You do remember that this is a lounge and not a counseling room, right Mark?”\n\n\n “I have taken that into account.”\n\n\n He’s smiling, but Benno acknowledges it with a sigh after being overwhelmed by Mark’s uncompromising aura.\n\n\n “Excuse me, Mister Benno. Although it would also be fine if we went outside…”\n\n\n “No, talk inside. Last night Lutz’ mother came to my house instead of the store and went on a tirade about how we have to return Lutz right away and that we are kidnappers, you know? Mark got angry and turned her away.”\n\n\n “I’m sorry, master.”\n\n\n Imagining how Aunt Karla must have yelled at them with her usual intensity, I felt dejected. Immediately following that, I shudder at hearing that Mark had snapped at her. For him to be able to turn away Aunt Karla, just what had happened? I wonder if the reason why she looks so exhausted as if she’s become another person entirely might be because of this?\n\n\n Having a hunch that it’s better if I don’t ask about the details, I turn to face Lutz.\n\n\n “Lutz, how is it going right now? Are you are staying at Mister Benno’s place?”\n\n\n “Even if you ask me how… I’m living in the attic after taking my luggage there? That’s why I didn’t know about mum until this morning…”\n\n\n Aunt Karla was apparently chased away without being able to meet with Lutz. Now that I understand the reason she wanted me to check on his situation, I have complicated feelings.\n\n\n “… you say. Wait? The attic?”\n\n\n “I mean, there’s no other place for me to stay besides there, right?”\n\n\n Lutz said that he’s living in the attic that was used as a storeroom. That’s the treatment of a live-in apprentice. Benno, who did say that he’s considering to adopt him, has decided not to give him any additional support.\n\n\n “What’s this about, Mister Benno!? Didn’t you want to adopt Lutz!?”\n\n\n “… Me adopted by master? Huh? What are you talking about?”\n\n\n Guessing from the look of the bewildered Lutz, it appears that Benno hasn’t told Lutz anything.\n\n\n Sending a glare my way, Benno looks down on me with eyes full of fury. “You idiot!”\n\n\n “Even if I want to adopt him, there’s no way that I can arbitrarily adopt him legally without the permission of his parents. This is a path chosen by Lutz after I explained the circumstances to him. Putting that aside, how many times have I told you to stop speaking without using your brain!? Don’t spout off talking about adoption in a situation where it’s not possible to get the parents’ approval, like a moron!”\n\n\n “… Ah.”\n\n\n Damn it, even if I hold my tongue now, it’s already too late.\n\n\n Lutz’ eyes lose their luster. The difficulties of living alone have likely been weighing on him since he ran away. Lutz’s eyes, usually full of hope for the future, become hard as he finds a target for his frustration.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you knew about this?”\n\n\n Benno interjects. “I talked to her. For the sake of obtaining information about your parents and your home life, okay?”\n\n\n “Master…”\n\n\n Lutz’ eyes waver slightly due to Benno’s words. Lutz looks at me with eyes similar to those of a lost child who’s looking for his own place in this world.\n\n\n “But, if that’s so… if you knew, why didn’t you tell me?”\n\n\n “Because I thought you would act like this, Lutz. Turning your back on your family…I didn’t want to break your family apart since mine means so much to me.”\n\n\n I didn’t want to do something like wrecking Lutz’ family, but even so, I believed that if Benno could take Lutz in… if he could adopt him, it would be fine as long as he first made sure it was Lutz’ choice.\n\n\n I thought that, if Benno was with him, it would be unlikely to turn into a situation where Lutz would have to endure the cruel life of a live-in apprentice until adulthood, when only then he could finally be able to move free of his parents meddling. However, the reality of the situation is that Lutz is now a runaway, living in the attic as a live-in apprentice, and he is unable to be adopted without his parents’ permission. After a mere five days of this, Lutz’s eyes have lost their usual luster.\n\n\n “Are you also saying that it’s my fault, Ma?ne? My fault for running away…”\n\n\n His family probably said the same things as Ralph, Don’t be selfish and come back home! Don’t do whatever you like! The one causing trouble for the store is you! Haven’t you had enough of this already!? I heard from Tuuli that Ralph had told Lutz things like that.\n\n\n If Lutz apologizes and goes back home, he should be able to live like before again. But he would be told Look, we told you so, something like being a live-in apprentice was impossible for you after all, and his determination would be reduced to selfishness. He would be able to live, but not only would he be suppressed, he wouldn’t be able to say anything either.\n\n\n I don’t want to see such a thing happen to Lutz, so I deny it right away.\n\n\n “I never said it was your fault, Lutz. There’s no way I would say that, is there? I know how much effort you are putting into this, Lutz. I also know what you have been enduring all this time.”\n\n\n “I see…”\n\n\n Relieved, Lutz breathes out a bit. Meeting his jade-green eyes, I continue.\n\n\n “No matter what happens, I’m your ally, Lutz. I’m here right now because you told me that I was fine just as I am.”\n\n\n I know how it feels to shut yourself away and feel like you have no real allies around you. I didn’t feel like I had a place I belonged, and had been suffering under that. The one who changed that, telling me It’s okay if you’re my Ma?ne, was Lutz. If only I could give Lutz a little of the sense of that same security I had received from his words.\n\n\n “That’s why I will tell you as well. Lutz, it’s fine if you stay as you are. I will always support you. I will help you with all my power, just like you helped me, so depend on me when it gets tough.”\n\n\n Lutz hugs me with a teary smile.\n\n\n “Haha… What an unreliable ally. It looks to me like you will get crushed before I can depend on you.”\n\n\n I am almost crushed in Lutz’s arms with that declaration, as I tap sullenly on Lutz’s back.\n\n\n “… I can help at least a little.”\n\n\n “With what for example?”\n\n\n I can hear him sniffing close to my ear. Nonetheless, it feels like Lutz’ voice has become a lot brighter.\n\n\n “Are you going to eat lunch together with me…? Since there’s no kitchen in the attic, you can’t make any meals, right?”\n\n\n “… Telling me to eat with you, it’s not like you are the one making it, Ma?ne.”\n\n\n “That will be a big help, Milady; that is what you were about to say, right?” I gently whisper.\n\n\n Lutz lifts his head and chuckles. I’m relieved that his usual, positive smile has returned. Maybe I’ve helped Lutz a little.\n\n\n “… Hey, are you done now?”\n\n\n Benno calls out to us with an exasperated expression, resting his chin on his hands as he props his elbows on the desk. I tilt my head to the side while patting Lutz’ back.\n\n\n “… It’s fine, but what do you mean?”\n\n\n “Well, if you are satisfied, return to your work.”\n\n\n Lutz separates from me in a hurry and leaves the room after Benno waves his hand and says “Disappear at once.”\n\n\n As I try to politely disappear as well, Benno starts talking while still staring after Lutz.\n\n\n ”Ma?ne, I understand your feelings of wanting to handle this situation as soon as possible, but from the looks of it the matter, adoption will have to wait. Given his mother’s threatening attitude yesterday, there won’t be any room to discuss it unless they calm down. “\n\n\n Benno’s words, coldly logical despite the circumstances, make me feel like I’ve swallowed something bitter and there’s a lump in my throat.\n\n\n “It looks like he will have to live like this for a while, so even if he can bear it now, it will take a toll on him if his quality of living drops any further. In my current situation I can’t interfere since it will also affect the reputation of the store. Imagine if we are accused of kidnapping, tricking him and whatever else Lutz’s family might say. If you say that you are Lutz’ ally, then help him as much as possible.”\n\n\n “… Yes.”\n\n\n Even if he leaves home, Lutz should be able to fully devote himself to his work once he becomes Benno’s adopted child. He should be able to fulfill his own dream of going outside the city to build a workshop for producing paper.\n\n\n It’s troublesome if it’s something like becoming a live-in apprentice and suffering more hardships than he has already…\n\n\n Just as Benno says, if Lutz continues such a harsh life, he will likely fall apart. It might result in him resenting his family for not accepting it, and he might blame himself.\n\n\n I wonder if there is anything I can do for him, just like when he supported me. Unable to come up with a single reasonable method, I sigh heavily."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “… Mmh. … Ma?ne. Hey, are you listening?”\n\n\n The Head Priest shakes me by my shoulder, startling me back to attention. He rubs his temples and taps on my slate while looking down.\n\n\n “It looks like we aren’t making any progress at all, doesn’t it?”\n\n\n “Ah, I’m very sorry.”\n\n\n I apologize and resume calculating. Once I reach a point in the calculations where I can pause, I cease the scraping of my slate pencil and heave a sigh.\n\n\n … What to do about Lutz?\n\n\n Lutz is managing somehow since running away from home, but it would be best if, after an earnest discussion with his family, they could reconcile. If they don’t have an open discussion, they’ll end up hiding the things they want to say and only speaking at cross purposes when they do talk.\n\n\n As I’ve been blessed with a good family, it is difficult for me to accept this situation, but if staying with his family is too painful for Lutz, it may be better for them to separate. It’s a difficult situation.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, your hands have stopped.”\n\n\n “Eh? Ah, this is done.”\n\n\n “Then, this…”\n\n\n “Yes.”\n\n\n If it’s only about resolving the current situation, the simplest solution would be for Benno to adopt him. Lutz would be able to devote himself to his work, and he would also gain a strong backer in matters concerning his career. Even the practical side of his life would have no worries. However, without permission from his parents, adoption is impossible, and Benno says he won’t interfere this time.\n\n\n I thought about preparing a place for discussion, calling Lutz, his family, and Benno together and have them talk it out properly, but I don’t believe that I will be able to gather everyone even if I said: “Let’s have an honest talk.”\n\n\n I also think it would be difficult to reign in Benno and Lutz’ father if the discussion became heated and they began to quarrel. No matter how I thought about it, I couldn’t see a future where it would change for the better.\n\n\n “… I’m really totally useless…”\n\n\n “It’s as you say. You’re completely correct there.”\n\n\n “Eh?”\n\n\n Surprised at the Head Priests sudden comment, I look up to see him jerking his chin towards the bed.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, come over here.”\n\n\n “Umm, Head Priest, will the work be alright?”\n\n\n “Your work as calculator can wait. Come.”\n\n\n “… Okay.”\n\n\n While grumbling “Isn’t it too mean to call me a calculator?”, I follow the Head Priest and enter the room.\n\n\n I take a seat at the edge of a couch and take a quick glance at the various objects that are usually inside the room.\n\n\n The Head Priest brings his own chair, sits down on it with an irritated whomp and glares at me. Given that the Head Priest more opening shows his emotions here, the glint in his eyes is about two times sharper than before. \n\n “Just what are you brooding about? It seems like you have only breathed out depressed sighs for most of the session.”\n\n\n “… It’s something completely unrelated to you, Head Priest. I’m sorry. I will try to do a bit better.”\n\n\n Worrying about Lutz, I don’t focus on the work. What should I say, it looks like the sermon will be a long one. Once I try to keep the preaching short by showing that I’m reflecting, the Head Priest places his elbow on the armrest of the chair, rests his chin in his hand and gives me an annoyed stare.\n\n\n “Seeing that it delays the performance of your official duties, it’s not totally unrelated.”\n\n\n I have to fully agree with you. I slowly avert my look from his golden eyes which were slightly narrowed. Having been been accused of talking without thinking, it’s better for me to talk as little as possible.\n\n\n When I hold my tongue, the Head Priest gets up and stands before me with a sigh, and then pinches my cheek with a twist.\n\n\n “Tell me properly. If you act ambiguous and long-winded like a child, the official duties I care about will likely make no progress.”\n\n\n I had imagined he only saw me as a convenient calculator, but it seems he’s concerned about me. I intently look up at the roundabout, incomprehensible Head Priest.\n\n\n Which reminds me, the Head Priest is someone who received education as noble. I heard that many of the temple’s nobles moved away due to adoption and marriage after the number of nobles fell because of the political purge, but I wonder whether the Head Priest is well informed about adoption.\n\n\n “Head Priest, do you know of a method to adopt someone without getting the permission of the parents?”\n\n\n The Head Priest raised one of his eyebrows lightly, as if surprised, due to my question.\n\n\n “What? Do you even have the determination to be apart from that family?”\n\n\n “It’s not about me!”\n\n\n Because of the Head Priest’s startling remark, I unintentionally forgot to speak with proper respect, but the Head Priest just quietly mutters “As expected.” Fixing his posture on his chair, he places his elbows on the armrests and links his fingers in front of his stomach.\n\n\n “… Who are you talking about then? Depending on the situation, it may be possible.”\n\n\n “There is a way?”\n\n\n I spontaneously get up, but the Head Priest waves his hand as if telling me to reseat myself and nods to my question.\n\n\n “As I hold a bit of authority, there are some methods. Though you will have to let me investigate the other party before I will exercise my authority.”\n\n\n “It’s the adoption of Lutz by Benno.”\n\n\n I could see a faint hope to improve Lutz’ current situation. I stare at the Head Priest with eyes full of expectation while reseating myself.\n\n\n “I suppose both are important people to you? … Tell me the details.”\n\n\n I told the Head Priest a simple outline and as I answered his questions, one by one, it resulted in a detailed recount of the circumstances.\n\n\n The Head Priest, who apparently questioned me until satisfied, closed his eyes and quietly sorted the information before slowly opening his eyes.\n\n\n “Hmm. So Lutz ran away from home harboring unhappiness with how his family treats him after running into their resistance to becoming a merchant’s apprentice and also to go outside the city for his work from now on. Benno wants to adopt Lutz who shows a promising future, but that’s also being opposed by his parents. Wanting to do something about Lutz’ living environment is your biggest wish, and the best case would be for Lutz to reconcile with his family. You believe that the fastest method would be for Benno to adopt him. Anything wrong with what I’ve said up to here?”\n\n\n “No.”\n\n\n For him to accurately summarize the information he memorized without even having taken any notes; I wonder, doesn’t that mean that the Head Priest possesses an excellent memory in fact? As I’m admiring him for something weird, the Head Priest continues even further,\n\n\n “His father has said to leave Lutz, who ran away from home, alone if he’s doing his work, didn’t he? He hasn’t said anything along the lines of ‘Go away’ or ‘Don’t come back’, has he?”\n\n\n “… Probably, since I’ve only heard it from Tuuli, I don’t know for sure either.”\n\n\n Indeed, what I realized based on the Head Priest’s explanation just now is that I don’t know anything besides hearsay about Lutz’ parents’ opinion. I talked with Lutz and also listened to Benno’s opinion. But, I never heard anything about Lutz’ parents except for the things that Lutz, Ralph, and Tuuli told me.\n\n\n “… Situationally it’s a slightly weak argumentation, but it’s possible for Lutz to be adopted if he’s treated as child, who was put into the care of the orphanage after being abandoned by his parents, allowing the orphanage director to sign as foster parent if Benno were to request that he wants to take custody of the orphan.”\n\n\n “Eeh!? The orphanage director; that’s me, no!? Then I have to immediately take in Lutz at the orphanage…”\n\n\n Amazing me! It’s great that I took up the job of the orphanage director!\n\n\n Once I get up with a clamoring while being exhilarated, the Head Priest once again waves his hand telling me to sit back down.\n\n\n “Wait. Ma?ne, make sure to listen to things until the end. Isn’t jumping to conclusions or not listening properly the reason for many of your blunders?”\n\n\n “…”\n\n\n Having that pointed out very calmly I reseat myself without even uttering a single complaint. Umm… I feel like the Head Priest is steadily getting a better grasp on my personality.\n\n\n “Even though you have assumed the official position of orphanage director, you are still a minor. Just your signing is insufficient for carrying out an adoption.”\n\n\n “… So what should I do if someone, who really wants to adopt an orphan, turned up?”\n\n\n For my autograph to be useless even though I’m the director of the orphanage…\n\n\n I slump my shoulders dejectedly, but I calmly concluded in a corner of my mind that there’s no way for me as a child, who’s at an age where I can’t do anything without my guardians being present, to bear such a responsibility.\n\n\n “Seeing as it can’t be done by you, it becomes necessary for me, who is your superior, to do the signing.”\n\n\n “Head Priest, I beg you. Please sign Lutz’ adoption.”\n\n\n When I requested that of the Head Priest, he breathed out slowly.\n\n\n “It doesn’t mean that I won’t sign it. But, the points you’ve raised just now are all things you were told by Lutz, who is a child himself. I can’t decide that he was abandoned by his parents just because I was told so by a child. Before taking him into the care of the orphanage as a child who was abandoned by his parents, I’d like to listen to his parents’ side.”\n\n\n “Huh? Umm, how?”\n\n\n Even if I’m simply told that he wants to speak with them, I don’t know what would be the best method to arrange that. The head Priest stares at the confused me with a look as if seeing something strange.\n\n\n “How, you ask? If I want to speak to someone, I just have to summon them, don’t I? Just what are you talking about?”\n\n\n “… What a splendid display of authoritarian power in front of my eyes.”\n\n\n If they want to have a talk, they only have to summon the other party. That’s the common sense of the temple. Remembering the time when my parents received a written invitation and were summoned, I drop my shoulders. Just what the heck have I been doing to worry whether I won’t be able to set up a place for a discussion.\n\n\n “Everything will be cleared in front of me as witness, and if I can agree with it, I will support Lutz’ adoption by Benno.”\n\n\n “Thank you very much.”\n\n\n I lift my face in a bright mood.\n\n\n For a change, the Head Priest was smiling. But, that smile had nothing refreshing to it and felt like the grins when he came up with something slightly evil.\n\n\n “For that sake, you have to make an effort to perform your official duties in the afternoon as well. The library room will have to wait.”\n\n\n “… Hah?”\n\n\n When I’m feeling overcome with surprise, the Head Priest squinted his eyes while looking even happier.\n\n\n “I heard from Fran. That it is more effective against you than the reflection room.”\n\n\n “Gaahh!?”\n\n\n … Fran you stupid idiot!\n\n\n I tearfully strived in my duties throughout the afternoon and got the Head Priest to write up the written invitations as promised, one for Lutz, Benno and Lutz’ parents each.\n\n\n “Give these to me.”\n\n\n I received the wooden tags, necessary for improving Lutz’ situation even if it’s only a bit, with a smile plastered all over my face.\n\n\n ◆◇◆◇◆\n\n\n Given that Lutz stopped picking me up, I go back home together with Fran. That’s because it won’t be seen as anything but a child’s errand if I went with Gil, despite having been given the written invitation by the Head Priest. If it’s the adult Fran, even Lutz’ parents will likely accept the invitation seriously.\n\n\n “Let’s go and give them to Lutz and Mister Benno then.”\n\n\n Being urged on by Fran, I made a short visit to the Gilberta Company. I have Mark lead us to the inner room and also have him call Lutz.\n\n\n “Mister Benno~, praise me, praise me. Look at this!”\n\n\n Running up to Benno with a bouncy stride, I hold out the wooden card with a triumphal look. Just after Benno briefly scans the wooden card with a puzzled look, his expression transforms and he has a fit of anger.\n\n\n “… A written invitation by the Head Priest!? You, just what did you do this time!?”\n\n\n “Umm, that is, it turned out like this after I consulted with the Head Priest regarding Lutz’ running away from home and a bypass for the adoption?”\n\n\n Since I had a feeling that I accomplished something beneficial this time, I tilt my head to the side and blink my eyes in confusion due to being suddenly confronted with his anger.\n\n\n “Just what have you done!?”\n\n\n “Eh? Huh? What’s wrong about it?”\n\n\n “Don’t get a noble involved in such issues! You don’t know to what conclusion it might lead!”\n\n\n Benno is enraged, but I don’t get the reason at all. The Head Priest is undoubtedly a noble, but he will understand if you talk with him. And, although it’s difficult to understand as he’s roundabout about it, he was only worried about me.\n\n\n “I mean, the Head Priest said that it can’t be helped since it’s for the sake of taking care of his calculator… besides, I wanted to do something for Lutz.”\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you know, I appreciate your feelings. But, usually, I’m afraid if I receive such written invitation.”\n\n\n Lutz looks at the written invitation he was given and hangs his head crestfallen. Benno also hangs his head in the same way while being at his wits’ end.\n\n\n “A written invitation from the Head Priest once you made a move for the sake of Lutz, huh…?” Benno sighs.\n\n\n “I mean, Mister Benno, you told me that you can’t make a move yourself this time. So I just consulted with an adult close to me.”\n\n\n Pursing his lips with a groan, Benno glares at me with his reddish-brown eyes that have a ferocious light dwelling within.\n\n\n “I see. Meaning, it wouldn’t have turned out like this, if I had advanced the adoption, even if it had to be forcefully, by threatening Lutz’ parents and using my full power…?”\n\n\n “What scary stuff are you talking about!?”\n\n\n “… Ma?ne, if master really wants to do so, he’s capable of at least this much. My family caused trouble for the store. You understand even without pondering who is stronger between my parents and master, right?”\n\n\n I was taken aback by Lutz’ words. I have been carefreely coming and going to the Gilberta Company, but Tuuli did say that she feels nervous by just going to the northern side of the city. She ought to have clearly felt the difference to our usual sphere of daily life at first.\n\n\n Even when Aunt Karla came to directly demand Lutz to be returned, it was probably an act that took quite the courage. Lutz’ family, who bothered the store, not receiving any punishment is owed to them being forgiven leniently by Benno.\n\n\n “Just when I was planning to let it end peacefully for the sake of Lutz, you are…”\n\n\n “Even the Head Priest is peaceful! He also gave proper thought about a method to adopt Lutz.”\n\n\n “What?”\n\n\n “Seriously!?”\n\n\n Benno and Lutz looked my way. I nod and explain the method I was told by the Head Priest to both of them.\n\n\n “With the fact of having been discarded by his parents, Lutz will go to the orphanage and ask for shelter. If it’s a situation where you, Mister Benno, decided to take care of Lutz, who is an orphan at that time, the adoption will be valid with the orphanage’s and your autograph, Mister Benno…”\n\n\n “The orphanage director is you, huh?”\n\n\n Benno looked at me while grinning broadly. Although I feel bad about having given him expectations, my signing has no value.\n\n\n “As I’m a child, it’s the Head Priest who has to sign it. That’s why he wants to speak with Lutz’ parents and decide based on the circumstances he’s told. The written invitation is for that.”\n\n\n Benno looks at the wooden card he still held in his hand and slowly strokes his chin while frowning.\n\n\n “Aren’t you favored quite a bit by the Head Priest? Normally a noble won’t concern themselves with our matters.”\n\n\n “It looks like I’m an important calculator for him. It seems that the work efficiency changes depending on whether I function or not.”\n\n\n “Now that you mention it, Otto said something along those lines as well, didn’t he? This time I should probably thank you Ma?ne, but I don’t really want to. I wonder, what is this feeling of a wasted effort…”\n\n\n Benno sighs as if worn-out and roughly scratches his head.\n\n\n “You will pass the invitation to Lutz’ parents.”\n\n\n “Yes.”\n\n\n “I’m sorry, Ma?ne.”\n\n\n “No, it’s okay. I was supposed to go to report to Aunt Karla anyway. But, you know, since the setting is that you went to the orphanage with the claim that you were abandoned by your parents, go to the orphanage tomorrow, okay?”\n\n\n “Make sure to do so,” I wave my hand to Lutz and leave the store, going back home together with Fran.\n\n\n When I planned to head to Lutz’ home, I caught sight of Aunt Karla loitering around at the water well’s plaza.\n\n\n “Aunt Karla!”\n\n\n Being called by me, Aunt Karla raises her head as if being snapped up, and came running over. Her round face has become haggard and thin, and the area around her eyes seems to have sunken in slightly.\n\n\n “Ma?ne, you are late. Did you meet Lutz? In what kind of situation is he?”\n\n\n “He’s seriously doing his job. He looks happy.”\n\n\n “I see.”\n\n\n The feeling of her being worried about Lutz was painfully clear from Aunt Karla breathing out in relief. It might be obvious that she won’t accept the adoption readily.\n\n\n “Aunty, look, this here is a written invitation from the temple’s Head Priest.”\n\n\n I take out the wooden card and hold it out to Aunt Karla. Karla opens her eyes widely in disbelief and looks at the wooden card with a ghastly pale face.\n\n\n “… Come again? From the temple?”\n\n\n “Lutz requested shelter at the orphanage, saying that he was discarded by his parents.”\n\n\n “Isn’t the one who left on his own accord that child!?”\n\n\n Obviously startled, Aunt Karla yelled, but even if she shouts here, the written invitation won’t disappear. The invitation from the Head Priest, a noble, is absolute.\n\n\n “Accordingly the Head Priest says that he wants to talk with his parents to decide whether he should really be sheltered at the orphanage… Uncle and Aunty, both of you have to come. Because you probably have to arrange your absence from work, it’s been set to three days later. He said that he’d like you to come to the temple on the third bell in three days.”\n\n\n I explain the details of the invitation to Aunt Karla who can’t read. Aunt Karla looked back at me while tightly grasping the wooden card I’m still holding out to her.\n\n\n “… The third bell in three days, correct?”\n\n\n “Yes. If you show this wooden card the gatekeeper will guide you in.”\n\n\n ◆◇◆◇◆\n\n\n Three days later I greeted the day of the meeting while fidgeting.\n\n\n I head to the temple earlier than usual, change into my blue robe and go to the Head Priest’s room. Lutz, who stayed with my attendants, is with me while wearing his apprentice clothes. For Lutz to have stayed in my attendant’s quarters is because I was told by the Head Priest that it might result in the other orphans harboring futile expectations, if they can see Lutz leaving into adoption.\n\n\n “I’m incredibly nervous, you know?\n\n\n “… It’s far too grandiose for a family council, isn’t it?”\n\n\n Me and Lutz entering the Head Priest’s room was apparently after he received the information that Benno and Mark had arrived. Both of them immediately turned up after being guided by a grey-robed priest to the Head Priest’s room.\n\n\n After Benno finished the endless-feeling, long-winded greetings for a noble, Lutz’ parents arrived.\n\n\n Having heard that he has a work related to construction, the body of Lutz’ father isn’t that large, but it looks muscular. He had the appearance of a worker who toils outside while often getting sunburnt. What’s really well showing his stubborn character are the wrinkles, which were carved into his forehead, and his jade eyes that felt glaring. Thanks to his blonde hair that seems to be close to white, he slightly looks like someone who has lived through many years.\n\n\n Lutz’ father looks at Lutz for an instant, and after snorting with a “Humph,” he gave a simple greeting to the Head Priest. At the time when Lutz’ parents sit down on the offered chairs, Aunt Karla become startled after seeing Benno and Mark, who are sitting in the seats in front of her.\n\n\n Mister Mark, seriously, what did you do? What did you tell her? Those are the marks of him already having threatened her, aren’t they?\n\n\n At the moment everyone assembled in the Head Priest’s room, the third bell resounded loudly."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n While the Head Priest gave his greetings next to me, I observed the small magic tool in my hand. The magic tool prevents eavesdropping by only allowing designated people to hear the speaker’s voice. In today’s meeting it will be used to make sure that my voice can only be heard by the Head Priest.\n\n\n In short, the Head Priest’s wants me to stay silent and avoid saying anything unnecessary.\n\n\n When I complained that I want to back up Lutz I was told, “I have to learn the intentions and motives of the related parties in detail. If an outsider interjects, it will only lead to confusion. Especially as you are Lutz’ ally and therefore biased. Your comments would only be bothersome.”\n\n\n His rebuke was so direct that I nearly replied “What happened to your usual roundabout way of speaking?”\n\n\n The condition for me to attend today’s meeting was that I hold the magic tool, so all I can do is sit still like a doll. To my irritation, Benno and Mark agreed with the Head Priest’s opinion.\n\n\n The chairs are arranged around a square table in the middle of the room. The Head Priest and I take the seats furthest from the door. Lutz sits across from us with Benno and Mark sitting on the right and Lutz’ parents on the left side.\n\n\n After the greetings and simple introductions, the Head Priest plainly states Lutz’ case. As the Head Priest directly asked Lutz about it, other incidents at his home even I didn’t know about were revealed.\n\n\n “… These are Lutz’ grievances. Is everything correct, Lutz?”\n\n\n “Yes.”\n\n\n Lutz nods to the Head Priest as he answers, and watches his parents for a reaction.\n\n\n I silently root for Lutz with all my might.\n\n\n Tightly grasping his slightly trembling fists, Lutz says,\n\n\n “No matter how hard I work, I can’t get their approval. My wishes are completely rejected by dad…” (Lutz)\n\n\n “Don’t be so naive!”\n\n\n Lutz’ father, Uncle Dido, roars at Lutz, tightly grasping his knees.\n\n\n The abrupt yell made me jump in my seat. Usually he gives instructions to the workers and thus he’s probably accustomed to speaking in such a loud voice. Startled, my heart freezes at his deep loud voice that seems to not only reverberate through the Head Priest’s room, but also the noble’s area.\n\n\n Scary! I got really frightened! That’s bad for my heart!\n\n\n However, it looks like it wasn’t just me who had their heart frozen. The faces of everyone present stiffen and they all look at Uncle Dido simultaneously.\n\n\n I have often experienced Benno’s wrath, but it’s remarkably different in volume and intensity to that of Uncle Dido who’s always raising his voice outside.\n\n\n “Worked hard? Can’t get our approval? Don’t say such naive things.”\n\n\n He suddenly hunches forward with a grim expression, turning his face towards Lutz. He glares at Lutz with fierce uncompromising expression. Even though there isn’t anger in his words, his deep, gruff voice is terrifying even when heard from the sidelines.\n\n\n Lutz, pale from being yelled at in front of everyone, has his teeth clenched desperately, looking like he’s about to burst into tears. I grit my teeth as well, unable to even call out to him. The Head Priest stands up from his place beside me.\n\n\n In sharp contrast to Uncle Dido’s throaty, loud voice, he calmly asks in a firm, low voice,\n\n\n “Dido, you told him to not be naive, but what do you mean by that? Explain yourself.”\n\n\n “What? Me telling him to not be naive? Isn’t it obvious from what he’s saying?”\n\n\n Uncle Dido folds his arms and tilts his head incomprehensibly. He visibly parses the comment repeatedly in his head.\n\n\n “You said “Don’t be naive” to Lutz who’s claiming in frustration that he can’t get any recognition although he’s doing his best, but I’m not able to grasp how he’s acting naively. Is it because the common sense of the lower city and the craftsmen is estranged? Explain it to me in a way that I can understand.”\n\n\n “Oh, so you don’t understand? … Explain, explain… how annoying.”\n\n\n He can’t just shut down the discussion by asking “Why don’t you understand?”, like he could if it were just Lutz rather than a noble. He probably does his work with the same short, gruff demeanor. Uncle Dido frowns and pauses, looking for the right words.\n\n\n “It’s a job he took while fighting us. Obviously he has to work hard. The season hasn’t even changed since his baptismal ceremony, is there even anything to acknowledge? The one who idiotically jumped into a job without having a single backer was my stupid son there. Even if he tries till he coughs blood, he doesn’t even know if he can continue this job into adulthood…you get it now?\n\n\n “Yes, I believe I understand. From your perspective, Lutz’s actions may indeed appear to be naive. Lutz, were you able to understand as well?”\n\n\n Lutz swallows down his words after hearing what Uncle Dido had to say, grits his teeth with a mortified expression, and casts his eyes down. On the other hand, Uncle Dido looks relieved that the Head Priest understands his stance.\n\n\n Even though this was originally a meeting to make use of the Head Priest’s social status as a noble, when I listen properly to the details, I realise that Uncle Dido has some good points. It’s just that I didn’t know as I only listened to what Lutz was saying.\n\n\n “Lutz, you have no objection? May I take this to mean that you acknowledge Dido’s opinion as correct?”\n\n\n At the Head Priest’s gentle urging, Lutz slowly lifts his head to gaze at his parents.\n\n\n “I’m not saying that I want them to recognise my accomplishments. It would be… It would be fine if they at least approved of me becoming a merchant apprentice, no!?”\n\n\n “… I did tell you to have it your way though, didn’t I?”\n\n\n As if he doesn’t understand, Uncle Dido squints, deepening his forehead wrinkles. But, after roughly scratching his head, he quickly raises his chin and looks at Lutz. The long held stubbornness has vanished from his gaze.\n\n\n “My way… eh? That means…?”\n\n\n Lutz tilts his head to the side in confusion, and Aunt Karla explains with a sigh.\n\n\n “It means that your father has accepted it in his own way.”\n\n\n “Wai-, mum!? If you knew, why didn’t you tell me!?”\n\n\n “It’s the first time I’ve heard these words as well. There’s no way I could possibly have known before.”\n\n\n Aunt Karla shakes her head and shrugs her shoulders. It seems the lack of communication between child and parent as well as between siblings, also afflicts the married couple. “How am I supposed to know if you don’t tell me…,” Lutz hangs his head crestfallen as if he had lost all strength, and I agree with Lutz’ opinion.\n\n\n Now that I think about it, Lutz would often keep his thoughts to himself at home, it seems it runs in the family.\n\n\n “Dido, does this mean you accept Lutz working as merchant apprentice?”\n\n\n Due to the Head Priest’s question, Uncle Dido nods with an annoyed expression as if telling the Head Priest to not ask him about each and every single thing.\n\n\n “It doesn’t mean I like merchants, and I don’t get why he wants to be one, but if he still wants it despite no matter what we say, it’s fine so long as he goes at it with guts. He can be a live-in apprentice or whatever else. But, taking refuge at the orphanage to escape, there’s no way that I’ll acknowledge that.”\n\n\n With a disapproving air of finality, Uncle Dido straightens again and crosses his arms. I reflexively shout “Uncle, it’s not like that! It’s all because of me! It’s not because of Lutz not having the courage to continue this lifestyle or anything like that!”, but nothing elicits a reaction from anyone in the room.\n\n\n When I glance back at the Head Priest, who should be the only person who can hear me, I see the magic tool dangling uselessly from his wrist. It appears he never had any intention of listening to my voice from the very start. How cruel.\n\n\n “Taking refuge in the orphanage, that was Maine…”\n\n\n Lutz, who had begun the same protest as I did, cuts himself off quickly and snaps his mouth shut. Pursing his lips, he suddenly raises his head defiantly and glares at Uncle.\n\n\n “If that’s the case, why aren’t you giving me permission to go outside the city for work!?”\n\n\n The direct cause for Lutz leaving his home this time was due to him being unable to get permission to go outside the city. For Lutz, who became a merchant apprentice with the goal of leaving the city, that was the most difficult to accept, but even that is cut down with a brief rebuttal.\n\n\n “You’d understand if you bothered to think about it for a second, wouldn’t you?!”\n\n\n Uncle Dido shouts, but Lutz ran away from home because he clearly doesn’t understand. The Head Priest calms them down with a “Now, now” and interrupts the conversation once again.\n\n\n “Tell us the reason since we don’t understand.”\n\n\n “… Again!?”\n\n\n Uncle lets out a weary groan. Frowning and muttering under his breath that he’s bad at this kind of thing, he explains,\n\n\n “Lutz becoming a merchant apprentice and him leaving the city are two totally different things, aren’t they? It’s dangerous outside the city. There’s vicious animals, and also thieves. You don’t take a child out there.”\n\n\n “He’s right! It’s far too dangerous!”\n\n\n I’m taken aback by their words. Since I never left the city except for going to the nearby forest, I never actually experienced it myself, but it seems outside the city is full of dangers.\n\n\n In this place it’s natural for just the children to leave through the gate and go collecting things in the forest. Given that they left in the same manner all over the city, I didn’t think that the outside would be a dangerous place that causes normal parents to object.\n\n\n Besides, at least according to Lutz’ stories, there are troubadours and peddlers in this city, and travellers are freely coming and going at the inns located in the direction of the eastern gate. Therefore, although one might say that it’s difficult to travel, I thought it was just because travelling was inconvenient since travellers use horses and carriages, or walk.\n\n\n On top of that, since Benno, the adult closest to me, has said that he has set up a workshop in a different city and is the very example of someone going outside the city and coming back, I didn’t get the impression that it’s very dangerous.\n\n\n … I guess I still don’t get the common sense around here at all.\n\n\n Although it’s been close to two years now, there are so many things I don’t know. Seeing me sigh beside him, the Head Priest frowns slightly and tilts his head to the side.\n\n\n “It’s not like I’m saying that it’s completely safe, but Benno’s workshop can be reached in a half day with a carriage after leaving the eastern gate. It would be different if it was by foot, but there’s no need to worry if it’s with a carriage, is there?”\n\n\n “It’s unnecessary,” Uncle Dido immediately rebuffs.\n\n\n Lutz’ face flushes, flaring in anger, and he glares at uncle, screaming,\n\n\n “I said that it was for work, didn’t I??!?”\n\n\n “Calm down, Lutz. Dido, what do you mean when you say that it’s unnecessary?”\n\n\n The Head Priest restrains Lutz with a hand and prompts Uncle Dido to explain himself. Even Uncle expected this question from the Head Priest. He turns to look towards Benno and Mark.\n\n\n “Because that man there said he wants to take Lutz out because he built a workshop outside the city.”\n\n\n “What about it?”\n\n\n “Now you listen here, are you telling me that that’s necessary, in any field, for an apprentice? Moreover one who only has a three-year Dalua contract?”\n\n\n If you put it into Japanese terms, a Dalua apprentice is like a contracted apprentice who works for three years. They’re mostly contracted to do simple tasks, while they learn the basics. Even if they are later recruited to a new store or workshop after it is built, they are never involved in the actual construction or contracting of branch stores. Because I knew that it had been Lutz’ dream to go outside the city, I thought that it was great for his dream to come true. However, if you consider it normally, this isn’t the work of a Dalua. It’s the work of Dapla and heirs. It’s not a work Lutz should be doing.\n\n\n Uncle Dido’s belief that there’s no need to make the dangerous trip outside the city for the sake of unnecessary work makes sense.\n\n\n The Head Priest and I together turn our looks at Benno, who sighs lightly and looks at Uncle Dido.\n\n\n ”That’s why I requested the privilege of talking to you the other day. After careful consideration of Lutz’s abilities and the future of the store, I would like to train Lutz as my heir. Involving him in the establishment of the workshop outside the city is a part of this. It’s also why I wish to adopt him”\n\n\n “Humph, that’s out of the question.”\n\n\n Uncle Dido flatly brushes Benno’s request aside. He looks back at the Head Priest and mutters, “Do I have to give a reason for this as well?”\n\n\n The Head Priest answers “Of course,” and Benno, who was turned down, nods while staring at Uncle Dido.\n\n\n “If there’s a reason, I’d like to ask for it by all means. I say this with all due respect, but you, who has likely never traded before, won’t be able to become Lutz’ backer. The adoption should be an agreement that should turn into an advantage, not only for the store, but also for Lutz.”\n\n\n At Benno’s breakdown of the situation, Uncle Dido slightly lowers his eyes for a moment and then looks at Benno firmly in the eyes.\n\n\n “You, you don’t have any children, do you?”\n\n\n “… That’s why I have decided on Lutz as my heir?”\n\n\n “Is the fact that I have no children a reason to turn me down?” Benno frowns doubtfully. From the start, Benno intended to adopt an heir as he has no children.\n\n\n However, Uncle Dido replies with “That’s not what I mean”, before breathing out slowly.\n\n\n “Like you said, I can’t become Lutz’ backer and I’m glad you value Lutz’ abilities.”\n\n\n His gaze wandering as he looks for the right words, Uncle Dido alternated between looking at Benno and Lutz.\n\n\n “You are probably a great storekeeper and a capable merchant. You’re also obviously kind and generous since you put up with all this trouble from Lutz. But you wouldn’t become his parent.”\n\n\n It’s not like he cursed at Benno or gave him an unfair assessment. And yet, he still say that it’s no good. I don’t understand what “But you wouldn’t become his parent.” means.\n\n\n “What do you mean when you say that Benno wouldn’t become his parent? Explain it. Are you saying that there are some unsavory rumors about him?”\n\n\n Uncle Dido groans at the Head Priest’s question. “It would be easier if there were bad rumors about him,” he sighs, and looks directly at Benno.\n\n\n “No matter how great your work reputation might be, you won’t be able to become a parent because the biggest reason to adopt him is to raise the store’s profits. Being a parent isn’t about profit. Or am I wrong?”\n\n\n His eyes widening slightly, obviously taken aback, Benno smiles bitterly.\n\n\n “I see. It’s just as you say. Certainly for me the store’s profit takes the highest priority.”\n\n\n He wanted to adopt Lutz because securing him would be best for Benno and for the store. Of course he likely took Lutz’ character and ability into account, but since he would be an heir for the sake of having him succeed the store, the profit would be the highest priority.\n\n\n It’s a justified approach for a merchant, but it means that Benno can’t say a word in his own defense when he’s accused of not having the attitude of a parent.\n\n\n “I understand the reason why you rejected the adoption now. But, I truly value Lutz’ future prospects highly. Would I be able to get your consent if it wasn’t an adoption but a Dapla contract?”\n\n\n If Dalua are part-timers and contract employees, Dapla are treated like inexperienced management candidates who will be entrusted with the store. The securities, salary and work details will also change completely.\n\n\n “Isn’t that way too fast?”\n\n\n “What do you mean when you call it fast?”\n\n\n At the Head Priest’s interjection, Uncle Dido shrugs his shoulders, not even trying to hide his annoyance.\n\n\n “You usually consider whether to offer a Dapla contract or not after having observed the work of a Dalua contractor for several years. The season hasn’t even changed yet since his baptismal ceremony and the start of his apprenticeship. ”\n\n\n Hearing Uncle Dido’s objection, Benno raises his eyebrows in surprise.\n\n\n “The season hasn’t yet changed since his baptismal ceremony, but Lutz has been working for me for around a year now, though?”\n\n\n “Is that so?”\n\n\n “Indeed. You are probably aware that each added apprentice becomes a burden for a store, right? At first I didn’t plan to take in Lutz, to whom I have neither any relation nor any debt of gratitude. For his trial period, I gave him a task that would be impossible to achieve right away. Yet, Lutz delivered results that went beyond my expectations.”\n\n\n “Hoo…”\n\n\n Uncle Dido listens to Benno as if he’s hearing about this for the first time.\n\n\n If my memory serves, Uncle said that it’s fine for him to become a paper craftsman at that time. I wonder, did he maybe not ask why we were producing paper? Or did Lutz not tell him?\n\n\n “Lutz hasn’t been raised in a merchant family, and yet he puts great efforts toward covering his shortcomings and also possesses fortitude. I want to have him nearby so he can observe before taking him outside. That has to happen as fast as possible if I’m to train him seriously. After all Lutz lacks the basics, even though I value his endeavours.”\n\n\n “Fine.”\n\n\n After saying that, Uncle Dido glances back and sees the Head Priest about to stand up, and adds by himself,\n\n\n “… No matter how much I want to help him, my backing is useless to a merchant. If you think he’ll end up managing the store at some point, that contract will probably help him. ”\n\n\n “Let’s head to the trade guild and finish the formalities at once then.”\n\n\n Marks adds with a smile, causing Uncle Dido to grimace while looking very reluctant.\n\n\n “This is the reason why merchants…”\n\n\n “… Dad.”\n\n\n The word gently escapes Lutz’ mouth.\n\n\n Well aware of the meaning behind his father’s cut-off words, Lutz is probably overcome with emotion after experiencing the full force of the love directed at him. His tears glisten as they drop from those jade eyes that resemble Uncle Dido’s so much. Aunt Karla sobs quietly as well, but Uncle Dido, caught in-between them, averts his eyes from both of them uncomfortably and scratches his head. As he was not one to willingly discuss these things, he seemed to be embarrassed and emotional.\n\n\n “Lutz! Apologize!”\n\n\n Uncle Dido suddenly yells, his face red, though it’s hard to tell if it’s due to emotion or because he’s heavily sunburned.\n\n\n “… Dido, he won’t understand with just that.”\n\n\n The Head Priest points out with a sigh. Uncle looks at a loss for words for a moment, before quickly shouting\n\n\n “You got this many people involved because of your reckless behaviour and selfish misunderstanding. Apologize with all your heart!”\n\n\n Uncle Dido’s words pierce my heart. The one who got this many people involved is not Lutz, but rather me.\n\n\n “I-I’m sorry!”\n\n\n My voice still doesn’t reach anyone, but I apologize together with Lutz. Lutz’ parents watch Lutz, but the Head Priest’s, Benno’s and Mark’s gazes are turned my way.\n\n\n “Hey, we are going back, stupid son!”\n\n\n Once Lutz rushes over, Uncle Dido’s fist lands on Lutz’ head with a thump. Even while wiping away his tears and saying “Ouch” after being hit, Lutz looks happy as he stands next to Uncle.\n\n\n “My words were apparently lacking as well. … Umm, you were a big help.”\n\n\n After Uncle Dido says that to the Head Priest with an awkward expression, he turns around and leaves the room. Aunt Karla takes Lutz’ hand and walks out with him.\n\n\n ◆◇◆◇◆\n\n\n Master, we should also go to the trade guild.”\n\n\n “Head Priest, I’m truly thankful for today. We were able to find a satisfactory conclusion thanks to your timely assistance.”\n\n\n After an unnecessarily long speech, Benno finally excuses himself. He’s probably chasing after Lutz and his parents to finalise the Dapla contract at the trade guild.\n\n\n Once Benno and Mark leave the room, only the Head Priest and I are left in the room. Grey-robed priests start to come and go in order to put away the chairs and such.\n\n\n “Make sure to always get a full account on all viewpoints. Listening to only one side will distort your way of understanding.”\n\n\n “Yes.”\n\n\n Seeing me nod and soundlessly reply, the Head Priest grasps the magic tool still hanging from his wrist.\n\n\n “It’s a good thing for that family to not break apart, right?”\n\n\n “Eh?”\n\n\n When I blink up at him after hearing that sudden remark, the Head Priest elaborates, “You said it yourself, didn’t you?” Still appearing fairly stoic, he frowns as if he’s slightly displeased.\n\n\n “Having Lutz reconcile with his family so that he goes back home was the best possible outcome for you, right?”\n\n\n Due to the Head Priest’s words, I recall Lutz’ delighted, tear-stained face. That image of a Lutz crying tears of joy as he goes home with Uncle and Aunty after the all the misunderstandings he’s endured this whole time, makes my eyes burn with tears as well.\n\n\n “Yeah, it’s wonderful… really wonderful…”\n\n\n It’s not like there wasn’t any affection between parent and child, but things just kept snowballing due to the lack of communication. It’s great that Lutz was able to return to his family.\n\n\n “Stop crying. … Doesn’t this look as if I made you cry?”\n\n\n He glances at the grey-robed priests, who are silently watching the situation as they wait, and reveals a bitter expression.\n\n\n “These are tears of happiness, so it’s fine.”\n\n\n “Good grief, you are…”\n\n\n Seeing me try to wipe my tears with the sleeve of my blue robe, the Head Priest lends me a handkerchief with a very uncomfortable expression.\n\n\n From the name embroidered on the handkerchief, I learned that the Head Priest’s name is Ferdinand."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Well, the problem that Lutz had few conversations with his families was somehow settled. Besides, while the gap between the brothers still exists, Lutz became a Dapla [namely one who signs a contract with a shop and is cultivated as a manager of the shop] and the income is raised. This seems to make the situation more complicated.\n\n\n However, Lutz has been reconciled with his parents, and his parents come to understand the necessity of discussion, so it will be somehow manageable in their future life. I am happy to see Lutz's living environment improved.\n\n\n After settling the problem of Lutz, I'm worried about my mother's health. She turns pale these days, so I suspect that she has been affected by my bad condition. Mother still goes to work and does housework normally, but she sleeps more than before.\n\n\n This morning, mother looks so pale and totters wearily. Father is not home. Possibly he went to work before I get up. I donít know what to do if my mother fells down suddenly.\n\n\n \"Mom, how do you feel? Are you okay?\" seeing her not eating right now, I ask.\n\n\n She thinks for a while, and then say, \"I said Iím ok, right?\"\n\n\n \" Mom, are you having a baby? I will become an elder sister, right?\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Huh!?\"\n\n\n Her pregnancy is proved. I am surprised, and look at her belly, though it is as flat as usual.\n\n\n … Mother is suffering morning sickness.\n\n\n When I was still Urano Motosu, I didnít have any love experience, let alone such things as pregnancy experience. I donít have any related memory, so this is my first time to see an expectant mother.\n\n\n No! I didn't read any book related to pregnancy as it is completely unrelated to me. Ha ha! For now, at the time of suffering morning sickness, she should have a good rest, proper nourishment, moderate exercise? What should I do?\n\n\n I was the only child when I was Urano Motosu. I have never been an elder sister. Although I wished to be a wonderful elder sister, could I be able to do it, to be an elder sister, like Tuuli?\n\n\n While I am in a daze with expectations and anxieties, Tuuli cheers full of joy.\n\n\n \"Really?! Oh! I will make clothes and diapers for the baby!\"\n\n\n Tuuliís prompt action to collect the stuff for the baby makes me hurry to consider what I could do for the baby.\n\n\n \"Well, I … uh, uh …\"\n\n\n What can I give when the baby is born? The first thing comes to my mind is the one that does not exist in this house. Itís the one that I've been seeking for since I came here.\n\n\n \"I'll make a picture book for the baby!\"\n\n\n \"… A picture book? What is it?\"\n\n\n Both Tuuli and my mother ask.\n\n\n \"A book with pictures! I will make a book for children to read!\"\n\n\n Hearing my explanation, Tuuli, with her eyes wide open, bursts into laugher.\n\n\n \"Hahahaha, itís just like what you will do.\"\n\n\n \"Since you do so much for the baby, itís enough to prove that you will be a good sister, too.\"\n\n\n Though I don't know whether it's a brother or sister, it must be very cute. If Tuuli makes clothes with sewing skills that she learned at work, I'm going to make educational toys for my younger brother or sister.\n\n\n \"… I will do my best for the baby. I will be a really good sister!\"\n\n\n Hearing my decision, they stop laughing and turn into troubled faces, disapprovingly.\n\n\n \"Maine, you would have a fever if you worked too hard, so please relax.\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. I am out of condition, so you have to take care of yourself,\" mom said to me.\n\n\n \"… Well, I will try.\"\n\n\n Although I make a thankful reply, all in my mind is how to make the picture book.\n\n\n What kind of books will a baby like? In my previous life, I often read the picture books listed in the bulletins of my city. Of course, those books are best-sellers. There are pages to show or hide faces alternately, by which children can play peekaboo games.\n\n\n …… But how to explain peekaboo in this world?\n\n\n The way to soothe a baby by hiding and showing the face in the world, so I think here is the same. However, I donít know what people in this world say to babies when they perform this. Then, how to ask this question is a problem.\n\n\n … An idea comes to me: make one of motherís bedtime stories into a picture book.\n\n\n \"Good morning, Lutz. Today I will go to the temple after visiting the store,\" I said to Lutz with a stuffy nose.\n\n\n When Lutz saw me humming to greet him, he takes one step back as if he saw something eerie.\n\n\n \"Good, but how are you doing? You are in bad condition, but in high spirits.\"\n\n\n \"Ufu … Yeah, see, I'm going to be a sister,\" I sneezed\n\n\n \"Maine, get your luggage fast.\"\n\n\n Kneading her temples, mother hurries me, when I am walking to the bedroom. Then she begins to tell Lutz why she is in this state.\n\n\n \"Lutz, excuse me. She must be too glad that she is going to be an elder sister. This girl, I'm afraid she is a bit overexcited. Maybe itís better for her not to go out today …\"\n\n\n \"Not only today? I think she will keep excited until the day when Aunt Elfa gives birth. ? Maine resembles Uncle Gunther very much, doesnít she?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, in merriment, they do have a strong resemblance.\"\n\n\n Though she frowns, mother still laughs happily.\n\n\n \"Just a minute, Lutz. Well, mom, I'm going. I know I should behave myself, even when Iím unhappy, just like what mom has done. I will work hard to make money for you from now on. Bye!\"\n\n\n \"Maine, it's what your dad said this morning.\"\n\n\n While mother is laughing, I set off. First, I will go to the Gilberta Company, to tell them Iíll become an elder sister, and then order some cardboard for the orphanage.\n\n\n On my way, Iím talking with Lutz about the picture book plan.\n\n\n \"Well, because Tuuli said she would sew clothes and diapers for the baby, I decided to make a \"picture book'.\"\n\n\n \"What's that?\"\n\n\n \"Itís a book with pictures, easy for children to read,\" I explain proudly.\n\n\n Lutz shakes his head lightly and says with a sigh, \"… Yeah, but how can a new-born baby read? \"\n\n\n \"Reading is very important! I read a lot. If you want to make a picture book, you need thick paper first, right? Because babies can chew anything they have. How about the thinner cardboard, or a cloth? But I havenít seen any proper materials here, so maybe I donít have a chance to make a picture book, do I? Lutz, what should I do? \"\n\n\n I turn around at Lutz, but he looks bewildered.\n\n\n \"What to do … uh …\"\n\n\n \"Don't you feel really sad if you have no chance to do what you want? Look, itís easy for a baby to tear and chew a picture book made of paper. And what will happen if it chews the paper with ink? Oh no! Thatís too dangerous!\"\n\n\n The image comes into my mind: a baby is biting a book, and the ink smears his mouth. When I am holding my head, Lutz shakes my shoulders, and sighs,\n\n\n \"Maine, take it easy. The baby will be born in next spring, right? You neednít be so hurry.\"\n\n\n \"But I want to make a prototype, then improve and improve, and make it perfect!\"\n\n\n \"Haste does not bring success. You may be exhausted before you finish it. So calm down and think about othersí opinions, ok?\"\n\n\n While Lutz is exhorting me, we arrive at a Bennoís shop. Mark is working hard there as usual.\n\n\n \"Hi, Mark, where is Mr. Benno? I want to re-order the cardboard from that Zeek's woodwork workshop.\"\n\n\n \"Ok, we accept it here. You look so good, Maine,\" Mark says, taking out the order notes.\n\n\n I can feel that Iím in high spirit as soon as I hear his words.\n\n\n \"Sneeze… Mark, please listen. I'm going to be an elder sister. So I'm will make books, cards, blocks, etc. for the baby. I'll be very busy from this day forward.\"\n\n\n \"Ho, a book for the baby? So, you are going to tell master that you will be an elder sister soon, right?\"\n\n\n Mark smiles and shows me to the back room while saying so. I rush to Mr. Benno and tell him.\n\n\n \"Mr. Benno, good morning. I will be an elder sister in spring. So I decide to make a picture book.\"\n\n\n \"Ah? … Lutz, can you explain the situation?\"\n\n\n Benno, who lifts his eyes, says not to me, but to Lutz.\n\n\n \"Maine's mother is pregnant and the baby will be born in spring. Maine wants to do something unique for the baby. She is working hard to make a book with lots of pictures.\"\n\n\n \"A book for children? Babies can't read, can they?\"\n\n\n Benno and Lutz ask the same question. A picture book can perfect link parents and children. Children can enjoy it just by looking at the picture. Besides, though it is possible for children to get familiar with the letters, no one here knows this.\n\n\n \"Reading is very important! And children can become familiar with letters since they are babies.\"\n\n\n \"Oh … maybe Corinna will also celebrate it. Who paints the picture?\"\n\n\n \"Of course, Iíll draw the pictures with love.\"\n\n\n It is my first chance to make a present for my younger brother or sister. So I decide to make it by myself. As I just finish my words, Mr. Benno denies:\n\n\n \"No, you can ask the artist for help. Children's aesthetic sense is different.\"\n\n\n \"Itís an awful idea!\"\n\n\n \"It's not awful. It's a good suggestion.\"\n\n\n Mr. Benno insists that I should invite Wilma as the painter, as if my sisterís love is denied. I go to the temple sullenly.\n\n\n \"Well, Maine. If you're going to make a picture book from now on, it's better to have the painter. You havenít finish one book, have you?\"\n\n\n \"No, not yet.\"\n\n\n However, if I go to ask Wilma to help me make a picture book, it may be better to assist her from my side.\n\n\n \"Good morning, Miss Maine. How are things with you?\"\n\n\n \"Good morning, Fran. I'm going to be an elder sister…\"\n\n\n \"Wait a minute, Maine. I tell you first.\"\n\n\n Lutz interrupts me, and tells Fran that I can fall anytime since I get overexcited now, along with the cause of excitement.\n\n\n \"If she gets too excited, she may have a fever. Once this happens, she could not calm down. So then you should keep her alone carefully.\"\n\n\n \"… I see. \"\n\n\n While I am heading to my room, Fran warns me, \"Itís better not to tell Delia.\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Recently, the chief of the temple has not taken any action, but surely he is collecting information. If you can be so easily excited, pregnant women and babies may be considered major weaknesses. Please be careful.\""

    "content": " \n\n\n\n My face turns pale. If something happens to my mother and the baby, I don't think I could control myself.\n\n\n \"I think it good to make a new product in Maine's Workshop. Though it seems not to be a problem, please do not mention the brother or sister relationships. Topics like giving birth are not so welcome here.\"\n\n\n Pursing my lips, I imagine the flower offering (girls to be offered as mistresses to the nobles) and the future of gray-robed priestesses who would have a baby. My buoyant mood is destroyed, since this makes me calm down a little.\n\n\n Maybe Fran is trying to cheer me up, he changes the topic.\n\n\n \"Will there be plenty of pictures in the new book Miss Maine wants to make? So, have you decided to ask Wilma for help finally?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, that's right. So I want to ask the Head Priest whether I could take Wilma as assistant…\"\n\n\n After hearing my words, Fran frowns for a while, and then he says, \"That's right. It would be better to ask the Head Priest first for permission.\"\n\n\n Because I wrote a letter to the Head Priest for permission, I request Fran to help me arrange a proper time to meet Head Priest.\n\n\n After the Head Priest comes into his office, he glances at the letter, and then looks at me, asking, \"What do you need? If you can tell me briefly, I'll listen now.\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I want need Wilma's help!\"\n\n\n I try my best to make my request brief, but the Head Priest rubs his temples.\n\n\n \"… What do you mean? I can't follow you at all. Please give me your explanation.\"\n\n\n \"I need Wilma's help. The gentle and lovely Wilma. She is good at drawing, and is kind to children.\"\n\n\n I do my best to describe Wilma, but it seems that the Head Priest still cannot understand me. His confused eyes turn to Fran.\n\n\n \"Fran.\"\n\n\n \"…She wants to take Wilma as assistant.\"\n\n\n Fran understands what the Head Priest means when his named is called. So he explains promptly.\n\n\n \"Wilma used to be an attendant of Miss Christine. She is a gray-robed priestess who is good at painting.\n\n\n \"Oh, she wants a priestess apprentice who likes art… So, isn't a music-related apprentice better for her artistic cultivation? We have a virtuoso of harp, right?\"\n\n\n \"Do you refer to Rosina?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, you can take her as your assistant.\"\n\n\n When I am quietly listening to their conversation, the topic is changing from Wilma to Rosina. I immediately stand between Fran and the Head Priest.\n\n\n \"Sir, for me, Wilma is more important, compared with Rosina.\"\n\n\n \"What you need now is artistic achievement, right?\"\n\n\n \"I need a painter. I can't make a picture book by music.\"\n\n\n \"What's a picture book?\"\n\n\n It's the umpteenth time I have been asked about this question. \"It's a book for children, with a lot of pictures,\" I make the same reply. Books are written for the nobles in this world. Is there any book for children, like picture books?\n\n\n But the Head Priest frowns and looks at me.\n\n\n \"…What's the book for children? It's weird.\"\n\n\n \"Even in the noble families, there wouldn't be such a thing, right?\"\n\n\n \"Book itself is expensive, so it's weird to make such a book for children who don't even know how to handle a book, right? If it's a book for study, I think the one with systematic knowledge is better. What do you think?\"\n\n\n Apparently, there is no such book for children in this world. Paper is expensive. If you want to write a book, it may be full of letters. There may be some necessary diagrams or graphs for study purpose, but I don't think there is any book full of illustrations.\n\n\n Though I know the reason why there is no picture book for children only in my way, the Head Priest seems to be able to understand it somehow.\n\n\n \"Well, ok. I see. You want to make a picture book, so you need to ask a painter for help. But what you need is artistic cultivation.\n\n\n So, please take Rosina as assistant also, not only Wilma.\n\n\n \"… I don't want unnecessary things.\"\n\n\n \"Unnecessary?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest squints his eyes, gazing at me. But I don't need two assistants.\n\n\n \"Even if Rosina becomes my assistant, I don't have any musical instrument. Is there any fest for which players have to buy expensive musical instruments? I've been disdained as a commoner. Is there any chance for me to play musical instruments for those nobles?\"\n\n\n I'm not very interested in music. Though I also like listening to the music, I haven't thought about playing an instrument. I know giving an instrumental performance is very cool, but I really prefer to read in the time needed for practice.\n\n\n The musical instruments are too expensive, and I have no intention to practice. To tell the truth, both money and time it needs are a waste for me.\n\n\n \"I haven't prepared any money for the expensive musical instruments, so I don't think it necessary for me to learn music.\"\n\n\n \"I see. It's true. If you have no musical instrument, you cannot practice.\"\n\n\n In the meantime, the Head Priest nods as if he has understood. Now that the Head Priest has agreed that I take Wilma as my assistant, I am satisfied and leave his office.\n\n\n \"Then, Fran. Let's go to the orphanage this afternoon to make sure whether Wilma agrees or not.\"\n\n\n \"Agree or not? She will go to serve you, won't she?\"\n\n\n Hearing my words, Fran blinks at me in confusion.\n\n\n \"… I'm a commoner. Maybe Wilma does not want to be my assistant.\n\n\n Originally, Fran and Delia were ordered to be my attendants, though neither of the two was the attendant I wished. Not long before, I heard the complaints about serving a commoner.\n\n\n Though I tried my best this time, if people are discontented with their jobs, they will bring negative effects on others. If Wilma does not want to work as my assistant, then I won't force her. Thus there would be no problem to ask her for helping me make picture books. Even though, I am still worried whether Wilma would serve others.\n\n\n In the afternoon, I go to the orphanage to visit Wilma. Because Fran is with me, we can only enter the dining hall, we talk there.\n\n\n Wilma's beautiful brown eyes always narrow. She talked with me few days ago about the orphans and the things insufficient in the orphanage. When Wilma sees Fran and me, she looks a little bit worried.\n\n\n \"Miss Maine, what do we talk about?\"\n\n\n \"Wilma, would you like to be my assistant? This is not an order. I just want to confirm that. So it doesn't matter if you refuse me.\n\n\n Hearing my words, Wilma looks around, and after a light sigh, she casts her eyes down.\n\n\n \"… I really appreciate it, but please allow me to say no. Instead of me, please choose Rosina.\"\n\n\n \"Still because I am a commoner?\"\n\n\n \"No! It's not like that.\"\n\n\n Wilma shakes her head furiously. And after catching a glimpse of Fran, she averts her gaze from him embarrassedly. She frowns, as if it is very difficult to explain, then she says, \"… I used to be cheated by a blue-robed priest, and followed him to go out for flower offering. My master Christine noticed my absence, she helped to me back on safe ground. But from that day on, it becomes difficult for me to communicate with gentlemen. So if I work at your house where gentlemen come in and out…\"\n\n\n The rooms of blue-robed priestess in noble areas, different from the orphanage director's office, are completely separated from rooms of gray-robed priests. So Wilma herself need not communicate with those priests, and can live a tranquil life.\n\n\n But in my house, rooms on the first floor and the second floor are prepared for males and females separately.\n\n\n However, people have to pass the first floor when they go out. Besides, if they want to see the cooks, they can also see the guests, like Benno. A grey-robed priest like Fran can go upstairs as freely as he can.\n\n\n \"If this is an order, I will obey it. But if you ask my opinion, I will say I want to live in this females' house of the orphanage, as always. Because only children and females live here.\"\n\n\n It seems that she does not want to change the current condition. I know Wilma's opinion, but there are things I cannot understand.\n\n\n \"You live in the orphanage, so you will become the target of flower offering, right?\"\n\n\n \"No blue-robed priest will pay attention to unimpressive girls like me.\"\n\n\n With the neat and plain hair style, maybe she is doing her best not to cause more attention. However, her distinct golden hair was eye-catching, and her relaxed smile and beauty fail to be hidden in her plain clothes. Wilma is just like a saintess, taking care of children. I don't think staying here will be the reason that any blue-robed priest does not notice her.\n\n\n \"In my eyes, Wilma who loves the children is very attractive.\"\n\n\n \"That's because you are a girl, and still young.\"\n\n\n While I am approaching Wilma who smiles in a shy way for my praise, I feel myself like an amorous blue-robed priest who is going to lead her away.\n\n\n \"Well, Wilma. If I ask the Head Priest to let you live here when you work as my assistant only, will you be my assistant?\"\n\n\n \"… I could not ask for more. Why do you do so much for me?\"\n\n\n Wilma looks at me unbelievably, tilting her head to the side.\n\n\n \"Because from this day on, I want to make books with lots of pictures for children. You are good at painting. I really need your help. \"\n\n\n \"So, it'll be easy if you give me an order …\"\n\n\n \"I don't hope you work unwillingly.\"\n\n\n I myself do not like someone to order me. If an attendant lived in her master's house, all the affairs would become her work. Then there must be something unhappy, and problems will occur.\n\n\n \"Thank you very much, Miss Maine. If I needn't leave the orphanage, I will work merrily to assist you,\" she says, giggling.\n\n\n In order to protect this delighted face, I will do anything to persuade the Head Priest."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"Miss Maine, the attendants should move to their Masters' house. They can't live in the orphanage. How do you persuade the Head Priest?\"\n\n\n As soon as we leave the orphanage, Fran asks sincerely.\n\n\n \"Now, there is no gray-robed priestess in the orphanage to take care of the children. So as the orphanage director, I will suggest that my attendant stay there and take care of them. There used to be children who suddenly have a fever in the midnight.\"\n\n\n \"… I didn't think about this at all. Thus I feel a little relieved,\" says Fran.\n\n\n I'm surprised at Fran's way of speaking to me. Noticing that I get sulky about his less politeness, Fran added in panic,\n\n\n \"Miss Maine, you often swing into action as soon as you come up with an idea, so I'm worried how you should explain to the Head Priest…\"\n\n\n \"I take Wilma as an attendant, and have her live in the orphanage. Do you approve of my idea or not, Fran? You still oppose this plan, right?\"\n\n\n \"This will break the tradition, but I think it would be better if we consider it from orphans' or Wilma's point of view.\"\n\n\n With Fran's support, I write to the Head Priest to ask for a meeting. The Head Priest writes back, and says that he has consulted with Fran about Wilma's affair, and it would be better to talk in my room than in the hidden room. The meeting is arranged at 5 o'clock 5 days later.\n\n\n I have been working energetically until the meeting day.\n\n\n I ask Gil to get some thick sheets of paper for Maine's Workshop for making picture books, and I promise to buy it through Lutz.\n\n\n On the other hand, I read mother's bedtime tales at the orphanage and observe children's response, in order to find out whether they are able to understand the tales or not. However, after hearing the tales, the children do not enjoy them and ask a number of questions, like \"What's that?\" Wilma does not know the life in my city, so she says she is not able to represent it in the painting. The difference between common sense and life seems to be bigger than I thought.\n\n\n Furthermore, people in the temple seem to have no concept of personalized animals. Even when I tell them about the Seven Kids and Momotaro tales, they ask, \"How can animals talk?\" Thus, it is difficult to make the storybook that I heard before to be a picture book.\n\n\n It seems better to have Wilma draw the Scripture-related pictures.\n\n\n … After all, it is the first picture book for my first brother or sister, maybe I should draw some pictures, too.\n\n\n At that time, Hugo and Ella, who have learnt a lot of new recipes, hire a new cook, a man of the same age as Fugo. The guy is often excited by the new dish when learning, and makes incomprehensible noises such as \"Huh?\" and \"Wow!?\", as if he is flustered.\n\n\n Ella, an assistant, says, \"It's Okay. You will get used to it after a few days,\" seeming to be thinking over own experience before.\n\n\n Soon, the meeting day comes. The appointment is in the afternoon, so I cannot go to the library. Instead, I stay at home. Fran and I are practicing how to greet the Head Priest and make his favorite tea.\n\n\n Then the bell rings, much earlier than the appointed time. That's the bell held by the attendants. They ring it to tell people in the room that someone comes.\n\n\n \"It's the Head Priest's assistants.\"\n\n\n \"How do you know it?\"\n\n\n \"The bell sounds different.\"\n\n\n As Fran is speaking, he gets down to the ground floor. Because the Head Priest is busy with too many affairs, maybe he wants to change the visit time.\n\n\n As I lean out from upstairs, looking down, I saw Delia coming out of the kitchen and walking fast towards the door. The reception of visitors is the apprentice's job.\n\n\n After Delia confirms the visitors and their purpose, she opens the door. The gray-robed priests carrying big boxes come in one after another.\n\n\n \"These are gifts from the Head Priest. Where shall we put them?\"\n\n\n \"To the second floor. Please put them into the master's room.\"\n\n\n While Delia is speaking, Fran leads the way and they carry the packages to the second floor. I hurry back to the desk and put on a pretty smile as a lady.\n\n\n \"Excuse me, Miss Maine.\"\n\n\n Arnaud comes to greet me. Under the direction of Delia and Fran, the grey-robed priests leave the luggages in my room. Arnaud narrows his eyes, and looks around the room nostalgically.\n\n\n \"… Miss Maine has kept everything at the same state.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?\"\n\n\n \"No, never mind. … 3 big boxes, 2 small boxes. Ok, confirmed. See you, then.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you. Please say thanks to the Head Priest for me.\"\n\n\n I smile at Arnaud. Arnaud leads the Head Priest's assistants back in a row.\n\n\n As soon as Fran says good-bye and closes the door, he quickly comes up to the second floor.\n\n\n \"Let's open it now. The Head Priest will come soon. Delia, please go to the workshop and call Gil.\"\n\n\n \"Ok! Well, gifts shouldn't be sent just before a personal visit.\"\n\n\n As Delia rushes out, Fran hurries to open the cases. Soon, Delia and Gil come back and join in.\n\n\n In the wooden case wrapped a suite of bedclothes, and two musical instruments - one for adults, the other for children. Besides, there are several tools for maintenance of musical instruments. It seems that the Head Priest will, at all costs, help me to improve artistic cultivation.\n\n\n … Wow. I refused his advice by the reason of no musical instrument, and then the instruments are sent here.\n\n\n \"Yeah, Fran. Did the Head Priest say anything to you?\"\n\n\n Indeed, rather than gratitude, I feel more puzzled about so many gifts. In particular, I have never received bedclothes, so I'm pretty confused. Fran seems to be so confused as well, that he frowns.\n\n\n \"When you fainted in the introspection room, the Head Priest was very angry, because you are so weak that you often fall down in a faint but have not gotten your bed prepared. Though the Head Priest does not live here, he knows all about this. Maybe he presents you with the bedclothes for this…\"\n\n\n I did faint in the temple several times, so I also think I need to prepare the bedclothes, but I didn't expect I will receive the bedclothes from the Head Priest.\n\n\n \"But it's a really good, isn't it?\"\n\n\n After Gil and Delia make the bed, I approach it and touch it with my hands.\n\n\n The futon selected by the Head Priest is different from mine, which is filled with straw. This is a superior product, like the one prepared in the guest room of Frieda's house. It's luxurious, with a lot of embroidery in its pleasant texture.\n\n\n Even the cloth and embroidery cost a large sum of money. However, it seems stupid to think about its price when a suit of bedclothes is presented as a gift.\n\n\n I don't know if it's normal for the nobles to present such gifts. Maybe the Head Priest just lends it to me, and will charge me for it later.\n\n\n \"Fran, maybe it's better to pay for that later, right?\"\n\n\n \"No, maybe it's an apology for putting you in the introspection room where you fell down in a faint. So it's better to keep it.\"\n\n\n \"Apology… Which God should I thank this time?\"\n\n\n I ask Fran wearily whether I have to learn a new God's name again for the gifts. He covers his mouth with his hands, looks as if enduring a frantic laugh.\n\n\n \"Just thank the Head Priest instead of God this time.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes. It's the Head Priest who gives me the gifts.\""

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Before the bell rings 5 times, I put the bedclothes on my bed, and looks for a place to store the musical instruments and tools for maintenance of musical instruments. After I managed to tidy up my room, I give the wooden cases and cloth to the attendants.\n\n\n As soon as the bell rings the fifth time, the Head Priest comes and Arnaud follows him. I meet and greet the Head Priest as Fran taught me. \"Though it feels not quite sure, you've remembered it anyway,\" the Head Priest makes comments on my behavior.\n\n\n \"Sir, thank you very much for the comfortable futon.\"\n\n\n \"You, just…\"\n\n\n Then we go upstairs. I show the bed and thank the Head Priest, but he holds his head.\n\n\n \"Is there anything wrong? I just said thank you, right?\"\n\n\n \"… Yes. You just said thanks. But you didn't have to say anything about the exact gift. From now on, when you say thank you, you should only use the vague expression like ‘nice gift’ or ‘my long-wished-for gift’.\"\n\n\n \"Ok.\"\n\n\n I repeat in the heart that the contents of the gift should not be spoken. The Head Priest put on a weird look as if he is chewing a bitter insect, and lowers his voice,\n\n\n \"Besides, don't tell others that I present you with bedclothes as a gift.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?\"\n\n\n \"Usually, bedclothes are prepared for a mistress of a family or for … a fiancee. It can cause misunderstanding.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?! \"Why, why did you do the thing that might be misunderstood?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest is not as careless as me. He knows it misleading, but still presented bedclothes to me. I don't know the reason.\n\n\n The Head Priest answers my questions with sharp eyes.\n\n\n \"It's your fault this time.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"You are weak and have fallen down in a faint in the temple several times, but you still leave your bed unmade,\" says he. \"That day, when you fainted and Fran carried you, I could not believe my eyes when I saw the bed.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest doubts when I will have my bedclothes prepared if he does nothing at all. I do have a memory like a sieve. So he ordered the futon. I haven't thought about this in my mind, and I turn my eyes softly.\n\n\n \"… Well, I am very sorry.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest coughs deliberately, and glances at the table. Remembering that I have not offered the seat, I invite the Head Priest to sit down.\n\n\n \"D-ampleur is Head Priest's favorite. Do you like today's tea?\"\n\n\n \"Well, it has been long time since I had the tea made by Fran last time.\"\n\n\n Today’s guest is the Head Priest, so I ask Fran to make the tea, instead of Delia. There is not one drop wasted. Delia watches Fran serving the tea in a skilled way. Although the same water and tea leaves are used, Fran's tea tastes totally different.\n\n\n \"Hm, it still smells good.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest narrows his eyes, intoxicated. Seeing his expression of enjoying the tea, Fran seems to be a little relieved.\n\n\n Delia takes the plates from Gil and places them on the table.\n\n\n \"Please have some sweets. It's cookies. The sweetness is modest for the gentlemen who do not like sugar so much.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest takes a mouthful of crisp cookie, widening his eyes slightly. After the Head Priest tastes one of the cookies, he takes another. According to his response, I don't think it tastes too bad.\n\n\n \"… Maine, where do you get this?\n\n\n \"I just made it in my kitchen,\" I answer. \"Could I have your comments? I'm going to sell it.\n\n\n It will be prepared for Italian restaurant as tea cake after meal, or sold in small package as a souvenir.\"\n\n\n \"… You not only make paper and essence in person, but also food, right?\" says the Head Priest.\n\n\n \"Eh, I'm going to have a tasting party before the store opens,\" I reply. \"So if your schedule permit, please come, too. I'm going to run a restaurant to serve food which the nobles often eat. Fran can guarantee the taste, but I wish to experience a real noble meal.\"\n\n\n I gave him a hint gain and again with an expectant look. The Head Priest is good at reading the expression, and drops his eyes as if he gives in upon my tenacity.\n\n\n \"… I see. I will invite you for lunch soon.\"\n\n\n \"Ok! I'm honored.\"\n\n\n Now that one of Benno's tasks has been fulfilled, I would like to confirm the materials, the taste and the service of the Head Priest's lunch.\n\n\n After tasting the tea and cookies, the Head Priest cuts to the chase.\n\n\n \"So, do you mean that you've had a talk with Wilma?\"\n\n\n \"I want Wilma to live in the orphanage after becoming my attendant. May I ask for your permission?\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest frowns in confusion. The attendants as the name implies, shall serve the master by their master's side. There are some people who wish to leave the orphanage, but none wishes to stay.\n\n\n \"Wilma herself wants to stay,\" I explain. \"Because she thinks that children of the orphanage need someone to take care of. Usually, the little children who have not received the Baptism should be looked after by the grey-robed priestesses who have ever been delivered of a baby. But there is none of them at present, right? So, by my authority as the orphanage director, I want to make Wilma stay in the orphanage to take care of the children.\"\n\n\n \"Sir, I also beg a favor of you,\" Fran adds. \"There is no one to take care of the children now. They may get sick and sometimes have a fever during the night. Wilma is very worried about the children.\"\n\n\n \"Hmm,\" on Fran's words, the Head Priest strokes his chin.\n\n\n \"Anyway, it is a plausible excuse…, but if Wilma still lives in the orphanage, please take Rosina as your attendant as well. I've prepared the musical instruments for you. Thus, there would be no problem, right?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest looks at me with his sharp eyes.\n\n\n \"Sir, why do you insist that I should get artistic cultivation? As I said before, I don't have any chance to perform at temple ceremonies, right?\" I ask.\n\n\n \"There is no need to perform in the temple at all. There will be blue-robed priests who have no hobby in music,\" the Head Priest explains.\n\n\n \"Then why?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest takes out a small magic tool. It's a magic tool to prevent eavesdropping. I know it by sight. We hold it in our hands together.\n\n\n \"You will definitely be involved with nobles in the future.\"\n\n\n \"… But I am not going to leave my families.\"\n\n\n Because of this, I join the temple but still live at home. The Head Priest knows I possess great mana, so he is supposed to understand my relationship with the families to some extent. He says, \"It is not open to doubt\", so anxiety creeps up on me.\n\n\n \"Maybe you don't know, if mana is not balanced, people can't have babies,\" he continues. \"You are alright even after you offer 10 small magic stones, and your mana is great enough to get in my secret. That is to say, you can have children with no one other than a noble. So I don't think you will get married in the Civilian Area.\"\n\n\n Speaking of this, I recalled that Delia did talk about magical balance before. Only the couple with equal mana can have babies. I was angry at the blue-robed priest's inhumanity, so I was not aware of at all that the law surely applies to me.\n\n\n However, I don't think it will bring any effect on me."

So, there will be no problem, right?\"\n\n\n \"Wait, Why?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest widens his eyes with surprise. But I confess that I have given up marriage and giving birth from the very beginning.\n\n\n When I was Urano Motosu, this was still a question in the far future for me, so I was not so pessimistic. If I devote myself to making books, time is very precious and life would seem quite short.\n\n\n \"As you know, my body is weak. No one wants to marry a woman who cannot work steadily and often have a fever. I will be a burden to my partner, won't I?\" I explain.\n\n\n In the slum area, the first requirement for a good daughter-in-law is she shall be healthy and strong. And she should always be good-tempered and diligent.

The situation of the nobles is different,\" says the Head Priest.\n\n\n \"Huh?\"\n\n\n \"Children's mana is strongly affected by their mother. Your mana is so strong that it is beyond imagination. The number of the nobles is less than before. When you are old enough, many nobles will want to marry you in order to balance their mana. It will cost a lot if they adopt you now and raise you. Because you are so weak and they don't know when you will die, they leave you alone in the temple. It is impossible for you to get rid of the families of all the blue-robed priests.\"\n\n\n That is to say, now I am like a livestock waiting to be fertilized. I am observed by everyone, while I know nothing about it at all. This upsets me. There are tens of blue-robed priests. If their parents' houses will send people to catch me, how many nobles will come for me?\n\n\n \"The nobles of lower class are not able to balance their mana by you, so they might use you as a tool to get related with the nobles of higher class,\" he continues. \"Then, you will be treated as a tool for giving birth. As a blue-robed priestess, you can also train yourself to behave like the nobles to get and guarantee the higher class position. As a result, your life will be changed a lot. So, get your artistic cultivation for your self-defense.\"\n\n\n My body shivers. I have never thought about such a future.\n\n\n Once, Mr. Benno said to me that I would be driven out of the temple as the number of nobles would grow again in about five years. I think I can leave the temple at that time. I don't want to leave my families. If there is no noble who wants to marry me, I am going to escape and prolong lifespan by using the tau fruit.\n\n\n I have not expected that I will be chosen by the nobles as an ideal mother.\n\n\n \"… I see. I will also take Rosina, and do my best to improve my artistic cultivation.\"\n\n\n \"That's good.\"\n\n\n As the Head Priest puts the magic tool on the table, I also put mine, and silently return it to him.\n\n\n \"Then, Sir. Please give me a demo.\"\n\n\n \"Demo?\n\n\n \"How far shall I do in artistic cultivation of the nobles? Please let me know.\"\n\n\n Then, I show him the musical instruments, and plead with the Head Priest to play a song. The Head Priest puts the magic tool back to his pocket with a sigh.\n\n\n \"Fran, fetch the Fespiel.\"\n\n\n \"Ok.\"\n\n\n The large and small instruments displayed in the case are called Fespiel. The large one is for adults and the small one for children.\n\n\n It was an instrument like a combination of both lute and koto, with a similar shape to Bandura, a Ukrainian instrument. The body is shaped like half of a pear, and the back is slightly curved. The surface board has a hole, like a sound hole of a guitar, but is well decorated. The one for adults is decorated with geometric patterns; the one for children is decorated with a creeping ivy.\n\n\n It has 50 to 60 strings. The pins for coiling the strings are made of ivory-like materials, embellishing the wooden musical instruments.\n\n\n The head is a sculptured horse head. I nearly cry out, \"A morinhuur!\" But nobody knows morinhuur in this world, so I keep silent.\n\n\n After adjusting the position of the chair, the Head Priest sits down with his legs aligned, and placed Fespiel between the thighs lightly.\n\n\n While holding the neck with his left hand, he plays the strings with the middle finger of his right hand. The air quivers with a strum, and it sounds like a guitar. When the Head Priest plucks the strings with his right hand like playing a harp, a clear and high-pitched sound comes out and dissolves in the air.\n\n\n It seems that the tuning is done. The Head Priest is ready for the Fespiel, and slightly drops his eyes. He plays the main melody with right hand, and makes deep sounds with left hand like a bass player.\n\n\n … It's wonderful.\n\n\n The Head Priest moves his long fingers freely, and starts playing a melody that I have never heard. Though it is the first time for me to see this musical instrument, and the first time to hear the melody, I can immediately understand that the Head Priest is a virtuoso. People like troubadours loitering around the east gate are not in the same level as him.\n\n\n \"Clear high sky…\"\n\n\n The Head Priest starts to sing accompanied by the melody. It is a song about the growing plants praising the bless of the sun. The lyrics picture a bright scene of life in summer days.\n\n\n … The voice of the Head Priest is too beautiful.\n\n\n I always think the Head Priest is deep-voiced. But when he is singing, his voice is totally different, and is astonishingly dulcet. Indeed, I've never heard the melody, but it comes into my ear smoothly. And I'm charmed by it, and filled with rapture.\n\n\n \"Clang…,\" with the lingering sound of the last note, I exhale a sigh of admiration, the Head Priest hands the Fespiel to Fran.\n\n\n \"Hmm, something like this. Maine, what do you think?\"\n\n\n \"I think that if you sing a love song, plenty girls will run after you.\"\n\n\n \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest stares at me, and I understand that I should not tell the truth. I promptly cover my long-tongued mouth, and then I change into an indirect expression.\n\n\n \"I'm enchanted by the beautiful sound. … but I think it's a bit difficult.\"\n\n\n \"People don't get artistic cultivation at once. We need regular practice. Try little by little.\"\n\n\n Suddenly, the Head Priest starts the Fespiel training. There is no possibility to escape from the Head Priest who is enthusiastic about education, so I take the small Fespiel that Fran hands to me."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The Head Priest has begun my training of Fespiel. What he hands to me is a small Fespiel for children beginners, though it’s still large for me.\n\n\n The strings of a child-specific Fespiel are less than that of adult-specific one. The range, which has about 5 octaves, is about half of adult-specific Fespiel’s. It is about twice Pianica's range.\n\n\n \"If you lean it against your shoulder, this angle will make you feel heavier and heavier. Please try your best to support it as straight as possible.\"\n\n\n \"Ok.\"\n\n\n As the Head Priest does, I lay it between my thighs, supporting it with my upper arm and my left shoulder. The Fespiel is made of wood. No heavy material is used, so I can hold it like this.\n\n\n \"Fespiel can play all the pitches. If you master it, it will be very helpful for you to learn other instruments.\"\n\n\n Perhaps because the small one is for practice, one of the strings is colored. What the Head Priest is touching is just that one.\n\n\n \"This is the basic sound.\"\n\n\n … Oh, it’s the sound Do.\n\n\n When I was Urano Motosu, my mother taught me piano for about three years. I learnt that the basic sound of music is Do, the next is Re, then the next is Mi…\n\n\n There is a difference of a semitone between two thin and soft strings in terms of pitch. Differing from piano, the Fespiel has no black key. So it is very difficult to find the right sound.\n\n\n \"This is the scale. It makes the sound continue, high or low.\"\n\n\n It’s just like remembering the numbers. The basic scales that the Head Priest explains are decoded into Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si in my mind.\n\n\n It will be difficult to play fluently before I get used to it, but since I've known that the colored string is Do, I can play some melodies that I learned before.\n\n\n \"Blossom… Blossom…\"\n\n\n Accompanied by the melody, I chant these words and sing the song \"Tulip\". The Head Priest widens his eyes lightly.\n\n\n \"What is this song?\"\n\n\n \"It's a song for flowers, as you heard.\"\n\n\n There is no tulip in this world, so I'm sure that the Head Priest don't know this flower and will get confused if I tell him about the song \"Tulip\". Thinking of this, I lower my eyes.\n\n\n \"… You must have a music talent.\"\n\n\n \"No, I don't! Not even a little!\"\n\n\n Oops. I've raised the hurdle for myself.\n\n\n In his view, it looks like I can play a piece of melody created by myself, with a musical instrument that I have never touched before. The Head Priest may regard me as a genius like Mozart. Thus it will be a great trouble for me.\n\n\n I can only play some pieces recalled from a few songs which were performed in the school chorus, and several melodies which were heard at piano concerts during my school days. Not because I have the so-called talent for music.\n\n\n \"No, you should not jump to the conclusion by yourself. To be honest, I have been worrying how far a commoner can do. But now I believe that you will play well soon.\"\n\n\n In spite of my desperate negation, the Head Priest begins to make a training plan with a grin, mainly intending to cut down my important reading time.\n\n\n \"Excuse me, Sir. May I have more time to read?\"\n\n\n \"But daily practice is essential for you to master the instrument.\"\n\n\n \"Eh, I know that. But I just cannot sacrifice my reading time.\"\n\n\n I have to take care of the children of the orphanage, and manage Maine's Workshop, and assist the Head Priest in the official business. Fran is also busy with many things. So I won't have so much time even when I stay at the temple. Dinner time is strictly controlled. And the books are locked so I can't borrow or take them out. The time for reading is much less than I thought before I entered the temple.\n\n\n \"When I came to the temple, the Head Priest asked me to provide mana, and to organize the library. As to assisting the Head Priest with official business, I do it out of my own kindness. I would like spend the assistant time, rather than reading time in practicing the Fespiel.\"\n\n\n Considering my words in silence, the Head Priest weighs official business and music training, then he seems to conclude that the latter is more important. He tells me that after I arrive at the temple I need to accept the Fespiel training till the third bell rings.\n\n\n \"Well, let's notify Wilma and Rosina. And then I will come to check occasionally. Please do your best in your practice. If you slack off in practice, I'll know right away.\"\n\n\n \"Ha…\"\n\n\n I'm supervised, just like being stuck by an oversized nail. It's difficult for me to concentrate on practicing an instrument that I'm not interested in without supervision. In that sense, the Head Priest is right indeed.\n\n\n \"Well, then, Miss Maine. Please go to the orphanage. Because you need to notify your attendants Wilma and Rosina.\"\n\n\n After seeing off the Head Priest, I go to the orphanage with Fran. And while we are talking at the orphanage, Delia and Gil clean the room for Rosina.\n\n\n \"Please. Make it clean by the time we are back.\"\n\n\n \"Lutz is always surprised by the Gil's speed of cleaning. Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"Ok!\"\n\n\n I go to the dining hall of the orphanage with Fran, and have somebody call Wilma and Rosina.\n\n\n Children in the orphanage who finished the work of Maine's Workshop are looking at us with curiosity. Maybe they have known why I call the two.\n\n\n \"Does Miss Maine take Wilma away as your attendant?\"\n\n\n \"Will Wilma go?\"\n\n\n Little children stare at me anxiously. I can see that they love Wilma deeply and feel relieved to make her stay at the orphanage.\n\n\n \"Wilma will become my attendant. And, as director of the orphanage, I will have Wilma continue to work in the orphanage. Her job is to take care of you guys.\"\n\n\n \"Wow! \"Really?\"\n\n\n \"So, Wilma will stay, right?\"\n\n\n The cheerful children rush towards Wilma who just showed up in the dining room. They cling to Wilma, pulling her clothes and arms.\n\n\n \"Wilma, you can still stay at the orphanage when you are my attendant!\"\n\n\n \"As Wilma said, Miss Maine managed to do it!\" Fran explains.\n\n\n Crowded by the children, Wilma comes quickly with a happy smile.\n\n\n \"Good afternoon, Miss Mine.\"\n\n\n \"As I said that day, I will take Wilma as my attendant.\"\n\n\n I invite Wilma to have a seat, and tell the children stay away and keep quiet until we finish the talk. The children leave as rolling waves, and line up against the wall, still looking at us with a happy face.\n\n\n Wilma sits in front of me. I can see her calm brown eyes get wet for delight.\n\n\n \"As my attendant, you need to take care of the children who have not received baptism and to draw the picture that I ask. Since the young children may have a fever at night, you will stay here and live in the orphanage. I have talked about it with the Head Priest.\"\n\n\n Now, Wilma can live in the girl's wing of the orphanage. And other blue-robed priests cannot call her for flower offering anymore.\n\n\n \"Thank you. I will work with all my heart for you.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you.\"\n\n\n After talking with Wilma, Rosina appears in the dining room. Her hair is half-up today. I remember it was grouped together behind when I saw her earlier. Her blue eyes are shining brightly and she has fluffy and maroon hair, like Tuuli.\n\n\n \"Good afternoon, Miss Mine.\"\n\n\n Rosina has a beautiful, mature appearance. Since she has not put her hair together, she is not an adult yet. Rosina is a neat lady, with beautiful hair and dignified behavior. When I see Wilma and Rosina, I can imagine their former masters' mode of behavior. They must be adept at arts.\n\n\n … Perhaps, the Head Priest wants me to behave like Rosina.\n\n\n I can understand. But human beings choose their own way of life. How can I compare with the beautiful attendants who refine every behavior, and boast courtesy? I sigh heavily.\n\n\n \"Please be my attendant, Rosina.\"\n\n\n \"Oh!\"\n\n\n Rosina covers her mouth with hands. Her face flushes, as if it is unbelievable. Even though I do the same thing, different people's response is quite different. I drop my eyes slightly.\n\n\n … I think that beautiful Rosina is a little shy.\n\n\n \"The Head Priest asks me to improve artistic cultivation and recommends you as my attendant. We will practice the Fespiel every time when I arrive at the temple, till the third bell rings. The rest of time, you will do the same job as other attendants. What do you think?\"\n\n\n \"Ok. Ok, sure. It's very good. Fespiel is my favorite musical instrument.\"\n\n\n Having finished our talk, I leave the orphanage with Rosina. Wilma and the children see us off. Rosina has no personal luggage at the orphanage. She moves to my house without bringing anything. Her necessities should be prepared by me.\n\n\n When we return, all assistants are waiting on the first floor. Fran takes me to the upstairs. After telling me not to eavesdrop their talk, Fran took Gil and Delia back to the first floor.\n\n\n Then all the attendants gather on the first floor. Fran introduces everyone to Rosina. Apparently, as a master, I shouldn’t eavesdrop on communication between the attendants.\n\n\n Now I'm idle, so I scan the score left by the Head Priest. It is the music for the first lesson. It's not that long, but it's hard to remember the melody which I'm not familiar with.\n\n\n Suddenly, I hear Gil say, \"I'm going to clean up the workshop and check the lock,\" and a sound of leaving the room. After the introduction and guidance on the first floor is over, Fran goes to the second floor with Rosina to show her the room of female attendants. Delia follows them to help Rosina prepare the room.\n\n\n \"Oh! Fespiel… Miss Maine, may I play it now?\"\n\n\n Seeing the large and small Fespiels in the room, Rosina cries with emotion.\n\n\n I know the excitement that one will show when seeing the thing he really wants, so I want to nod immediately. But I am disturbed by Delia's voice.\n\n\n “Well, Rosina! The instrument will not escape. It is better to have the room prepared first.\"\n\n\n \"… Yes, Delia is right.\"\n\n\n It is not good to have Delia help her prepare the room, while she herself strums an instrument.\n\n\n Rosina enters the room while looking at Fespiel with a strong attachment. There is little luggage, so the room will be prepared soon.\n\n\n \"Miss Maine, may I play Fespiel now?\"\n\n\n I nod at Rosina who quickly has the room prepared. Her blue eyes brighten delightedly. She takes the Fespiel, touches it with her thin fingertip, and strums one string gently. As a high sound resounds, Rosina slightly drops her eyes and sighs, listening with an enchanted expression.\n\n\n \"I want to hear Rosina play the Fespiel. Could you please play a song?\"\n\n\n \"Ok.\"\n\n\n Holding the Fespiel, Rosina bows gently and moves her hand down from the top of the Fespiel softly. After an act resembling Ballerina's greeting, Rosina sits in a chair and holds the Fespiel.\n\n\n As Rosina moves her fingers softly to stroke a string, a delicate and melodious sound comes out.\n\n\n Though people play the same instrument, because of the different characteristics of the player, and the different melody, it sounds different from what the Head Priest plays.\n\n\n I've never heard this thin and high-pitched song, but her teary-eyes and slightly opened mouth are all reflecting the joy of being able to play the instrument.\n\n\n \"… It's a very nice performance.\"\n\n\n \"My honor, Miss Maine. I am really happy to perform once again… I will serve you with all my heart.\"\n\n\n Therefore, I have two more attendants, and start my Fespiel training as a daily routine."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The next day, I go to the Gate with my father. We are going out to look for Tau fruit, in order to gather more Tronbay. Lutz goes to the orphanage and brings along the orphans. We will gather at the Gate, and then go to the forest.\n\n\n \"Is it a boy or a girl? Which do you prefer, dad?\"\n\n\n The conversation with my father now is only about the baby. Similar topics are as more as endless. Because I can hardly wait, I cannot help but talk about it. Tuuli recently said, \"It's good that Maine talks to her father more often now.\" But she doesn't talk too much with me.\n\n\n \"… It's difficult to tell. If it's a boy, I'm able to have a company at home finally. If it's a girl, she will be a lovely girl.\"\n\n\n \"I think either will be lovely! I will make a lot of picture books and read them to it.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, I see, I see.\"\n\n\n Soon after we arrive at the gate, Lutz comes, accompanied by the children of the orphanage.\n\n\n \"Lutz, please take care of Maine,\" says father.\n\n\n \"Ok. The boy will carry her on his back,\" Lutz replies.\n\n\n He points at a boy who is strong even among the apprentices. The boy squats, and carries me on his back. If I go on my feet, they will think me a burden. So I don't have any other choice.\n\n\n \"Is it the first time for Miss Maine to go to the forest?\"\n\n\n I nod at Gil, who looks very excited. Because I go to the temple every day, I cannot go to the forest by myself. Lutz's task is very difficult, because he has to take care of the orphans. This time he brings along an apprentice to carry me, so the orphans can walk fast in the forest as well.\n\n\n \"Pick up the Tau fruits, and cut the wood. We can save the money to buy food and firewood for the winter.\"\n\n\n It is even difficult for the four of my families to prepare for the coming winter. I don't know how much it will cost to make winter preparation for the orphanage. Thanks to God's grace, we only need to compensate for the insufficiency, but I'm not sure how much we still need to pay.\n\n\n It is recent years that I started picking firewood in the forest. Let's not discuss the small branches for the present. But the big wood blocks usually cost 1 to 3 years before they become dry firewood. Almost all of this winter's firewood has to be bought.\n\n\n \"It's great that we can stay in a warm room in winter without starving. … But we can't make paper, or go to the forest in winter, right? Then what will we do?\"\n\n\n Basically, the children live in the orphanage, and have no other place to go. They can follow me to have a walk between the orphanage and forest when we make paper. Thus they get the chance to go out to the forest. But we cannot go to the forest in winter, so they can only stay at the orphanage again. Gil pouts for feeling bored.\n\n\n \"I have to think about some handiwork that can be done at the orphanage during the winter.\"\n\n\n Although Tuuli and mother have a contract with Corinna to do the handwork of making hair decoration, they have not contracted with the orphanage to have the children do it. So I'd better think out something new.\n\n\n When I arrive at the forest, all that I have to do is standing at the meeting place. So I walk around, picking up some fruits to taste, and some wood. Then everyone returns with their collections.\n\n\n They have four tau fruits. So many tau fruits, like bloated water balloons, were picked at the Star Festival. Here we can only find very few, which have been cracked by some beasts.\n\n\n I hold the tau fruit handed to me and inject the mana into it. Its shape changes as I watch it. I've got used to this a little. All the children hold the knives or edged tools, in a battle state.\n\n\n \"Go!\"\n\n\n \"Good! Come on! Fast-growing tree!\"\n\n\n When I throw the Tau fruit, the tree surrounded by children begins to sprout.\n\n\n From now on, my duty is done.\n\n\n I will wait till the end. When I am watching the children sitting on a large stone and cutting the tree skillfully, I begin to think about handicrafts for the orphanage.\n\n\n … Suddenly, I remember that last winter I was busy making hair ornaments and directing Lutz's study. …Oh! It may be good to have children learn how to read.\n\n\n Since we have a lot of time, so how about teaching children the letters? I'd better prepare stone boards and textbooks and have a try in the classroom of temple during the winter. I can teach reading, writing and calculation. Now I decide to improve the literacy rate of Maine's Workshop -- a studio for book-making.\n\n\n Literacy is a basic requirement for attendants. But it's alright for children to master it, even if they don't work as attendants in their future.\n\n\n … So, maybe I can ask Wilma to make picture books as children's Scriptures.\n\n\n If the children's Scriptures are converted into easy-to-understand words, they should be easier than ordinary stories for children of the orphanage to understand.\n\n\n Besides, if picture books will be used as textbooks, I want to create a mass-production system here. Because it's impossible for Wilma to draw so many illustrations for so many children, each of whom will have serval books.\n\n\n … However, there is no printing machine.\n\n\n When it comes to mass production, first I think about printing. Either for letterpress or for mimeograph, I have to make the tools from the first step. So I do not know whether it can be done before winter comes.\n\n\n Compared with that of Japanese, basic characters of the language in this world are less. So I think that the letterpress should be somehow manageable.\n\n\n … Hm. But letterpress is difficult, for it's hard to operate the compressor unless the operator is strong enough. If I ask children to operate, maybe mimeograph is better.\n\n\n It would be fine if I ask Johann of the blacksmith workshop to make iron pens. But I don't know how to make stencils. Now is the busiest season of the year for the wax workshop has to prepare for the coming winter. So I don't think that it is available to help me for new products development.\n\n\n … If so, maybe I should choose engraving.\n\n\n Then I decide to make the first textbook with the simplest engraving.\n\n\n I ask Vilma to draw a picture on a board, and then ask the woodwork workshop to carve it. I'm sure many picture books will be easily printed in this way.\n\n\n Meanwhile, I think about the mimeograph. First of all, I have to consider how to make stencils. Making paper is the job of Maine's Workshop.\n\n\n \"Ok, just do it!\"\n\n\n I'm excited upon the plan of making books, and I stand up clenching my fists. Lutz, after putting the Tronbay into the basket, holds a new Tau fruit in his hand, and looks down at me with suspicious expression in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Maine, do not forget to report, contact, and consult before you take any action.\"\n\n\n \"Yes…\"\n\n\n … I'm going to consult Mr. Benno tomorrow, even if Lutz has not looked at me in that way. It's true. I promise."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n I need some boards for wood engraving. So I go to tell Mr. Benno to order 10 boards.\n\n\n \"Good morning! Mr. Benno.\"\n\n\n \"What gets you here this time?\"\n\n\n I go there in high spirits, but meet such doubtful eyes. However, I'm excited by the thought of making books. So I don't care of his attitude, and raise my hand.\n\n\n \"I'm going to make books with woodcuts.\"\n\n\n \"Woodcut?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. When we carve the wood, marks will be left, right? If I wet it with ink and press it on the paper, then the bulges, wetted by the ink, can print letters or pictures on paper.\n\n\n I take out a stone board, and draw a cross section of the wood on it. Then I draw a line representing ink over the cross section, and a line representing paper over the ink line. Mr. Benno frowns while looking at the stone board.\n\n\n \"… I know what you mean, but the ink is too expensive, right? How much ink do you need?\"\n\n\n I go pale on hearing Mr. Benno's words.\n\n\n A small bottle of ink costs four silver coins. Though paper is cheaper than parchment, it still costs too much. I'm excited by the thought of making books, but I neglect an important thing - considering the high cost, it's impossible to make so many books. At the best, I may make some printed paper for children, instead of textbooks.\n\n\n \"I haven't considered the cost.\"\n\n\n \"Foolish! Is there any merchant who does not count the cost?!\"\n\n\n \"… Look, I am an apprentice priestess instead of a merchant.\"\n\n\n I murmur. He pinches my cheek. He doesn't even make allowance for a little girl.\n\n\n \"Hurt! hurt!\"\n\n\n \"Noisy child.\"\n\n\n I think Mr. Benno often acts like a child. I stroke my cheek when he finally he loosens his pinch, and ask him to introduce me to the ink workshop.\n\n\n \"I have to consider both quantity and cost. Please introduce a good ink workshop to me.\"\n\n\n \"Ok, I see.\"\n\n\n \"… In the worst case, we have to make ink by ourselves from the first step. Because I'm not sure whether there will be suitable ink for printing …\"\n\n\n There seems to be a long way to go before making a book. My excitement vanishes with a sigh.\n\n\n \"You also know how to make ink?\"\n\n\n \"… I know the method. Let's make it and the paper. We did not have the materials prepared before. Now I think I am able to prepare them one by one. Besides, I have so many partners… We might make some mistakes in allocating the proportion of the materials. But if we have enough time, I think it manageable.\"\n\n\n \"Well…\"\n\n\n When I'm leaving the workshop, Mark comes to tell me that he has given Lutz the cardboard for the orphanage.\n\n\n Then I sign the receipt, and take the cardboard to the temple. Because I need to give it to Wilma and let her draw the pictures. I go there not only to ask her for pictures, but also see her smile, a saint-like smile which can always comfort me.\n\n\n When I arrived at the temple, Gil is waiting by the gate. Fran is not there. Recently Gil always goes to Maine's Workshop, and seldom come here.\n\n\n Gil seems relieved when he sees me.\n\n\n \"Good morning, Miss Maine.\"\n\n\n \"Good morning, Gil. It has been a long time since I met you here last time. What brings you here?\"\n\n\n \"… From now on I will come here often. Delia is waiting for you fretfully.\"\n\n\n He says, shrugging his shoulders. Hearing this, I feel as if the air around me has stopped.\n\n\n \"Though Fran is pacifying her, I'm still afraid when she will lost control. She just keeps complaining.\"\n\n\n \"… What happened?\"\n\n\n \"The new attendant named … Rosina, right? She is a little troublesome,\" Gil sighs tiredly.\n\n\n Yesterday, we went to the forest. What happened to Delia and Rosina? It's a little like when one buys a new pet, it is necessary to care for the old one. They may fight for the space possession.\n\n\n I haven't fed any pet, and just learn only a little from books. While I walk to my room, I begin to think about an appropriate way to deal with it.\n\n\n Gil opens the door for me as usual. The beautiful sound of Fespiel comes out of the room.\n\n\n … The two of them are just like cats, instead of tame dogs. For example, Delia's attitude changes according to the surrounding situation, just like a tortoiseshell. Rosina is quiet and virtuous. Can you feel that?\n\n\n Well, thinking of these questions, I go upstairs. Delia does not rush out before I enter the room. There is even no sign of a quarrel inside, so I'm completely off-guard.\n\n\n On the second floor, Delia flies into a rage suddenly.\n\n\n \"Nuisance--!\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n \"What's wrong with you? Rosina!\"\n\n\n Delia lets out a loud \"Nuisance!\" when we see each other. I'm surprised and thinking, \"What's wrong with Delia?\" I look around the room. Rosina still sits in the chair, playing the Fespiel, and doesn't cares about the \"What!\".\n\n\n \"… Good morning, Delia. Excuse me. I don't understand. Can you explain?\"\n\n\n \"Rosina almost does nothing at all!\"\n\n\n Pointing at Rosina, Delia bursts out the word \"Nuisance!\" again. I glance at Rosina. She is still looking at the Fespiel.\n\n\n \"Good morning, Rosina.\"\n\n\n \"… Miss Maine, good morning. It's a good day today, right? It's sunny and cool.\"\n\n\n As she says so, she finally stops playing Fespiel and looks at me. Rosina acts as if she has not seen Delia. So, I understand they are angry with each other.\n\n\n \"Rosina, Delia seems angry. Why don't you do your work?\"\n\n\n \"Well, she is smearing my good name by telling others that I don't do my work. Aren't I practicing the Fespiel?\"\n\n\n Rosina says, tilting her head to one side in a gentle manner. Delia clenches her teeth while taking out the blue robe, saying,\n\n\n \"Have you done anything other than practicing your Fespiel?\"\n\n\n \"Because I'm an attendant of Miss Maine, I do it for sure.\"\n\n\n \"What ----! Miss Maine, this is all that Rosina can say. It's ridiculous. She even doesn't listen to Fran! Please do something!"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Delia dresses me and tidies my clothes roughly with a rustle.\n\n\n \"Miss Maine, I can't talk with one who is not able to understand the job of a priestess. Well, we are running out of time. Let's practice Fespiel.\"\n\n\n Rosina is preparing my Fespiel with a graceful smile. Delia's anger is completely neglected by her.\n\n\n \"What ----! It's not the time to practice the instrument!\"\n\n\n \"Delia, it is decided by the Head Priest that it will be the practice time until the third bell rings. Before that, think carefully about what you want to say. Rosina's job is to teach me Fespiel. Let's talk about other tasks later. \"\n\n\n \"… Ok.\"\n\n\n With an upset look, Delia goes to do her own work. Just before going down the stairs, she turns around and says, \"I will definitely talk about it later!\"\n\n\n \"Miss Maine, you don't have to listen to that kind of blather.\"\n\n\n \"No, when people are at odds, I have to listen to the details of everyone's explanation. The Head Priest told me this.\"\n\n\n \"… Is that so?\"\n\n\n Rosina puts on a gloomy face, but as soon as she starts playing Fespiel, her smile comes back. Rosina has been teaching me how to play before the third bell rings.\n\n\n Then the Fespiel practice is over. I have to go to help the Head Priest on his official duties. Rosina puts the Fespiel back to the case for me. After I ring the bell on the table and call Fran, he comes up to the second floor with all the necessary tools ready.\n\n\n \"Well, I will go to help the Head Priest. Rosina and Delia, you two please go to fetch the water together.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, what are you talking about? Isn't that the job for gray-robed priests?\"\n\n\n Rosina's eyes widen, as if I say something unbelievable, but I also look at her with surprise.\n\n\n My gray-robed priests are Fran and Gil. Fran is in charge of all the clerical work, and Gil takes care of the workshop. They have been working outside.\n\n\n Now, only Delia is responsible for the housework, so I want Rosina to help her.\n\n\n Because Rosina will soon become an adult. I want to ask her to share Fran's job, but I am not sure what kind of job Rosina can do. Thus, I think she can start with the work which is simple for any gray-robed priestess.\n\n\n \"The gray-robed priests have their own work. For the time being, Rosina will work with Delia. That's what Fran told Delia, right?\"\n\n\n Hearing my words, Delia smooths out her red hair with both hands, and smiles triumphantly.\n\n\n \"So, I ask you to take the water to the second floor as it's our work, right?\"\n\n\n \"I think that rough work should be done by gentlemen.\"\n\n\n Rosina puts her hands on her cheeks, inclining her head to one side with a confused look.\n\n\n Delia said that even one becomes an attendant, she must do some rough work while she is an apprentice. I assign the work based on Delia's words. But when I see Rosina's response, I feel uneasy.\n\n\n \"Heavy work and chores should be priests' work. The work of priestesses should be study of accomplishment, right? Putting the orphanage days aside, I become an attendant because of a musical instrument, so I don't know the reason why I have to do the rough work. My fingers may hurt because of it.\"\n\n\n \"Will your fingers hurt? You are not a blue-robed priestess. What are you talking about?!\"\n\n\n Though I understand what Rosina is really thinking, her intention is unfit in my house.\n\n\n \"The priests here can deal with the rough work. Besides, though there is a priestess apprentice in this house, no one understands art here.\"\n\n\n Rosina giggles, but what she says is not funny at all. Now I can understand why Delia was furious.\n\n\n \"Miss Maine, let's talk about it after lunch. The Head Priest is waiting for you.\"\n\n\n When I'm thinking how to solve this problem quickly, Fran's words wake me up. This is an urgent problem that I should deal with.\n\n\n \"Rosina, it is the time for music practice before the third bell rings. But after that, you should work together with other attendants. I've told you that. So, go to work with Delia, please.\"\n\n\n \"Why, Miss Maine?! What are you talking about?!\"\n\n\n Rosina's eyes widen in surprise as if she can't believe that her advice should be rejected so rudely.\n\n\n \"After lunch, I will ask for the opinions of all our attendants. I don't know much about how things work in the temple. I'll make a decision according to their opinions.\"\n\n\n If she asks for my personal opinion, I will say \"what you did in the past, does not mean what you should do now\". However, is this Rosina's opinion, right? How about others? I have to know that. Without asking people like Fran or the Head Priest, I cannot make a decision arbitrarily. I leave to ask the Head Priest for his advice.\n\n\n \"What do you think of Rosina's opinion, Fran?\"\n\n\n After we leave the room, heading for the Head Priest's, I ask Fran. Just now, all I considered was that Delia was furious. So I didn't ask others for their opinions. In some way, the conversation this afternoon seemed to be entirely controlled by Delia.\n\n\n … Gil says Delia's complaint is endless.\n\n\n \"I think she is affected greatly by her previous master. Miss Christine, Wilma and Rosina's former master, is one of those rare people even among the blue-robed priestesses. She attaches great importance to art. She likes writing poems and painting, and is absorbed in music every day. Her attendants - all gray-robed priestesses, including priestess apprentices, learnt to behave like ladies of the noble families.\"\n\n\n … She is absorbed in poetry, painting and music every day. Really?\n\n\n \"As Rosina says, at Miss Christine's house, those who are good at arts will be treated better than others, so Rosina almost lived a life of a gray-robed priestess.\"\n\n\n \"… Now I can understand why she looks like a well-bred lady.\"\n\n\n Every gray-robed priestess should learn how to love and serve his/her master. I know this because Delia and Gil told me before. So, I think the gray-robed priestesses are all like that. However, Rosina was treated like a blue-robed priestess because her master liked art. She is no more than a gray-robed priestess apprentice who is good at art but does not do the rough work. I'm really surprised by such a priestess."

What is the work of attendants?\"\n\n\n \"Fran.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest asks Fran for an explanation before answering my question. Fran briefly tells him the dispute between Rosina and Delia.\n\n\n The Head Priest also feels speechless when hearing Rosina refuses to do other work except art-related work.\n\n\n \"… Ah. I wonder how a gray-robed priestess apprentice can be so elegant and well educated. It turns out that they used to live a life better than the well-bred ladies of lower-rank nobles.\"\n\n\n \"Sir, what kind of person is Miss Christine like?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest stands up, rubbing his temples, and then takes a book from his bookcase. It looks like a file about blue-robed priests. After leafing through the file with his long fingers, he finally stops at a document which he is looking for.\n\n\n \"This one. Christine is the daughter of a concubine, but she has strong mana. Her father wants to get custody of her. Because his lawful wife objected firmly, he sent this daughter to the temple for better education and protection.\"\n\n\n \"For education?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest closes the folder, hands it to Arnaud, then turns round and looks at me.\n\n\n \"Well, she thinks she will go back to her father someday. So private teachers and art tutors often go to her room. Compared with those blue-robed priests who are left with no financial power or weak mana, she really has a different life.\"\n\n\n So, she is a special blue-robed priestess, who brought up the special gray-robed priestess. So, it's better not to treat Rosina's advice as that of a normal gray-robed priestess.\n\n\n \"Excuse me, Sir. I cannot feed an attendant who knows nothing but art. May I ask her to do the same work as Delia does?\"\n\n\n To tell the truth, I don't need an attendant who does nothing but play the Fespiel and lives an elegant life better than mine. I also want to spend all my days in the library, but I have to work.\n\n\n \"It is natural that different masters have different demands on their attendants. It's alright to say so to Rosina. Didn't Fran say anything to her?\"\n\n\n Fran shakes his head slowly, with a bitter expression.\n\n\n \"She doesn't listen to anyone. Rosina doesn't regard herself as an apprentice. She even talks with me in a bossy way. She seems to look down upon the gray-robed priests.\"\n\n\n \"… Well, that sounds awful.\"\n\n\n All the routine duties of my house are directed by Fran. If she refuses to follow Fran's direction, I cannot take her as an attendant. I really want her to return to the orphanage as soon as possible.\n\n\n \"What troubles me the most is that she plays the musical instrument till late at night. I can endure it at the first night, because I know she has not played it for a long time. But the next day she continued. That's indeed … I'm not able to stand it while I live on the first floor. Delia who lives next to her may feel it more intolerable.\"\n\n\n She is a noisy girl. Besides, she does not work.\n\n\n \"Sir, may I return her to the orphanage when I have no choice? If I can do nothing to make Rosina change her mind, would you please take her back? I will pay the tuition, so it will be better if I go there to practice the Fespiel in training hours.\"\n\n\n \"… Attendants who refuse to follow their masters are useless. Even I don't want to take her back.\"\n\n\n Hearing the Head Priest's words, I have an eye contact with Fran, and nod slightly.\n\n\n \"Gather all our attendants after lunch. We will have a meeting. Before that, I want to learn the opinion of Wilma, another attendant in the orphanage. Thank you very much. We have to go now, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Well. It is important to learn the opinions from all members. See you.\"\n\n\n \"Has she grown up a bit? No, I still need to watch her for a while.\" While the Head Priest is murmuring, I get out of the house and head for the orphanage.\n\n\n Wilma and Rosina served the same master before. So maybe she will give me some advice on Rosina's side.\n\n\n I send someone to call Wilma and decide to have a talk in the dining hall. Fran goes into the room to take the board for making cards. Wilma can talk freely when Fran is absent. Because he is an adult male.\n\n\n \"… I want to learn the opinions of all my attendants this afternoon. You are unwilling to live in my house, so I come to ask for your opinion. I wonder whether you do not want to do the rough work to avoid hurting your hands as well, since you and Rosina served the same master Christine before.\"\n\n\n The first one who rushes to wash children's dirt always is Wilma. Though I don't think Wilma will reject the rough work, I still want to know the response of Miss Christine's another attendant.\n\n\n \"Miss Maine, my job is to take care of the children. I'll not get this done if I don't want to do rough work.\"\n\n\n Looking at me calmly, Wilma answers. Seeing her firm eyes, I breathe a sigh of relief, and then ask her about Rosina.\n\n\n I'm really glad that Wilma is not the type of person who doesn't want to do rough work. I wonder if it's only Rosina who doesn't want to do the rough work.\n\n\n \"… That's right. I think maybe Rosina just has a stronger sense of self-respect compared with other gray-robed priestesses,\" Wilma thinks for a while and says so.\n\n\n \"I was chosen to become an attendant apprentice when I was ten. But Rosina was chosen not long after she left the orphanage and almost did no rough work before she returned. When she was at Miss Christine's house, all the chores and heavy work were done by the gray-robed priests, as Rosina said.\"\n\n\n When Rosina was a child, there still were gray-robed priestesses who took care of the children before their baptism. Then it's not because Rosina really doesn't want to do the rough work, but because she was brought up like that. She is more like a girl from a well-off family compared with me.\n\n\n \"… Because Miss Christine is simply absorbed in arts, she gives preferential treatment to the attendants who good at arts, not just according to their seniority. It was natural for us at that time.\"\n\n\n That's why Wilma said they were always devoted to performing arts to buy the master's delight.\n\n\n \"After Miss Christine returns to the nobles' society, Rosina was surprised at the life of the orphanage. It is only when I return to the orphanage to hear what others told me, that I came to know that our experiences were different from theirs by then.\"\n\n\n Wilma, who had the experience of rough work before she was ten, could accept the reality of her special experience. But Rosina could not face the grim reality.\n\n\n \"Rosina wanted to go back to her life of music, but there was no opportunity. She understood that if she was chosen by a blue-robed priest as a flower offering priestess, her life would be completely different. But this time she is chosen by you - Miss Maine, a priestess apprentice like Miss Christine, so Rosina becomes obsessed with an idea of living the same life as before.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you very much for your valuable opinion, Wilma.\"\n\n\n Noticing that Fran has been back, I get up and ready to leave. Wilma crosses her hands in front of her chest and bows slightly.\n\n\n \"Miss Maine, if possible, please give Rosina some time to think and correct herself.\"\n\n\n \"… This is a request from Wilma. I will consider it as much as I can.\"\n\n\n I will consider, but I do not intend to change the basic attitude that I do not need an attendant who does not work. As it is said by Gil and the children of the orphanage, \"no work, no food.\""

    "content": " \n\n\n\n My name is Wilma. I will be 17 years old this autumn, so I am 16 years old now.\n\n\n I became an attendant of Miss Maine, a blue-robed priestess apprentice, several days ago. I am entrusted with the work of taking care of the children who have not been baptized yet.\n\n\n \"Is everyone here? Let's pray and thank God for the grace. To the supreme gods who rule over all in the high, lofty skies, to the great gods who rule over all in the wide, vast earth, and to all the gods who grant sustenance to the thousands of living creatures, we offer our heartfelt thanks for this meal.\"\n\n\n The young children begin to sing with me and then start the lunch. Everyone seems hungry and concentrate on eating. Because I have already finished mine, now I just teach them how to eat and clean up the table. However, it is surprisingly difficult to look after all the six children at the same time.\n\n\n \"Today's rice is delicious, too.\"\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n The meals taken to the orphanage are eaten by adult priests and priestesses first, and then by the apprentices. Then the food left finally is eaten by the children who have not been baptized. So they have to wait till the last.\n\n\n I feel sorry for these children. Because they have been waiting for so long that they are too hungry. On the other hand, though children have so few things to eat, it is better than having nothing. This makes me feel better.\n\n\n \"The soup is delicious.\"\n\n\n \"We have all the vegetables today. Maybe they are cooked by Lizzie?\"\n\n\n On days blessed by the God and the other days, when I see the soup that is provided every day, I can think of Miss Maine. The soup means almost everything that changes the condition of the orphanage.\n\n\n \"Miss Maine taught me how to make this soup. Some ingredients are picked from the forest, and some are bought with our income.\"\n\n\n \"Wilma is always like this. What will you do then? Please thank Miss Maine.\"\n\n\n Children joke with me and laugh. Yes, it is none other than Miss Maine whom the children should thank first. Now they have baths, have food, and have the chance to go out to the forest with us.\n\n\n Cleaning is rough work for the blue-robed priests and priestesses. But since the blue-robed priests does not come the orphanage, this place has never been well cleaned so far. I have no time to clean the surroundings, so all I can do is to clean the places nearby every now and then.\n\n\n That's why the rooms for priestesses and priestess apprentices and cafeteria are not so dirty to make people frown. But there is nobody who can bath the children who have not been baptized, or clean their surroundings. Since it is the duty of those gray-robed priestesses who have babies to take care of these children, I have not thought about or even noticed these things.\n\n\n I don't think that only I was surprised to hear the situation of the children who haven’t received Baptism from Miss Maine's attendant, Fran. I also learn from the people outside the orphanage that there is no priestess to take care of those children, and that the apprentices only leave little food in the plates, which is cared by nobody.\n\n\n \"Wilma, will you go to the workshop after finishing the work here?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, after you wash your dishes and clean your hands and face. If you stain paper, you will be scolded by Gil.\"\n\n\n \"I think Lutz is scarier than Gil.\"\n\n\n I heard that someone was scolded or fired by Gil who takes charge of Maine's Workshop. But I only know that Lutz, the merchant apprentice who often comes to the workshop, is trusted by Miss Maine.\n\n\n \"Right, right. How many days and efforts do you want to spend on this sheet!? He will be angry, right?\"\n\n\n \"Well, do you know how much it costs!? Don't touch the goods with dirty hands! Like this, he gets angry before I touch it. If you smudge the goods, he will not bring you to the forest next time.\"\n\n\n \"It is said that Lutz uses violence recently. He should not use violence. First, he warns. If you cannot understand what he says, he would act violently, and then would say it's your fault.\"\n\n\n I'm not good at communicating with men, so I rarely go to the workshop. Although the workshop is inside the temple, it is quite different. Miss Maine, integrating the rules of merchants and that of the temple, makes her own rules.\n\n\n … Recently, it seems that the orphanage director, Miss Maine often acts in her own way.\n\n\n She cleans the orphanage like cleaning the temple. She cooks in person in order to satisfy all children to some extent. She does not wait for the God's grace but earns money by herself.\n\n\n Miss Maine teaches us that these things are what all commoners should do.\n\n\n She always says, \"I just tell you how to make it. It's not I, but you all, who make our life better and better.\" However, in this temple, a place where live the nobles and orphans only, who else would teach us anything? Thanks to the God who allows Miss Maine to teach us.\n\n\n I'm often complimented by Miss Maine for taking care of the children. She says I am like a saint. But for me, she is a saintess. … No, she looks more like a child of God.\n\n\n Thinking of this, I laugh unconsciously. Then I recall the conversation with Miss Maine this morning. It was about Rosina, who becomes her attendant together with me on the same day.\n\n\n On attendants' role, Miss Maine has different point of view from Miss Christine. Rosina, who was regarded as the first attendant of Miss Christine, has difficulty to serve Miss Maine. Although Miss Maine said she would \"consider\" my suggestion, I can feel that Rosina may be sent back to the orphanage.\n\n\n Rosina is a real beauty. She has a mature face and fluffy chestnut hair. Her eyes are as blue as sapphire. Miss Christine who loves beautiful things or people likes her very much.\n\n\n Besides, she and Miss Christine are of the same age, both are interested in art and are born with the artistic talent. So, Miss Christine, who left her families and came to the temple, treated Rosina as her close friend.\n\n\n Miss Maine also takes Rosina as her attendant, but there seems no way for her to accept Rosina.\n\n\n \"…That’s roughly the situation.\"\n\n\n After lunch, Miss Maine comes to tell me that she has something to talk with me, for she is going to ask the opinions of all her attendants. If Rosina refuses to change her attitude, it will be in trouble for her.\n\n\n After meal, I send children to the workshop and take the board to make the cards in my room. These cards are gifts from Miss Maine for children. So I must paint as better as I can. I can't wait for the chance to put my skill to the test.\n\n\n The cards Miss Maine prepared for Gil to remember the letters are excellent. Gil often takes it to the cafeteria proudly and play it with us together. Thus children can remember the words or names of the Gods naturally while they are playing with the cards. Besides, what I draw are the gods and goddesses. I can remember all their features. But as for painting them on the cards, it makes me nervous.\n\n\n The board is smooth after being polished. I start drawing the Gods and virtual articles on it with the ink and pens that Miss Maine gives me. I was required to read the chants on the cards so many times, but I can hardly remember any of it. Even if I don't know, children can answer my question and tell me what pictures they like.\n\n\n I enjoy the time of taking care of children. However, it's a special experience to feel the excitement when I concentrate on drawing. I know how much I'm longing for drawing.\n\n\n When I have just finished several pictures, there is someone knocking at the door. Yes, finally. I urge myself to work faster while I am considering. As I expected, Rosina comes. As soon as she enters the room and closes the door, tears drop from her blue eyes. How many tears has she refrained on earth?\n\n\n \"Wilma, Miss Maine is very unkind. She asks me to do the gray-robed priests' work!\"\n\n\n \"Rosina, I just cannot understand that. Can you tell me what happened?\"\n\n\n \"Of course. The only one who can understand me is you, Wilma. You were the attendant of Miss Christine, just as I was.\"\n\n\n I stop my work and turn the chair to face my bed. She sits on the bed, and thus we can face each other. Then she begins to tell her experience with tears rolling down her face.\n\n\n \"The unkindest one is Delia.\"\n\n\n \"I don't know Delia, Rosina. I have not known all Miss Maine's attendants yet. Can you tell me what kind of person is Delia?\""

    "content": " \n\n\n\n After becoming Miss Maine's attendant, I am busy in the orphanage. So I can only hear some news from children from their talks during dinner time. When Fran and Gil come to clean the orphanage, I know they work for Miss Maine as her attendants. They are well-known so that I have heard their names before and can recognize them. But the name of Delia is new to me.\n\n\n \"Delia was a priestess apprentice of the Temple Chief before. She is an aggressive girl, with red hair.\"\n\n\n When I was returned to the orphanage at 8 years old, I lived in the basement. However, I cannot recall any apprentice with such a striking feature of red hair.\n\n\n \"I have seen lots of apprentices since I was 8-year-old, but I'm not able to remember anyone with red hair.\"\n\n\n \"Delia was taken away by the Temple Chief after she was baptized. So she did not live in the first floor of the orphanage, but went to the noble area. I don't know her, either. When I asked her, she told me that proudly. She says without shyness that one day she will become a mistress. What if Miss Christine hear this?\"\n\n\n Miss Christine don't like the gray-robed priestesses who perform flower offering. Because flower offering is a job only done by females who have nothing special. So I don't want to be taken in by a blue-robed priest.\n\n\n However, the gray-robed priestesses in the orphanage do not seem to dislike flower offering so much. They say that all they want is a better life to have enough food, no matter what they are asked to do; a mistress or flower offering doesn’t matter. Because their present life is only full of rough work, with little blessing from the God.\n\n\n \"Delia did not have the gray-robed priestess to take care of her. She was only a child, who should have lived in the basement, but was chosen from the orphanage to live a comfortable life. Don't you think it unbelievable? Rosina, if it was you that was closed in the basement, what would you think?\"\n\n\n \"No, Wilma. It would make me sick.\"\n\n\n Rosina is always the first to escape whenever she is asked to clean the females' dormitory, let alone helping children living in the basement to bathe. She is affected by Miss Christine so deeply, and only wants to see beautiful things.\n\n\n Occasionally, I cannot stop myself sighing at her difference from Miss Maine, who saw children's condition and asked Gil to help them as possible as he could.\n\n\n \"Delia has no courtesy, knows nothing about the art, and feels Fespiel noisy. 'What! What!' she always shouts. Though Delia herself is noisy, Miss Maine just smiles embarrassedly but does not scold her…\"\n\n\n I think Rosina and Delia are the same type. Because both of them prefer to live in the noble area, rather than do rough work in the temple. However, usually, the job of apprentices’ attendants is to do the rough work for their masters. So, differing from Rosina, my impression on Delia is not so bad.\n\n\n \"Besides, Delia speaks ill of me in front of Miss Maine.\"\n\n\n Rosina tells me what Delia complained in the meeting. Most of what she says is repeated again and again. This further makes me sense her restlessness and anger at Delia.\n\n\n \"What do other people say about Delia? Do they say that Delia is right? Is there anyone who says that he or she is on your side?\"\n\n\n \"Gil is Delia’s friend. He always complains rudely. He says I don't work but eat only, and asks me not to play musical instrument at night…\"\n\n\n When I worked for Miss Christine, Rosina often played Fespiel late at night, but nobody complained. Delia and Gil are apprentices, so they must sleep as early as the children in the orphanage.\n\n\n \"I think playing instruments at night is noisy for children of that age. If you play the instrument in children's room of the orphanage, I will feel trouble, too.\"\n\n\n \"Wilma?!\"\n\n\n \"Though at Miss Christine's house you don't have to get up early, it's different at Miss Maine's house, right? They have to get up as early as the children in the orphanage do.\"\n\n\n Rosina slightly lowers her eyes. Maybe someone else have said the same words.\n\n\n \"Besides, I only remember Gil is a naughty boy who is always beyond control. But my impression on him changes a lot.\"\n\n\n I can't recall any gray-robed priest, who does all the rough work for the temple, has ever been put into the introspection room. When people in the orphanage heard that Gil became a priestess's attendant, they quite doubted about that.\n\n\n \"You will feel more surprised if you see Gil kneels down in front of Miss Maine and is commended by her.\"\n\n\n I have seen the obsessed expression of Gil who hasn’t seen Miss Maine for a long time. I think Gil works hard for Miss Maine and keeps a good relationship with her, because he can often be rewarded with cards or something.\n\n\n \"Has Fran said anything? He used to be the attendant of the Head Priest, and is different from the children. Has he judged the matter fairly?\"\n\n\n As everyone in the orphanage knows, Fran used to be the Head Priest's attendant, and now helps, instructs and guides the commoner Miss Maine. He is also Miss Maine's only adult gray-robed priest. Obviously, Miss Maine trusts him and relies on him.\n\n\n \"Fran is a gray-robed priest, but he does not work even if he is directed to do. He does not do the rough work either. And he also gives me orders.\"\n\n\n \"… It's natural that Fran orders you, right?\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n Rosina tilts her head to one side with a blank look, as if she really does not know the reason. Now I can understand why Rosina arouses hostility of Miss Maine's attendants, and why Miss Maine comes to talk with me about this.\n\n\n \"Because Fran is Miss Maine's first attendant, while Rosina is a new apprentice.\"\n\n\n \"But I am a Fespiel teacher…\"\n\n\n \"Rosina, Miss Maine is different from Miss Christine. Although you are doing the same thing, I don't think you have been accepted.\"\n\n\n \"… Miss Maine also said so.\"\n\n\n \"I can't become a lady like Miss Christine,\" Miss Maine said so to Rosina indeed.\n\n\n \"What else has she told you?\"\n\n\n \"Things like, 'Don't play a musical instrument late at night, for it causes trouble to everyone. You should stop playing by the time when the seventh bell rings. I know you have to protect your hands for playing musical instruments. If you don't do the rough work, I hope you can do some routine work’.\"\n\n\n \"Routine work?\"\n\n\n Rosina nods when I ask her.\n\n\n \"There are not enough attendants at Miss Maine's house. So Fran is in charge of all the routine work, Gil is in charge of the workshop and the male's dormitory, and Delia is in charge of all the housework.\"\n\n\n \"… It's not enough indeed.\"\n\n\n They are supposed to be the attendants who take care of Miss Maine's life. But now Miss Maine becomes the orphanage director, and the workshop head. They have too much work which covers many branches, but people who can help them are too few.\n\n\n \"Wilma is in charge of female's dormitory and painting, right? I'm ordered to be responsible for music and other work. But I don't have enough time even on music.\"\n\n\n It's embarrassing for an attendant who cannot do the attendants' work. Rosina is almost an adult. Miss Maine says that she wants her to do part of Fran's work. It should be understood that they are short of hands. Besides, different masters require different capacities.\n\n\n \"What is routine work?\"\n\n\n \"She asks me to write documents, and to balance the books of the house, workshop and orphanage. She wants me to share Fran's burden.\"\n\n\n \"That's good. Gil and Delia have just become attendants, so reading and writing must be difficult for them. They must think you are almost an adult, and well educated…\"\n\n\n Huh, I sigh.\n\n\n Rosina will have a chance to learn reading, writing and calculation after she becomes an attendant of Miss Maine. When Rosina served Miss Christine, she practiced calligraphy and wrote poetry, but she had no experience of writing documents. Besides, she is so weak in calculation that she almost knows nothing about that. She is really an attendant specializing in art only.\n\n\n The weakness, which has never been noticed so far, now is showing up."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"Though increasing the attendants is a better way to ease the burden, they want me to learn what I can't. … It's not bad to learn to do the things which I have not mastered yet, but Miss Maine said abruptly that she doesn't need an attendant who does not work.\n\n\n \"Yes, that's right. Different from Miss Christine, Miss Maine is a commoner. She is not a noble. So she does not have enough financial power to afford a team with more than 10 attendants.\n\n\n All she considers is earning money by themselves in order to buy enough food for children who have not been baptized in the orphanage. I don't think she has enough money to keep enough attendants as she needs.\n\n\n \"Miss Maine is a blue-robed priestess, right? It's impossible to …\"\n\n\n \"The blue-robed priest in the temple has 5 attendants, right? Miss Christine is special.\"\n\n\n Usually, they have 3~5 attendants. Besides, they will hire cooks and assistants.\n\n\n But they cannot be compared with Miss Christine, who had 2 waitresses sent from her home, 6 gray-robed priestesses for arts, 4 gray-robed priests for rough work and routine work, and several others including cooks, assistants and tutors.\n\n\n \"Rosina, maybe you are unsuited to Miss Maine as an attendant. It's not good for you to live together while complaining with each other.\"\n\n\n \"Do you also advise me to go back to the orphanage?\"\n\n\n \"So far, the criteria you have considered are different. I think Miss Maine has one choice only.\"\n\n\n Yes, finally, I feel relieved. Miss Maine also told her to return to the orphanage.\n\n\n \"… Miss Maine asks me to think about it till tomorrow. She told me to make a choice: go back to the orphanage, or accept the environment different from Miss Christine's.\"\n\n\n \"Well. It depends on you, finally.\"\n\n\n Miss Maine agrees to my suggestion and gives Rosina some time for consideration. I have nothing to say since she has compromised so far. All that Rosina has to do is making a choice.\n\n\n \"Wilma … Don't you think there is anything wrong to ask a priestess do priests' work?\"\n\n\n Seeing that I start painting, Rosina asks me anxiously. She looks bewildered, because even I, who served Miss Christine with her before, do not support her.\n\n\n \"No, I think that's natural at any house other than Miss Christine's.\"\n\n\n \"… Then it must be my fault.\"\n\n\n Rosina murmurs, complaining. Miss Christine means everything for her. Rosina knew nothing about life of the orphanage when she left. Since she came back, she has been yearning for the lifestyle which she had lived with Miss Christine before. So, it's hard to deny all that she had been taught.\n\n\n But since that kind of life has been gone, she has to understand that things taught by Miss Christine can hardly be used at anywhere else.\n\n\n \"Rosina, it's not your fault. What Miss Christine required is practical only at Miss Christine's house. On the contrary, what Miss Maine requires is practical only at Miss Maine's house.\n\n\n \"Practical …?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Rosina. Think about is. If you were taken away by other blue-robed priests as an attendant, maybe you wouldn't even have a musical instrument. Even flower offering would become your work. Can you express your dissatisfaction?\"\n\n\n It wouldn't be accepted if a gray-robed priestess argues with excuses like \"I won't go because there is no musical instrument\", or \"Flower offering is done by the priestesses who are not well educated\".\n\n\n \"Miss Maine doesn't forbid music, right? She just says that you cannot spend all day on music. She wants you to work with other attendants. She takes your advice for fear of hurting your fingers and suggests you remember the routine work. You said you would serve Miss Maine with your whole heart. Is it lip service?\"\n\n\n It's easy to fire an attendant who refuses to follow the master's advice. But I can feel that Miss Maine has compromised as possible as she can.\n\n\n \"You have made your master give in. If you are still disaffected, it means you can only be Miss Christine's attendant. So, before you cause too much trouble to others, it will be better for you to go back to the orphanage.\"\n\n\n Rosina weeps in a daze, as if giving up all hope. Her long eyelashes lower slightly.\n\n\n \"… I can't go back to those years even though I become an attendant of a priestess apprentice.\"\n\n\n \"Right, because Miss Christine has been gone. Anybody else cannot become Miss Christine.\"\n\n\n While I have completed painting on several pieces of paper, Rosina is still sitting on my bed, drooping her head and weeping quietly. I leave her alone when she keeps weeping as if she is driving away various kinds of feelings, till her tears dry naturally.\n\n\n \"… Wilma.\"\n\n\n When Rosina raises her head, I can sense the determination from her eyes.\n\n\n The determination of letting go of the past, to which she has clung so far, and looking firmly ahead makes her so beautiful that I feel regret not to have painting tools at hand.\n\n\n \"I cannot leave music. So I will return to Miss Maine. Besides, I will remember those routine work.\"\n\n\n \"If you work hard, you will be accepted by Miss Maine, just like the first time when you were praised at the orphanage… Maybe all that I can do is just listening though, may you be successful.\"\n\n\n A few days later, Miss Maine comes to the orphanage, smiling delightfully. Although Miss Maine is a priestess apprentice, she has a build no stronger than the children who have not received baptism here.\n\n\n \"You gave her advice, right? Rosina works very hard to memorize the calculation, though she is not good at it. Thank you, Wilma.\"\n\n\n Miss Maine smiles ingenuously, with her golden eyes squinting. She looks so cute that I want to lift her with my hands. But she is my master.\n\n\n Since Miss Maine is a commoner, she is approachable. I don't mean to say that Miss Maine is not graceful. Comparing with Miss Christine, a trueborn noble, Miss Maine is not dignified enough.\n\n\n \"The Head Priest asks Miss Maine to take Rosina as attendant, because he wants Miss Maine to acquire artistic cultivation. Since there is no blue-robed priestess in the temple as the role model, the best model is Rosina who followed Miss Christine as a close friend and got educated. As Rosina tries her best to overcome her weakness, I think Miss Maine will work hard to acquire artistic cultivation, right?\"\n\n\n Emm… Miss Maine is at a loss for words, and her embarrassed eyes are wandering. However, intrinsically, people of the top rank should not look bewildered.\n\n\n \"Miss Maine, when the attendants were gathered for the meeting, did Rosina avoid eye contact? Did she sob for lack of company?\"\n\n\n \"… Or did she face up, and stick to her own opinion?\"\n\n\n Miss Maine tilts her head to one side, as if wanting to say that she cannot understand. Children's behavior looks lovely, but a master should not act like this.\n\n\n \"That's the right way that the nobles deal with a problem. … Rosina came to my room and cried. She had well controlled her feeling till then.\"\n\n\n \"… Do I have to behave like Rosina?\"\n\n\n Miss Maine looks up at my face, biting her lip. Her eyes are as resolved as Rosina's.\n\n\n \"Since even the gray-robed priestesses of the orphanage can learn their mode of behavior, I don't think it will be a problem for Miss Maine. Please learn the mode of behavior from Rosina.\"\n\n\n \"… Alright.\""

    "content": " \n\n\n\n As an attendant, Rosina starts to work on her weak points: calculation and paperwork. Delia, who does the rough work alone, purses her lips discontentedly. But Rosina is almost an adult and can read and write, and thus she can relieve Fran of some of his work. So Delia does not complain about her.\n\n\n I know Delia is happy for her time of playing Fespiel is guaranteed. I also notice the fascinated look on her face when she is gazing at the Fespiel. \"How about asking her to teach you?\" I said to Delia. \"No! Geeze!\" She snarls though, I know she must have no time.\n\n\n Besides, as Wilma told me, I pay attention to correct my behavior carefully while learning from Rosina.\n\n\n However, every of my actions is different from hers. Rosina has a deliberate manner, and even walks at a light and elegant pace like she was dancing. She does not move fast, but is always unhurried like floating clouds and flowing water. It's an unbelievable pace.\n\n\n Even her ways of tilting her head and holding a pen, the lower hem of her clothes… each and every detail of her move is elegant. However, it makes people feel utterly natural, not haphazard at all.\n\n\n \"Is Rosina's deportment acquired by learning?\"\n\n\n \"Calculation is more difficult than deportment. How did Miss Maine acquire the ability of calculation? Could you please tell me?\"\n\n\n She looks at me and grins. Only practice can overcome weaknesses.\n\n\n As Rosina admonishes us, Delia and I began to pay attention to our own behaviors. Because Delia's goal is to become a mistress, I find her learning faster than me.\n\n\n This day, I receive the invitation from the Head Priest for lunch. The appointed time is 10 days later. The invitation says \"Please take the musical instrument with you. I want to know how your Fespiel training goes on.\" After the special training with Rosina, I complete the first task which the Head Priest imposed on me - to be able to play the Fespiel fluently within 3 days.\n\n\n … The goal and the deadline give me the actual feeling of growth.\n\n\n I present a suit of clothes for going out to Rosina, my Fespiel tutor, as the reward, and a pile of paper to Wilma, who have finished their cards, for her to sketch.\n\n\n \"Mr. Benno, when will you introduce me to the ink workshop?\"\n\n\n Because I want to make ink before winter comes. First, I want to visit the ink workshop before making the ink. On my way to the temple, I drop by the Gilberta Company and ask Mr. Benno. He shakes his head slightly.\n\n\n \"The ink workshop visit can be postponed. It's about the time to finish the restaurant. I want to talk with you about the interior decoration.\"\n\n\n I think he will bring me to the ink workshop. However, in some way, he brings up the topic of the Italian restaurant.\n\n\n \"How are things going on with the restaurant?\"\n\n\n \"The exterior engineering is completed. We will finish the interior work next. I need some advice on the tapestry and art decoration which copy the nobles' area of the temple. Please do bring along Fran.\"\n\n\n It seems that Mr. Benno wants to know Fran's advice, so I seem redundant. Because I know little about the interior decoration for the nobles, I have nothing to say.\n\n\n Thinking about this, I suddenly recall one person. Among my attendants, there is another one who may know the details about the work of art and interior decoration.\n\n\n \"… If you need some advice about the work of art, why not bring along Rosina? Though she is my new attendant, she was highly appreciated by a noble who likes art. She is a gray-robed priestess who behaves more noble-like than the lower-class nobles. I think she may have some advice from a female noble's perspective.\"\n\n\n Fran gets good educated from the Head Priest and knows how the nobles should behave. But he is a prim person, who has little flexibility. The Head Priest doesn't like futile endeavors and tends to the thought of \"the simpler, the better.\"\n\n\n On this point, Rosina is well educated by an art priestess, so she has a recreational instinct on anything. Besides, she has a good taste for arrangement of things and their presentation. Since Rosina comes, there are more flowers in our rooms. Things are not only stored in the cabinets, but are also displayed orderly.\n\n\n \"Well, that's good. Tomorrow afternoon, there will be a horse cart to the temple. So let's go to see the restaurant by it. Then Hugo will also go to the restaurant. The rest people should be in charge of tomorrow's meals.\"\n\n\n \"Ok.\"\n\n\n I'm disappointed for my request for visiting the ink workshop was unanswered. But it is a happy thing that the restaurant will be ready soon. \"I cannot wait for it.\" Lutz and I reply together. Then we decide to go to the temple and tell others the plan for tomorrow.\n\n\n \"Tomorrow afternoon, Mr. Benno will send a horse cart to catch me. He wants me to visit our restaurant. Will Fran and Rosina come with me?\"\n\n\n \"Ok,\" Fran and Rosina nod.\n\n\n \"Besides, Hugo will come together to see the kitchen. Please tell Hugo to go to the Gilberta Company and he need not work tomorrow. … How is the new cook?\"\n\n\n \"Because Ella is with him, there won't be any problem for him to carry out his work.\"\n\n\n Fran goes to inform Hugo and others. The new cook looks nervous, but he will make it. Because Hugo once worked with Ella to be in charge of cooking and they did everything very well, I think there will be no problem this time.\n\n\n The next day, after lunch, Fran and Rosina get dressed. I take off the blue robe with the help of Delia, and put on a noble-like blouse with broad cuff. Because Hugo will go to the restaurant as well, it's necessary to wear formally and behave gracefully.\n\n\n \"I want to go there too, geeze! I don't want to stay alone at home.\"\n\n\n \"Excuse me, Delia. We need Rosina's advice this time.\"\n\n\n I meet the piteous look of Delia, who is helping me prepare the visit. I don't know how much information the Temple Chief has learnt, I just cannot bring along Delia indeed.\n\n\n Besides, I leave Delia alone at home because she doesn't want to go to the orphanage and would rather improve herself alone than go to the forest. She seems to have forgotten that completely.\n\n\n \"Do I need to give Delia a reward for staying at home and doing the housework?\"\n\n\n After speaking with Delia, I get on the horse cart sent by Mr. Benno with Fran and Rosina.\n\n\n Fran is in light brown as usual. Rosina wears a moss green one-piece and a dark green bodice embroidered with geometric patterns. It fits her fluffy chestnut hair so well that she looks like a girl of noble birth.\n\n\n When Rosina served Miss Christine, she only wore the gray-robed priest's clothes when going to the temple. When I praise Rosina, she tugs at the train of her skirt blushingly and says, \"I'm over praised.\"\n\n\n … Her shyness gives me a gentlewomanly impression. It's lovely, but I doubt if I can imitate that manner. No, I don't think I can.\n\n\n Inside the horse cart, I introduce the Italian restaurant to Rosina and tell her the work today.\n\n\n \"We are going to create an atmosphere of the nobles' cafeteria in the Italian restaurant. Because I consider the guests to be the rich class like the bosses of those big retail stores. So I want to pay more attention to its interior decoration. As I suppose that the nobles will come for dinner, I need Fran and Rosina's advice.\"\n\n\n \"… May I take it as preparing Miss Christine's room?\"\n\n\n I nod at Rosina. I also ask Fran to give advice as if he is preparing the rooms of the Head Priest or the Temple Chief.\n\n\n \"So, we will tell our opinions. I hope Miss Maine do not speak too much. Because Hugo will be here, please express your opinion through us.\"\n\n\n \"… Alright.\"\n\n\n Since I have the business relationship with Mr. Benno, somehow we get familiar with each other. So, I always talk a lot. I must have what I want to say today noted on my tablet.\n\n\n … I don't want to be a well-off girl. I cannot even talk freely…\n\n\n When the horse cart approaches the exterior-completed restaurant, Lutz is waiting outside. Today I pretend to be a noble, while Lutz acts as a merchant apprentice who is ready to serve a noble responsively.\n\n\n \"I am glad to see you.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you for your hospitality.\"\n\n\n After finishing the farce-like greeting with Lutz, I follow him in. We restrain ourselves from laughing at each other's stage face.\n\n\n When we enter the big decorative wooden door, we can see a small hall like the one of the first floor of my house.\n\n\n \"This is the lounge for ushers and check-out. The left area is the kitchen, and the right one is the dining hall.\"\n\n\n As Lutz is speaking, he points at right. The door may be installed later. Then we see the white wall with holes at the four corners. Mr. Benno is inside the cafeteria.\n\n\n \"Miss Maine, I am glad to see you. This is the dining hall of our restaurant.\"\n\n\n Mr. Benno also uses the formal words for greeting.\n\n\n Mr. Benno says the interior is decorated according to my room, because it's the first accessible room as a model.\n\n\n \"… It's out of taste.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, the retaining walls will be built. But the carved retaining walls have not been delivered yet.\"\n\n\n Because I'm limited in speaking, I can only note \"delivery time of the retaining wall\" on the writing board.\n\n\n \"Things like retaining walls and decorative shelves have been decided, but the art objects to be displayed on the shelves have not been decided yet. We have chosen some tapestry, pictures, sculptures and plants. How and where should we display them? I wish to hear your opinion.\"\n\n\n While Mr. Benno is saying so, Fran's gaze focuses on Fran and Rosina.\n\n\n \"What kind of decorative shelf will be placed here?\"\n\n\n \"It will be different according to the size, width or color,\" Mr. Benno answers.\n\n\n He is a merchant who often deals with the nobles and knows their latest fashion elements. However, as expected, the art objects, decorations and art taste are entirely Rosina's things.\n\n\n Besides, Fran submits an alternative plan of Rosina's for lower cost. Thus, we cut those unnecessary and over-luxurious items."

An onlooker may not tell who is attendant.\n\n\n \"Miss Maine, is there anything you think necessary for interior decoration?\"\n\n\n \"… Right. I think it's nice to place a bookshelf in a corner of the room.\"\n\n\n Suddenly, Mr. Benno widens his eyes, as if saying \"Foolish! I oppose. How much do you want to pay?!\" But he restrains himself from saying it, just staring at me.\n\n\n \"Miss Maine, it really costs too much to place books for decoration.\"\n\n\n \"If it is placed in the dining hall, the books will smell of food.\n\n\n After the two attendants disprove my suggestion, I nod at them. I know it's impossible, but I really want a bookshelf, and want to state my opinion.\n\n\n Then, I keep quiet, and just listen to their talking.\n\n\n \"Since the restaurant will open in spring, maybe it's better to think more about carpet than tapestry. The nobles do have carpet in their room, to absorb noises.\"\n\n\n \"It's not easy to find the thick carpet on which carts can move freely, but it is worth every penny.\n\n\n The opinions not only from the perspective of nobles, but also of servers are given. Mr. Benno and I make notes of their opinions on the writing board.\n\n\n The conversation about the number of tables, the number of chairs, and the spare space goes on.\n\n\n \"Maybe that's all…\"\n\n\n \"If you want to create an atmosphere of noble dinner, why not use a napkin instead of a tablecloth?”\n\n\n Fran says.\n\n\n When I was still Urano Motosu, the tablecloths were not used for ornament, but were used to wipe hands or mouth, and sometimes even to blow the nose. Even it was a new one, the food stains could not be cleaned well enough if it was used several times, so it was not healthful and may be a source of diseases such as dysentery.\n\n\n \"What’s napkin?\"\n\n\n “Each customer can use it to wipe hands. You can see them as small pieces of the tablecloth. Recently, nobles begin to use napkins instead of tablecloths. Just for reference.\"\n\n\n According to Fran's words, I can feel my face shining brightly.\n\n\n \"Fran, that's great.\"\n\n\n \"Miss Maine?\"\n\n\n \"If we use a tablecloth, it would be easily stained. Then it does not look high-end at all. Make the size appropriate for an individual customer; thus even if it's stained it will be easier to be replaced by a new one. Cleanliness is important for a restaurant. Though there will be customers even if we use tablecloths. Let's get rid of the tablecloths and prepare the napkins.\"\n\n\n Mr. Benno strokes his chin as if thinking of something. Rosina pats me on the shoulder and gives me the tip to shut up.\n\n\n … Am I overexcited? But I really don't like the dirty tablecloth.\n\n\n Then, after the discussion on decoration of the dining hall is over, we enter the kitchen. It's made almost the same as that of my own house. I look around, and find it is a bit larger than mine.\n\n\n In the kitchen, Hugo is talking with Mark. They are talking about cooking utensils, ingredients and firewood. I tell Fran to ask if they have got any conclusion.\n\n\n “Basically, I will prepare the same tools as those used in Miss Maine's kitchen,” Hugo answers. Though I can hear it, Fran repeats it again and ask for my opinion.\n\n\n \"Cooking utensils are the same kind, so I don't think that there is any problem. But please consider the size and number before placing an order. If time is not enough for immediate washing, we'd better prepare multiple small cooking utensils.\"\n\n\n When I am speaking to Fran in a low voice, Hugo looks as if he is suddenly enlightened. Mark is making notes on the writing board that he made at some time.\n\n\n \"It's better to have three suppliers who can provide fresh cooking ingredients of high quality. A lot of firewood will be needed when we use the oven. We have to look for the suppliers of firewood not only nearby, but on other blocks, in order to guarantee the supply of firewood, as early as possible.\"\n\n\n After finishing the exchange of ideas in the kitchen, Mark and Hugo stay, and the rest of us get on the carriage to the Gilberta Company.\n\n\n We can talk in the Gilberta Company frankly.\n\n\n When we enter the company, I can throw away the disguise of the lady. Rosina frowns at my behavior. If I behave like a graceful lady when talking with Mr. Benno, I am not sure whether Mr. Benno will get my point or not. It's a bit troublesome.\n\n\n I open the writing board, and ask Mr. Benno about what I care about.\n\n\n \"Mr. Benno, I want to ask some questions. … You said that the delivery of the retaining wall is delayed. When will it be delivered? Is it necessary for the interior decoration? If the wall is not set, we can neither hang the pictures nor put the shelves, right?\"\n\n\n \"They say they are making it as fast as possible at the workshop, but will complete it after the winter. They are making not only the retaining wall, but also the door and window frame.\"\n\n\n Mr. Benno says it takes time. Something in his words bothers me.\n\n\n \"Hmm, perhaps, you trust this matter to only one workshop, right?\"\n\n\n \"… Usually we order goods from a special workshop.\"\n\n\n It's ok to trust a special workshop to finish complicated carvings. However, making the retaining wall, the door and the window frame is obviously a heavy workload for this shop.\n\n\n \"Then we have no other choice but to wait. Wouldn't it be better to order goods from different workshops? If you order all goods from one workshop only, when will the work be completed?\"\n\n\n \"But we have cooperated with the shop for so many years…\"\n\n\n \"You don't conclude an exclusive contract with the shop to build a restaurant, right? So there is no other problem. You can order the retaining wall from one workshop, the decorations on the inner door and the window frame from other one, the shelves or furniture from others. I don't think it will be completed if we don't do it in this way.\"\n\n\n However, according to Mr. Benno, it seems normal to take a lot of time to open a restaurant here. So far, the preparation done by the company is only buying the finished product, so it has not taken too much time. This is quite normal.\n\n\n \"I don't think it is bad to cooperate with multiple workshops. However, as it is common to work with one workshop, we just leave the business to Mr. Benno. … Only one thing. Do you think that any craftsman will finish the job if you specify the wood and design of the item in detail?\"\n\n\n \"… I will think about it.\"\n\n\n While Mr. Benno is writing something on the board, I glance at the next item.\n\n\n \"What about dishes? The nobles rarely use wooden tableware.\"\n\n\n \"… I supposed they should use pewter plates, so I ordered some. But this’s also going to take a long time. It's hard to get it in large amounts. The nobles do not share the same plate with others.\"\n\n\n In a cheap cafeteria, it is natural for customer to eat with their hands. Although less and less people eat in this way recently, and sharing of dishes is not uncommon. However, nobles are different.\"\n\n\n If we want to prepare the tableware for everyone, basically it is handmade. So it takes time. That's why I think it better to order from multiple workshops of different blocks.\n\n\n \"Can you order different tables from different workshops? Besides, we can choose different workshops according to different dishes at different prices…\"\n\n\n \"You are a little impatient.\"\n\n\n Ordering from several workshops at once is not welcomed here. I sigh lightly when Mr. Benno makes a sour face, and think about using workshops in different trades.\n\n\n \"So, how about some silverware and pottery, not just pewter?\"\n\n\n \"It's too expensive,\" Mr. Benno frowns and put on a long face.\n\n\n \"They will be used only for the upper-class customers, and make the customers have a sense of superiority. They can be decorations for daily use.\"\n\n\n \"… I see. What do you think?\" Benno looks at Fran and Rosina.\n\n\n \"Miss Maine's opinion sounds good. Nobles may arrange different plates for the invited guests of honor and other ordinary guests, but…\"\n\n\n According to Fran and Rosina, when the nobles go out for the dinner, they will bring their own cutlery and cup. Some are of high quality, and some are handed down from generation to generation. Because tableware is a kind of property. They say that some nobles often take their own dishes to prevent being poisoned.\n\n\n \"The commoners don't have such a habit.\"\n\n\n \"If they don't, why not copy the noble’s habits? After the preparation for the cafeteria is completed, we can write in the invitation for the first tasting to ask the guests to bring the cutlery and cup as it’s a noble habit. A millionaire may have his own proud tableware. And there may be someone who will buy some new ones in order to boast. Mr. Benno, do you have your satisfying tableware?”\n\n\n Hearing my words, Mr. Benno murmurs, \"… Yes, I do have some. Though it’s not good to flaunt, sometimes I just cannot control the comparing feeling. If people ask me to show it, I would be glad to bring it.\n\n\n \"Well then, how about bringing in the custom of the nobles? If the customers basically bring their cutlery with them, we won't need to prepare so many in our cafeteria. Neither do we have to worry our expensive tableware will be stolen by customers.\n\n\n Mr. Benno says that about decorating the restaurant into a noble one, what he worries most is theft, looting or destruction done by customers. Though I do not understand why the customers may steal things from a cafeteria, but it seems usual here.\n\n\n \"Well, for that matter… …you said that you had come up with a plan to prevent theft and hehaviors of reneging on the bill before, right? Please tell me some details.\"\n\n\n I answer with complete confidence.\n\n\n \"That's right. The plan is ‘no strangers allowed’.\"\n\n\n \"What's that?\""

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"… Introduction or recommendation is quite normal, right?\"\n\n\n As I briefly explained about the “no strangers allowed”, Mr. Benno shrugs his shoulders lightly. In this class-oriented city, it is common that one isn’t allowed to enter a restaurant because he does not have appropriate clothing or comes without introduction.\n\n\n \"Even for a guest who is introduced by someone, his payment and behavior are not necessarily good. Big spenders are not always good guests. It will be an annoyance if one is arrogant and overbearing just because he spends a lot of money.\"\n\n\n Mr. Benno scratches his head, for some guests are troublesome indeed. I make a brief explanation on the difference between introduced guests and strange guests.\n\n\n \"It's different from a usual introduction. For example, if a guest is introduced to you by someone, then steals ornaments, causes a commotion after getting drunk, or refuses to pay the bill, you can go to find the introducer and ask him to pay the bill or solve the problem.\"\n\n\n \"Then will the introducer have to pay?!\"\n\n\n With his eyes popping, Mr. Benno pounds on the table and jumps to his feet, looking down at me in surprise.\n\n\n \"Yes. If any trouble happens, it will not only be the problem of the restaurant or the guests. I think this may be effective to prevent trouble. Thus people would not introduce customers randomly. Obviously, it will do no good to the introducer himself. So people only introduce reliable customers to the restaurant.\"\n\n\n \"… However, won't it be a heavy burden for introducers?\"\n\n\n Sitting in the chair comfortably, Mr. Benno presses his temples slightly. He seems to be surprised by my idea. Because he needs not be responsible after he introduces a workshop to his customer.\n\n\n \"The atmosphere of the restaurant is very important. If we can ensure the delicious food and pleasing time for the guests, there will be more and more regular customers. …Well, I will leave it to Mr. Benno's judgment. To be clear, it's a matter I'm not familiar with.\"\n\n\n It is Benno's job to think or judge whether to adopt my opinion. They ask me about the questions, so I just present the solution I comes up with. I fail to become a merchant apprentice. So I'm not sure if the system I know is appropriate or not here.\n\n\n \"However, because the restaurant is newly opened, there is no regular customer. So I think it alright if we make the rules for such a high-end restaurant for nobles from the very beginning. But it’s impossible to make such rules half the way?\"\n\n\n Mr. Benno frowns and looks up into the sky.\n\n\n \"If we want more guests, we must consider every detail.\"\n\n\n \"Hmm … First, we have to decide what we don't compromise. Then we can change others according to the interior decoration of restaurant or its surroundings. Because the rules are adopted for the first time, it will be better to give the guests leeway, probably.\"\n\n\n \"Hmm …\"\n\n\n After knowing what Mr. Benno considers, I look at my tablet.\n\n\n \"Well, we have talked so much about the 'no strangers allowed'. Then think about the necessities for opening the restaurant.\"\n\n\n \"Necessities for opening the restaurant? Do you mean the interior decoration which has been decided?\"\n\n\n Mr. Benno narrows his eyes, looking puzzled. I look at the \"items\" listed on my tablet, and glare at Mr. Benno.\n\n\n \"What are you talking about? Yet we have only decided the interior decoration. We still have to prepare the menu and the bell on each table, right? We need high quality to make it luxurious.\"\n\n\n \"Menu? Waiters will tell the menu to guests.\"\n\n\n In this world, menu is showed by waiters orally. It won't be a problem in commoners' restaurants to tell guests the little difference; e.g., a sausage is toasted or boiled. Nor is there a problem in a noble family since the meal has been decided in advance and the server can just say \"Today's menu is this\".\n\n\n However, without a menu, it will be a heavy burden for waiters to ask guests to choose from multiple dishes of which they have not ever heard.\n\n\n If there is no menu, guests may not know what kind of food they are served, so they cannot choose what they want. It will also be more difficult to serve the guests.\n\n\n \"On the menu you can write the dishes that are cooked in the restaurant and the brands of drinks. Put one on each table, and then guests can order freely without asking waiters about the dishes one by one. I don't know to what extent it would relieve the burden of waiters, but it's better than nothing.\n\n\n \"Even if you make a menu, there must be someone who can't read.\"\n\n\n According to Mr. Benno's bitter expression, I recall the low literacy rate of the residents of this city. But it still not a problem. The guests coming to the Italian restaurant must be the rich people who earn enough money and are well educated. Even Lutz was required to learn letters when he became the merchant apprentice.\n\n\n \"If one cannot read the characters, usually he would ask a waiter. … But the first batch of guests coming to the tasting will be the bosses of large shops, right? So I think they can read the characters.\"\n\n\n \"… Well, yes.\"\n\n\n \"And because most of them are accompanied by their followers, there must be someone who can read.\"\n\n\n The bosses of big shops mainly talk about their work when they dine with their friends. So there must be followers who take documents or writing materials. If neither of them can read, they cannot discuss business. Nor can they understand what is written in the contrast, let alone the work.\n\n\n \"Ok, so here's a question about menu. I can pick out thicker paper to make menus, but do we need to add plants watermark like we did before? We'll prepare different menus for standard dishes and seasonal dishes. Besides, it will work as an advertisement for our plant paper.\"\n\n\n I want to make fashionable and delicate menus instead of cute ones. What kind of plant is better for the current season? How about making some colored paper?\n\n\n \"Will you use paper? Is it necessary for a menu?\"\n\n\n \"The menu is essential for the restaurant! Maine's Workshop can be in charge of making menus. My attendant’s handwriting is great. Haha.\"\n\n\n \"… I know nothing about it, neither its importance nor what we need. I'll leave it to you.\"\n\n\n Mr. Benno said tiredly, putting his hands on his forehead.\n\n\n I get a new job and begin to think of the design of the menu.\n\n\n \"Ok, no problem. Then, what do you think about the waiters? Our goal is creating noble-like atmosphere. So if we hire the commoners from this city, are they capable of serving the nobles?\n\n\n The waiters of the commoners' restaurants are quite different from those of the nobles'. I know this because I learnt it from the service of my first attendant Fran."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The waiters working in the commoners' restaurants are always careless since they need to offer a lot of food, and the soup is often spilt out. It will be a great trouble if they work together with Fran. Benno also knew it very well, and I saw him wearing a slightly helpless face.\n\n\n \"… Can you train them at your place?\"\n\n\n \"Do you mean that the waiters will be trained at my house? Well… the waiters cannot get permission, let alone the cooks…\"\n\n\n \"On the contrary, I mean how about getting the priests to work outside?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to have lunch with the Head Priest tomorrow and will ask him then. But don't anticipate too much.\"\n\n\n Once the Head Priest said, \"Orphans can only become priests or priestesses because there is no one who introduces or takes care of them.\" At that time, I thought his words meant \"They can go out if they have guardians.\" But if I had known the reality of the orphanage or the temple, I could not have thought so definitely.\n\n\n Now that there are so many idle priests, it may be good for them if they could make some money. But this might be considered to break the temple’s rules. It's a matter of some delicacy.\n\n\n \"Right. … I'm going to invite the Head Priest to the tasting. What do you think, Mr. Benno?\n\n\n \"… Wait a minute. Do you mean the Head Priest? He is a real noble. Are you sure he will come?\"\n\n\n It is usually impossible for the noble to come to a commoner's restaurant. Basically, they invite guests to their own house in the noble area.\n\n\n The temple is at the border of the nobles and the commoners, and there is a gate that leads to both. However, the blue-robed priests do not go to the Civilian Area except for rituals.\n\n\n Hmm, I think he is interested in the dishes and sweets I made. I think the way used by me to persuade him is important. It’s possible that he comes for the tasting.\"\n\n\n “… Well.”\n\n\n Mr. Benno rubs his chin, considering with great interest.\n\n\n \"So how about inviting some people who are only entrusted by Mr. Benno to the tasting? Do you feel special if you eat with a noble?\"\n\n\n \"…Indeed, I think so.\"\n\n\n \"If it really becomes a restaurant with guests of noble birth, the Italian restaurant will gain prestige, right?\"\n\n\n Mr. Benno's brown eyes are fixed on the profit, bright as a flesh eater's.\n\n\n \"Yes, it will.\"\n\n\n \"Unlike the pound cake tasting, I don't want to invite too many people at once. I'm going to invite only those who can be trusted in small groups. Besides, considering the number of cooks, it's impossible to prepare too much food. It's expensive, so there would not be too many potential customers. So let’s make it a restaurant for selected people only, and as luxurious as possible. What do you think?\"\n\n\n \"If you can get support from the Head Priest, it must be manageable. May you a success.\"\n\n\n We smile and shake hands with each other. Rosina turns to me gracefully.\n\n\n \"Excuse me, Miss Maine. What do you think about the music?\"\n\n\n \"Music?\"\n\n\n \"On a noble party, there will be several musicians who perform alternatively. But I'm not sure if there is a performance at the restaurant.\"\n\n\n … I have no idea about BGM.\n\n\n Then I look at Mr. Benno, who shrugs his shoulders lightly.\n\n\n \"Unfortunately, we cannot find a musician who can perform like those at the nobility's dinners.\"\n\n\n \"… What do you think, Rosina? Do you want to play in the restaurant?\"\n\n\n \"I have more time to play the musical instrument. So there is no problem.\"\n\n\n As long as I see Rosina's positive attitude, I can feel that she says so because she wants to play Fespiel.\n\n\n Is the restaurant mainly for lunch? If a customer makes a request when placing an order and is willing to pay an extra fee… I think Rosina can come to perform after the class.\n\n\n If there is a guest who pays the extra fee at lunch time and wants to listen to music, I will have my attendant Rosina come when the third bell rings. However, she has to learn the business. Besides, I have to report it to the Head Priest if she needs to go out every day.\n\n\n \"… Hey, can she play music at night?\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Some people may have a drink at night. A pretty girl like Rosina should not sit in front of a drunk guest. I oppose the idea definitely. If a musician is needed at dinner time, Mr. Benno needs to find someone else.\"\n\n\n Women who work in the bar at night often work as prostitutes meanwhile. It is likely that customers will not obey the rules, even though it's a luxury restaurant and it's different from other places. I don't want Rosina to work at the restaurant.\n\n\n While talking about the details, the sixth bell rings. It's time to end today's work. Mr. Benno summarizes various items discussed today, and then looks at me.\n\n\n \"If you go to the Head Priest's office tomorrow, try your best to invite him.\"\n\n\n \"No problem!\"\n\n\n \"… Well, I can't help worrying about it.\"\n\n\n I pout, seeing Mr. Benno pressing his belly.\n\n\n \"I cannot help but wonder when the work of restaurant will be completed.\"\n\n\n The next day I am invited to have lunch with the Head Priest.\n\n\n The last section of Fespiel practice is finished when the 3rd bell rings. Rosina guides me appraisingly, with a spirited look. Now I can manage to play Fespiel, without any mistake. I may fail to find the position of the strings when I am distracted by the lyrics. Perhaps I can perform well in front of Head Priest if I am careful enough.\n\n\n After the class, I help the Head Priest with his official business. Fran says that he goes to prepare for the luncheon, and leave Gil to go to the Head Priest's office with me. This is the first time I am invited like a noble. Because the other side is the Head Priest, I think I don’t need to be overcautious even if I cannot behave properly. But Fran and Rosina are extremely nervous.\n\n\n … Facing the nobles, the two are really a perfect pair.\n\n\n Rosina has helped a lot on how to get along with a noble at dinner. Fran cannot come along with me to everywhere, for he is a male. But Rosina can. She worked as an attendant of a noble lady.\n\n\n After the fourth bell rings, I finished the work and return to my room with Gil.\n\n\n After Delia helps me adjust my clothes, I set off with Rosina and Fran, who carry the big and small Fespiels separately. Besides, Fran carries a set of tableware.\n\n\n I am able to play the melodies learnt at class, but am so nervous that my hands shiver. However, Rosina is different. She keeps unperturbed when she is required to play Fespiel at dinner in the Head Priest's house.\n\n\n \"… Aren't you nervous, Rosina?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, I am. I feel very restless in my heart.\"\n\n\n She says while showing a soft smile which makes me rather doubt about her. But Rosina's wearing the same smile as the noble ladies’. Maybe it's a way to protect herself from being seen through by the opponents.\n\n\n \"You look not nervous at all… But do we have to pretend so?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, we have to smile and look quite capable.\"\n\n\n When we arrive at the Head Priest's house, we see several gray-robed priests are changing the arrangement of the furniture and preparing for the lunch. While noticing the Head Priest's attendants working efficiently, I give a noble greeting to the Head Priest for his invitation.\n\n\n I speak with a salutation taught by Fran, and the elegant manner taught by Rosina."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The greetings that Fran and Rosina prepared are so long. They begin with the names of the gods and goddesses and show how honored I am invited in a poetic way. I have to get down on my knees, cross my arms in front of my body, and keep my posture. In order to act elegantly, I have to suffer a lot because of the lack of strength.\n\n\n Lutz, who recite the greetings with me together, is also tired and says, \"It's bothersome. We just need to say 'Thank you very much for inviting me today.' That's enough.\"\n\n\n As Lutz is a Dapla of the Gilberta Company now, he will communicate with the nobles on business. So he also needs to remember those polite expressions. However, we are really tired of reciting the difficult words or the names of so many gods. I think that monotheism is good in this occasion.\n\n\n Now even I am facing the Head Priest, I can greet 1.5 times more gracefully than usual without slipping my mind. Finally, I step on the skirt of my costume and cannot adjust myself quickly, but have not fallen. I have grown up.\n\n\n \"Well, good. This part is well performed. Good job, both of you. … So, how is your Fespiel training?”\n\n\n The Head Priest praises the two instructors. When he looks at the Fespiel that Fran holds, a faint smile crosses his face.\n\n\n \"Because the teacher is good, you must have improved.\"\n\n\n \"I should take no credit. Because Miss Maine has talent for music! She remembers the scales very fast, and is good at distinguishing the sound. Her fingering is a little clumsy, but will be improved as long as she practices more.\"\n\n\n …No! There is no talent at all! I just remember the experience on the music class when I was still Urano Motosu!\n\n\n In my heart, I am so dismayed that I almost want to prostrate myself to beg for forgiveness. However, as Rosina told me a little while ago, I should smile for the time being. It makes me feel like being stuck, but I have to get used to it.\n\n\n \"Hmm, I'm looking forward to it. The meal is not ready yet, so show me how your practice goes on.\n\n\n On the Head Priest's words, a gray-robed priest holding a flute prepares a chair for me. Fran hands me the Fespiel, and encourages me, whispering, \"You can do it. It's ok.\"\n\n\n I can treat it as a practice. The melody is for beginners, so it is not difficult. There won't be any problem if I calm down.\n\n\n After taking a deep breath, I raise my face, and notice that Rosina's face is rigid as if she is too nervous. She looks like a mother who attends to an open house for the first time.\n\n\n I pluck the Fespiel’s strings. The first etude I learnt is \"Fruit in the Fall\". The lyrics are about the names of food and its good taste. So it is not difficult if only I don't make mistakes in fingering.\n\n\n \"Blessing of the forest, fruit in the autumn…\"\n\n\n Anyway, I play it without any mistake, and finally breathe a sigh of relief.\n\n\n \"… Well done.\"\n\n\n \"Miss Maine is really a quick learner. It's a great opportunity, so why don't you present the Head Priest the song you composed?\"\n\n\n \"What? … The song I composed?\"\n\n\n What does she mean? I can't remember it at all…\n\n\n \"Indeed… Like this melody…\"\n\n\n This Maine's ears are much keener at sound than Urano Motosu's. It may be because I kept practicing since I was young when I was Urano Motosu, or because this Maine's body has that talent, I'm not sure. I do not mean the absolute pitch hearing, but this body really has a good ear for music. Now it's easier to discern the musical scales of the melodies which I memorized when I was Urano Motosu.\n\n\n I tried to play the song that I had in my memory with Fespiel, but it seems that Rosina has memorized them well.\n\n\n \"Because I haven't written any lyrics yet… This time…\"\n\n\n Indeed, it is impossible to revise and sing the theme song of the English movie in the language of this world. I shake my head slowly and said so. The Head Priest wears a slight smile, with an interested look on his face.\n\n\n \"I look forward to it next time. Here is the following assignment.\"\n\n\n … What! I put myself into greater trouble again.\n\n\n My heart is crying when I receive the new musical score. Next time, in addition to the assignment, I have to show my own song.\n\n\n \"Then, this way please.\"\n\n\n The shining silver tableware is placed before the Head Priest. Fran has put the tableware which he brings along before me. It is normal here that the attendant brings the master's tableware. In order to prevent theft or damage, no one else can touch it.\n\n\n What I use at home is the tableware left by the former orphanage director, and it looks like good stuff. Fran had suggested that it would be better to buy some new one. But I didn't agree because it's too expensive to buy the tableware that matches the house. I said that \"I don't know the former head of the orphanage, but things did nothing guilty,\" and keep it for use.\n\n\n The noble meal is served in the order I know, and is similar to what I ate at the Guild Leader's house. Drinks are poured, followed by the appetizer, a soup, then the main dish, fruits, desserts, and after-meal tea.\n\n\n However, the quantity and the sorts are amazing. Probably because the remaining will be sent to the attendants. But there are eight different appetizers alone. The attendants keep serving little by little in the plate, but the appetizers are so many that I'm almost full.\n\n\n Fran knows how much I can eat, and picks only three kinds of appetizers that I like for me. While we are eating, I begin to consider how to improve the meals of our own restaurant.\n\n\n … Our food tastes good, but we have to make more efforts at the decoration, carving and display of the dishes. The nobles' dishes require quite a high level.\n\n\n But the soup here tastes just so so. My soup is better. There are several types of main dishes, and Fran gets as much as I can eat.\n\n\n Even at the Head Priest's house, there is no fish for the main dish, only meat. It seems that nobles here rarely eat fish.\n\n\n At dinner, we talk about the Fespiel training, questions on official business, the condition of orphanage and the condition of Maine's Workshop.\n\n\n The Head Priest only makes brief responses while listening. Sometimes he beats around the bush, but I cannot get his intention. I tilt my head to one side, and finish my talk when the Head Priest sighs tiredly.\n\n\n … If waiters in my restaurant can do as Fran does, there will be no problem. If possible, it would be better to have music performance.\n\n\n I have such a feeling when listening to Rosina's play of Fespiel at dinner. When I was still Urano Motosu, I had been to some restaurants with BGM. But I now find it not easy to listen to music in this world. At this moment, enjoying the music, I can feel my heart totally free.\n\n\n \"… You seem to be considering something. Is there anything helpful?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest asks me while we are drinking after-meal tea.\n\n\n \"Yes, it helps a lot. … Sir, I have a question.\"\n\n\n \"Wait a minute. Let's talk there.\"\n\n\n \"… Ok.\"\n\n\n Interrupted by the Head Priest, I drink up the fragrant tea at ease.\n\n\n The Head Priest shows me a secret chamber, and I follow him to get in. While the Head Priest prepares the chair, I clean the bench to have a place to sit.\n\n\n \"Well, then. What's your question?\"\n\n\n \"Could you please allow the idle gray-robed priests to work outside?\"\n\n\n Hearing my question, the Head Priest presses his temples and frowns."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"What do you mean working outside?\"\n\n\n \"… Work as a waiter to serve noble dishes at my restaurant.\"\n\n\n \"Oh,\" the Head Priest murmurs, as if he has remembered what we talked at my house before.\n\n\n \"To be a waiter, even a gray-robed priest must have the work experience of an attendant, right?\"\n\n\n \"A gray-robed priest who used to be an attendant is surely gentle and amiable, with modest bearing and is the most suitable person. Even Gil who has just become an attendant, can serve well to some extent. Others will be qualified for the work soon after a period of training.\"\n\n\n It would be helpful if there was one experienced person. But it is not a problem if a gray-robed priest has no attendant experience. The children of the orphanage are basically quiet and obedient, probably because they learn a lot from the attendants or the blue-robed priests, and are told not to be violent; or may because they grow up and are taught in this small orphanage from the time they were born.\n\n\n As they are close to the models, it is not difficult to teach them to behave like that.\n\n\n \"… If you want the waiters to improve their behavior soon, why not teach the commoners in the Civilian Area?\"\n\n\n \"There's a big difference in whether you know the noble family or not. They can judge a person according to his attitude, manner, wording, etc.\"\n\n\n If education is so easy, Mr. Benno will not worry. Most of the waitresses in the Civilian Area also serve as prostitutes. Besides, when the restaurant is busy, even cook apprentices are asked to come out for help. But it's basically considered as a low-level job.\n\n\n Even if we need to hire waitresses, most of the applicants must be women of humble birth. Then the exclusive atmosphere of the restaurant will be damaged. It's not easy to change their deportment and wording through education, just like what Lutz had suffered.\n\n\n \"People work in Mr. Benno's store shouldn’t be so bad. Don't you think his attendant is equal to the task?\"\n\n\n Mr. Benno's attendant, who the Head Priest knows, is Mark. Mark is by far the best one in the Gilberta Company. Because Mark is training the others, now the other attendants are all polite and good at wording and phrasing, but they won’t be allowed to do waiters' job.\n\n\n Daplas who have been contracted to Mr. Benno's store are basically the children of merchants who want to obtain cooperation with the Gilberta Company. They can do dressing-related work and paperwork, but being waiters is not their duty. Besides, if you let them do it, they will launch a backlash.\n\n\n \"A gray-robed priest who used to be an attendant can definitely do the job. But without a guardian, can we have them work outside? Then who will be their guardian? And if only gray-robed priests can go out and get salary, there will be disparities in the orphanage. What do you think of that?\"\n\n\n If there is only one person, Mr. Benno can be his guardian. But if several gray-robed priests go to do the waiter’s job, I don't know how to find guardians for everyone. Besides, I have never thought about the salary gap that may occur in the orphanage.\n\n\n \"… I have no answer now.\"\n\n\n \"It's not hard to imagine. It's not an easy problem.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest sighs slowly. It was not a simple question. But I know that I will not get his permission without the answer.\n\n\n \"I don't think I will get your permission right away today, but I just want to hear the idea of the Head Priest. … Sir, what do you think if the gray-robed priests go out for work?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest ponders on my question, tapping at his temples lightly with the fingertips, and narrowing his eyes.\n\n\n \"Hm. Yes. … I think it's difficult.\"\n\n\n \"Difficult?\"\n\n\n \"According to your behavior, I can see there is a big difference between the outside and the temple. Do you think the gray-robed priests who know only things inside the temple can easily find their feet in the outside world?\"\n\n\n I recall the first time when I walked outside with Fran and Gil, and shake my head slightly.\n\n\n \"If they only stay inside the restaurant, I think it may be somehow manageable. But if they go out of the restaurant…\"\n\n\n If the waiters just need to serve the guests in a restaurant with nobles' rooms, there should be any problem in the behavior of the gray-robed priests. Although they do business, according to gray-robed priests’ behavior in Maine's Workshop, I think it is all right.\n\n\n However, outside the restaurant, it's a world different from the temple.\n\n\n \"Besides, what will happen if a priest who knows the outside world by going out to work and wants to live that life? Can you guarantee their life outside the temple?\"\n\n\n \"I think it is difficult… I cannot be a guardian because I am not an adult. Even if I ask Mr. Benno for help, all he can offer is to let them live there like those apprentices. The priests, who have get used to receiving everything as the grace of God, will have difficulty living alone.\n\n\n They do the rough work for the temple, and then come back to have some food. In particular, because they earn some money by making kraft in Maine's Workshop, they have enough food and can be satisfied to some extent. If they live outside the temple, they will have to cook by themselves, or eat outside. However, since they have gotten accustomed to the shared noble food and the taste, I'm not sure whether they can endure other taste.\n\n\n Even if the meals are not a problem, it will still be a little troublesome for them to go out, because the priests have never bought anything in person, and do not know the concept or the usage of money.\n\n\n \"And then the most I concern is the public's attitude to the fact that I hire a gray-robed priest who used to be an orphan as the waiter. Will they accept it with pleasure? Maybe not, right?\"\n\n\n \"… I think it's difficult for them to accept it.\"\n\n\n I remember the reaction of my family members when I wanted to enter the temple. People's comments and image on the orphans and the temple were not good. I think they may make some good comments when they see them work as waiters; of course, someone may treat them with severe prejudice at the beginning.\n\n\n \"Furthermore, some may feel it difficult to stay in the orphanage due to the difference between those who work in the temple and those who go out for work, like the boy named Lutz who has friction with his family, for his job is different from his family’s.\"\n\n\n \"… Yes.\"\n\n\n If the job is different, the salary will be different. When the gap happens in the temple or the orphanage, where everyone calls for equality, it's not reasonable, and the situation will be worse than the friction in Lutz's house.\n\n\n And as I am the orphanage director, I have to resolve the trouble.\n\n\n … It's terrible.\n\n\n The confusion caused by the sudden change is completely unpredictable. Imagining that I should take all the responsibility, I want to escape.\n\n\n The gaze of the Head Priest is less sharp now, as if he has seen through my fear."

Merchants like Benno often get out of the temple, and go to the forest; I heard they have the chance to contact with the outside world, and are very happy. But in the temple, they just make a little contact with the outside world and do things according to the rules of the temple. It will be quite different if they really work outside the temple and act according to the rules there.\n\n\n \"That's right.\"\n\n\n I nod, and the Head Priest looks a little relieved for I can understand his analysis.\n\n\n \"Even if Benno can be a guardian, I still don't know him well. I don't know how to judge whether he is more reliable than those lower-class nobles who buy gray-robed priests for rough work. And I do not know whether a restaurant is an appropriate workplace for the priests, either.\"\n\n\n \"Well, if you come to the tasting, you will see the environment and draw a conclusion.\"\n\n\n When I suggest it to the Head Priest with a smile, he shrugs his shoulders dully and shakes his head.\n\n\n \"I don't know what your plan is, but I can read through your face that it's not a good one. I hope you can learn how to hide your emotions. … Anyway, I will allow the merchants to enter Maine's Workshop, and allow them to increase their work. But I must forbid the priests from working outside the temple.\n\n\n I have expected that my plan may be rejected, so I don’t feel so disappointed. I begin to think I just need to improve gradually, and maybe someday my advice will be accepted by the Head Priest.\n\n\n \"… I see. We still have some time to improve ourselves before we complete the restaurant. Mr. Benno can prove his personality to you by his hard work, Sir.\"\n\n\n \"Isn't it your hard work?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, it is. I will help with the restaurant’s matter to some extent, but meanwhile I have to work hard at a lot of other aspects.\"\n\n\n \"I see.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest smiles, \"The most important thing for you is to acquire noble behavior.\"\n\n\n … For me, the most important thing is to make a picture book for the baby.\n\n\n \"That's how the Head Priests rejected my proposal about letting gray-robed priests work outside.\"\n\n\n The day after I have the lunch with the Head Priest, I report the result to Mr. Benno at his store as usual. After talking about what I saw in the nobles' diet, I tell him that the Head Priest did not allow gray-robed priests to work outside.\n\n\n \"As expected,\" Mr. Benno also supposed so.\n\n\n \"Well, Maine. Because we are allowed to go to Maine's Workshop, why not open a waiter training center there?\"\n\n\n \"Hmm, maybe it's the right time for earning money during the winter when we can't make paper. But I plan to let them do handwork.\"\n\n\n Winter is a season when we need lots of firewood and food. We can't find them in the forest, so we have to buy them. We cannot go out because of the heavy snow, so we can do some handwork to kill time, and more importantly, to earn some money.\n\n\n \"What do you want children at the orphanage to do?\"\n\n\n \"We plan to make many toys. I would like to order a lot of planks from the woodwork workshop, but the workshop you know is busy with restaurant's interior decoration, right? Could you please introduce some other workshops?\"\n\n\n Besides, I wish Mr. Benno would think about the delay of the restaurant project. Although it is said to be normal here, I' cannot bear the fact that my plan is upset for it.\n\n\n \"Other workshop…\"\n\n\n \"Because this is related to preparation of the orphanage for the winter, the delivery date is important.\"\n\n\n Benno is reluctant to introduce other workshops. But to be honest, it's also a problem to have my work delayed. Indeed, I need a workshop that can deliver the goods in time.\n\n\n \"If it's so difficult for you to introduce me in terms of relationships, is it ok to ask someone else for help?\"\n\n\n \"You mean Frieda? No.\" Mr. Benno said with his eyes wide open.\n\n\n Of course, Frieda knows other workshops, just like Mr. Benno. But Mr. Benno rejects my proposal even before I speak out this name.\n\n\n \"… Well. Let me talk to the craftsman and ask him to introduce other workshops to you.\"\n\n\n \"Well, then, I'd like an ink workshop first. I also need ink. It would be meaningless if I have boards only, without any ink.\"\n\n\n Ink, ink… As I demand with greater vehemence, Mr. Benno stands up after scratching his head several times. He suddenly holds me up, and strides out of the room.\n\n\n “Mark, I will take Maine to the Ink Workshop and Woodwork Workshop. Lutz, come with us.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, master.\"\n\n\n I go to an ink store, being held by Benno.\n\n\n I check the price of the ink displayed on the shelf, and feel there is a long way to go before I can run a printing business for the over-high price of link.\n\n\n \"Are there any other inks?\"\n\n\n \"They are not for sale here. If you really concern with, go to the workshop directly.\"\n\n\n I droop my head. Mr. Benno asks the clerk about the location of ink workshop. This time we are heading towards the artisan street.\n\n\n When we get to the ink workshop of artisan street, a gust of miscellaneous smells rush towards us. Mr. Benno puts me down and I walk into the workshop myself.\n\n\n \"… A customer seldom comes here directly. Is there anything I can do for you?\"\n\n\n Only the wealthy people who can read and write need ink. So, they just order inks at shops, but not at the workshop. It seems that no customer comes to the workshop where the pungent smell like medicine’s is filling the air.\n\n\n The boss of the workshop in his union suit stained with black paint and oil looks me up and down, with a suspicious face. Extracting the pigment and blending the ink is a delicate task. He looks like a sensitive man.\n\n\n \"Excuse me. I want to know the types of ink made here.\"\n\n\n \"Types?\"\n\n\n Hearing my question, the boss stares at me with a deeper frown.\n\n\n \"Yes. How do you make it?\"\n\n\n \"I cannot tell our method to others, girl.\"\n\n\n The boss gives a snort. As he is about to finish the talk, I hurry to explain,\n\n\n \"I don't mean to know the method… I want to know the type of ink. Is it Gallnut ink? or Lamp Black? Do you make the one with high viscosity…? I want to know that.\"\n\n\n \"… Ha? What?\"\n\n\n Since I don't know the name of the ink type in this world, the boss doesn’t seem to understand me at all. I try desperately thinking all the words I know about the type of ink, in an effort to get the ink-related information from my memory.\n\n\n \"Hmm, how many types do you handle here?\"\n\n\n \"Ink is ink. There is only one type.\"\n\n\n The boss shrugs his shoulders, gesturing for me not to ask so childish a question.\n\n\n \"Well then, I have known the brief methods. So please tell us what kind of ink you make.\"\n\n\n \"Ahh.\"\n\n\n He closes eyes, looks annoyed and then nods slightly."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Assuming what he makes is gallnut ink, I begin to explain the process of making the gallnut ink to him as brief as possible.\n\n\n \"Extract the dye from the botanical node, ferment it, then mix it with ferrous ion… namely ferrite, and then about bark…\"\n\n\n \"That's it! How do you know that?\"\n\n\n The boss is surprised and changes his bothered attitude, leaning towards me and asking. He bends so much that I am forced one step back.\n\n\n \"There is no other type, right?\"\n\n\n \"… Is there any other ink?\"\n\n\n Judging from the reaction of the boss whose eyes suddenly narrow, I guess that only the gallnut ink is made here. I become disappointed, so I drop my shoulders and shake my head.\n\n\n “Well, don't mind. It's better to buy ink at a store than to order here, right?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, yes… Wait a minute! How do you know that?\"\n\n\n \"Anyway, I just remember what interests me.\"\n\n\n I say hiding behind Mr. Benno, and the boss sighs slightly. With arms folded over his chest, after thinking for a while, he moves one step backward.\n\n\n \"Girl, did you say there are other inks?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, I said so. Have I guessed right?\"\n\n\n When I raise my face a little and look up at the boss, he shakes his head with a bitter face.\n\n\n \"No. What is your name, girl?\"\n\n\n \"The Gilberta Company's Benno is her guardian. If you have any question, you can ask me. She has just asked so many questions. Sorry for troubling you.\"\n\n\n Covering my mouth to stop me from telling my name, Mr. Benno lifts me up and turns away.\n\n\n When I am lifted by Mr. Benno up to his shoulder, I am right face to face with the boss. He stares at me and says,\n\n\n \"… The Gilberta Company, right? Ok, I see.\"\n\n\n After leaving the ink workshop, we head to the woodwork workshop. On the way, I begin to receive Mr. Benno's sermon.\n\n\n \"You… What did you say just now?\"\n\n\n \"Huh? I just check the type of ink.\"\n\n\n \"Can you think it over before you say something somehow… Uh, you cannot, right.\"\n\n\n I don't intend to pick a quarrel, and think I just had a common talk with the boss. But from Mr. Benno's point of view, it doesn’t look like what I thought.\n\n\n However, since there is no other kind of ink, I cannot think out any other ways to ask my question. I don't think he would understand if I say Chinese ink or printing ink.\n\n\n \"When I heard he said there was only one type of ink, I guessed that he makes Gallnut ink only.\"\n\n\n Gallus ink is a commonly used ink in Europe. It has been widely used because of its simple production process, durability, and its high waterproofness. Unlike Chinese ink, it adheres firmly to parchment and cannot be erased by wiping or washing, which is an advantage of Gallnut ink.\n\n\n However, since the iron can be mixed and oxidized, the dried ink will be entangled with the fibers and corrode the paper’s surface. Plant paper is corroded faster than parchment, and years or decades later, there may be holes on the text part.\n\n\n So, if it is used for babies' books, that will be a problem for conservation. If I use the flame-retardant kraft, which stands up to the oxidation of iron, it costs so much that I have to give up.\n\n\n \"Is it better to make the ink by myself?\"\n\n\n If I write on plant paper, Chinese Ink may be better. For the Gallnut ink, it may be better to dilute the acidity and make it a bit neutral, but that may stick a knife into vested interests of the Gallnut ink-makers. It would be better to develop inks other than Gallnut ink.\n\n\n \"Ah? Do you mean to challenge the Ink Association squarely?\"\n\n\n \"Why do you look so excited? I'm not going to challenge the Ink Association.\"\n\n\n … Compared with aggressive Mr. Benno, I think I'm calm and amicable, right?\n\n\n \"I think if there are different inks, one can compare and buy the one he needs. But it's annoying since I have to make them. Basically, I don't like trouble.\"\n\n\n Hearing my objection, Mr. Benno snorts and starts walking. I begin to think about ink making alone while being shaken with the steps of Mr. Benno.\n\n\n \"I think that Chinese Ink is better for plant paper. But if I want to make engraving, I have to use an ink with high viscosity. Oh, wait a minute. There is an engraving of ancient China in the museum. So it must be somehow manageable to use Chinese ink for engraving. Or, how about trying an\"oil-based paint\"? Or\"mineral paint\"? Pictures drawn by crayons will become dirty if they are rubbed, so crayons are not suitable for engraving or picture books.\"\n\n\n When I was still Urano Motosu, I tried making ink, including Gallnut ink, oil paint and crayons with my mother, who once asked me\"Are you interested these?\" But each and every material was bought at stores. Now, it is difficult to get the equipment and materials here.\n\n\n … Crayon can be put in the case of lipstick or lip cream to solidify. The paint needs to be collected in a closed container, but what should I use here?\n\n\n \"Huh, Lutz. What is Maine saying?\"\n\n\n \"Because she just speaks out what she is thinking, so pay no attention to it. She can get the answer by herself in this way.\"\n\n\n \"… Really?\"\n\n\n Anyway, it's difficult to collect the paints. Just like when I make the charcoal pencil, it's necessary to collect the coal ash together.\n\n\n \"Hmm, but unlike before, now I can get glue and wax easily. So, the present conditions are quite different…\"\n\n\n Comparing with the time when I could not even afford a single nail, now the materials are easier to get. The degree of difficulty is indeed lower than before.\n\n\n \"Yeah, Lutz. It's the same as the paper-making; if I don't make a prototype, I can't show what I want exactly.\n\n\n I lean over Mr. Benno's shoulders and ask Lutz, Lutz shrugs at me subconsciously.\n\n\n \"… Have you decided? What kind of ink do you want to make?\"\n\n\n \"I try to make all kinds of ink for engraving. Because it has the best effect, I will make a picture book with it\".\n\n\n \"Let's work together,\" I say to Lutz, who heaves a deep sigh.\"Haven't you given up your idea of making the picture book yet?\"\n\n\n \"It's a gift for the baby from the sister. Can I give up?\"\n\n\n \"… Yes? Though things in Maine's Workshop have been on the right track, now we are getting busy again.\"\n\n\n Lutz says embarrassedly, but laughs as he finds it worthwhile."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n I have made up my mind to make ink, but I cannot do it at once. First of all, I have to go to Zeek's woodwork workshop and ask the boss to introduce me another workshop.\n\n\n When I arrive there, an assistant is working at the counter. I raise my face with an amiable smile.\n\n\n \"Hey, Mr. Benno, Zeek.\"\n\n\n \"Call the boss.\"\n\n\n Hearing Mr. Benno's word, the assistant immediately turns to the back room. After I hear a vaguely shout \"Boss!\" the boss comes out, wiping away the wood chips from his clothes. He is a heavy bearded man, whose right upper arm is very strong.\n\n\n \"Yeah, Mr. Benno. I'm sorry. The breast wall has not been finished yet.\"\n\n\n \"It's alright. I want you to introduce another woodwork workshop today.\"\n\n\n \"…What do you mean?\"\n\n\n The boss' eyes sharpen. Mr. Benno shrugs his shoulders while observing the change in his attitude.\n\n\n \"I don't mean that we will end the contract. Our order has been delayed. Besides, you are not be able to receive any other order now, right? Because of the consequence, how about separating parts of our jobs to other woodwork workshop? This girl wants her orders delivered.\"\n\n\n While Mr. Benno is speaking, he pushes me forward. The boss's expression loosens up and looks relieved. He stares at me up and down while he is stroking his beard.\n\n\n \"Hm. Well then, Go to Ingo's. Let's go.\"\n\n\n Then the boss takes us to the workshop of a person named Ingo. He goes together to introduce us directly in order to make them know exactly who we are. It seems that there are various interest relations between the workshops.\n\n\n Ingo seems to be a young boss who has recently opens his own workshop. Although he is young, he looks a little older than Mr. Benno. But considering that people who are called boss are usually over 40 years old, this boss belongs to the young generation of 30s indeed.\n\n\n \"I can't make it my business. Ingo, what do you think?\"\n\n\n \"That is to say, you have got a big job. Can I have a share?\"\n\n\n \"You've already got. Your customer is this little girl. Up to you now.\"\n\n\n The boss of Zeek goes back after saying so. The boss who was called Ingo looks down at me disappointedly. Though a bit muddy, but I look like a child who has not been baptized. So I have nothing to complain about.\n\n\n \"I need some board for handicrafts done in winter. So please do ensure the delivery date.\"\n\n\n I specify the size of the board and give the order.\n\n\n This winter, the handwork in the orphanage is to make reversi and playing cards. The reversible desk is a thick board, we can draw lines on it and mark the measure with ink, or cut the board into small pieces and apply ink on only one side. I'm glad that there is no problem in the game even it's not a circle as long as the size fits the measure.\n\n\n In addition, if we can make chess pieces, then the board can be used to play the chess. But the sculpture of chess pieces are too difficult to make. It is over difficulty for the “beginners' woodwork class” scheduled to be held at the orphanage. I want to use shogi pieces as substitute. We just need to write the names on each piece, so it's easy to make.\n\n\n Is there any difference between shogi and chess? No one knows. So it is better to decide the move and name of the pieces randomly. Yes, I am the rule.\n\n\n I also thought about making trump with paper, but the boards cost less than paper. Besides, Maine's Workshop only makes Japanese paper, which is not suitable for playing cards unless it is slightly modified or processed. If I use a thin board, it would be safe enough that even if children handle it a bit wildly.\n\n\n I don't need change the colors and marks, but I have to think about what to do with J, Q and K. It's too hard to draw the pictures.\n\n\n \"Besides, what on earth do you use so many boards for?\"\n\n\n I collect the guild cards and pay Ingo the advance money. Holding t the director's guild card of the workshop, Ingo's attitude gets a little casual as the credit gets improved as soon as the money is paid.\n\n\n \"Well, it is used for the handiwork done in winter. But the details are a secret. I hope we can take good use of it. If it sells well, next year I will come here, too.\"\n\n\n \"… Next year? Isn't it his order?\"\n\n\n Ingo points at the direction that the boss left.\n\n\n \"Mr. Benno's exclusive order is from the workshop there, but I have not decided on it yet. I will judge according to the quality of work and the credibility of the delivery date.\"\n\n\n \"Hey, yeah…\"\n\n\n \"Then, I'm waiting for the Gilberta Company' delivery. Thank you.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, thank you. Here are my best regards.\"\n\n\n Having finished the order of the board, I go back to the store with Mr. Benno.\n\n\n When I return to the store, Mr. Benno lets me sit at the table in the back room. I am going to discuss with Mr. Benno and Lutz about upcoming plans.\n\n\n \"Now, let's talk about the whole story.\"\n\n\n As Mr. Benno tapping the table, he stars at me with his sharp eyes, like an interrogation in a criminal drama.\n\n\n \"What do you mean? I did not do anything wrong. It's a false accusation. I'm innocent.\"\n\n\n \"What are you saying, stupid. Now have you decided everything that you are going to do? This is what we are talking about. What will you use that board for? What will you do with the ink? How do you make it? What else do you need? Tell us all.\"\n\n\n Lutz leans out from my side to calm Mr. Benno down. He frowns embarrassedly and suggests.\n\n\n \"This can be the complementary of the paper making at Maine's Workshop. But it will be hard without a plan. Is there anything you need to get from the forest this year?\"\n\n\n \"Huh… wait a minute. Let me see.\"\n\n\n I take out the tablet and write out what I want to make and what I need. I need plate and ink for making toys. As I am writing \"For making ink…,\" my mind becomes clear gradually.\n\n\n While I am thinking, Mr. Benno and Lutz have prepared boards and ink for taking notes, too.\n\n\n \"In winter, we are going to make handiwork of 'reversi', and 'shogi's pieces'. The things we need for these are boards and ink.\"\n\n\n While I am speaking, Mr. Benno frowns, tilting his head to the side.\n\n\n \"What on earth are the things you are listing now?\"\n\n\n \"They are a kind of toys like cards. Oh, but unlike the cards, adults can play them too.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?\"\n\n\n \"I think they are perfect for killing time next winter.\""

Poor people do handiwork to earn some small change. But what do the rich people do in winter?\n\n\n \"No matter what we make, ink is necessary. So I want to make it as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n \"You said that you want to make another ink at ink workshop, right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. If the ink is made through a method completely different from that of other workshops, we will not need permission to make it, nor will I be complained by others, right?\"\n\n\n If the method is kept secret, or made it in a workshop with the association's permission, there is a risk that it may get help up by contract magic. If I make it myself and violate anything, I may be penalized.\n\n\n Indeed. People do not know the method. Because it's new to here, you won't get held up by contract magic, nor do you need anyone's permission. You can just sneer, even if someone complains. But because you said something extra to the boss of ink workshop, some people have been gathering here for feeler or information…\"\n\n\n \"Ah? Did I say anything unnecessary?\"\n\n\n It's weird, because I just said very few necessary things for explanation. While I tilt my head to the side, I catch a sharp eye of Mr. Benno.\n\n\n \"You did not only tell him do you know how to make the ink he is making, but also said you know other inks. That's the extra thing you have done!\"\n\n\n \"Eh. But the current ink production method is specified to the certain ink type. As the information on new ink type, I think it is necessary for his mental preparedness. For me, if I can succeed, I will sell the method according to the rules of ink association and have it mass-produced. So what I said are not really extra things.\"\n\n\n Mr. Benno frowns and holds his temples. After shaking his head several times as if to say that he cannot understand, he stared at me with his sharp eyes.\n\n\n \"Wait a minute. Do you mean to sell the method to the ink association?\"\n\n\n \"Right. So, when Mr. Benno established the botanical paper association, was it pretty hard to get over the vested interests? Even now, Mr. Otto, who is still assisting you, is making efforts with a side job as a soldier, right? You have spread too thin to have enough employees, right? So it's impossible to establish a new association according to the method of making ink. If anyone wants to do it, then leave all the decision-making to him.\"\n\n\n The Botanical Paper Association was created without my knowing it, and they still have enough hands, so I give up my hope to take part in.\n\n\n However, I've heard from Lutz that in order to establish Botanical Paper Association and workshops in other cities, Mr. Benno asked his relatives for help, and that was a very tough thing to do. Even the Italian restaurant, which is opened to compete against Ilse, has made a foray into a non-specialized business. So Mark complained it was quite difficult. On top of this, I think it is reckless to establish a new ink association.\n\n\n \"… Sometimes I get a headache when I hear your opinion. What do you think of the benefits?\"\n\n\n \"But I'm not a merchant, I'm only a priestess apprentice right? If you make a few inks at Maine's Workshop, it won't attract too much attention. It's better for you to spread out the process method to make it in various places and lower the unit price.\n\n\n Lutz, who is listening to the conversation between Mr. Benno and me, sighs slightly. And the digressed topic returns to the main subject.\n\n\n \"Miss Maine, boss, how about discussing the ink business after the ink is completed? What do you need to make the ink?\"\n\n\n \"Well, I think of some things that are likely to be ink, like 'Chinese ink', 'oil-based paint', 'Gutenberg ink', 'Crayon'. But among them, only 'Crayon' is not suitable for engraving. For the time being, I'll make it later.\"\n\n\n \"As always, I cannot understand the explanation of Maine. So, what should I prepare?\"\n\n\n I look down at my tablet.\n\n\n \"Though the pigment is the material for making colors, the most easily obtained pigment for making black is soot. If we use soot as material, any ink will be black. So, let's collect it.\"\n\n\n To make the Chinese ink, we should mix soot, glue and perfume then knead them. To make oil-based paint, we should knead soot and dry oil. To make initial printing inks of high viscosity, which I call \"Gutenberg Ink\" for convenience, we should use boiled linseed oil and soot.\n\n\n \"I know that to make 'Chinese ink', we can use sesame oil, and soot extracted from rapeseed oil or extracted from pine soot. It's trial product this time, so I don't have to be too particular about it. For the time being, we can collect the soot when we clean up the furnace and chimney… We also did this last year, right?\"\n\n\n I recall the day when my mother wore a suite and cleaned the chimney in order to make a charcoal pencil. As a result, Lutz cleaned his house in order to get enough soot.\n\n\n \"Oh, that’s a great job. Besides, your mothers will also be very happy for you. It's good that we can collect all the materials, right?\"\n\n\n \"If that's the case, there is soot in my house. So come and clean it!\"\n\n\n Mr. Benno takes a shrewd ride. We have to clean the chimneys and furnaces before winter comes. It would be nice if we can collect enough materials.\n\n\n \"Will Mr. Benno pay the fees for cleaning the chimney?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, you get more soot easily, right?\"\n\n\n Mr. Benno smiles cunningly as if he is planning something. It’s nice if we could collect enough materials, though I do not know how much we would get.\n\n\n \"What will you do after you get the soot? What else do you need?\"\n\n\n \"Collecting soot\", Lutz writes on his tablet and looks at me. I look down at my tablet and confirm that the soot and glue are needed for making ink.\n\n\n \"The next is glue, right? Glue is a powerful paste. It can be taken from the skin and bone marrow of cattle, pigs or other animals. Besides, it is also used to knead the soot for making ink. I also used to stable the covers when I make books.\"\n\n\n \"Well, animal skin and bone marrow… It will be the time to prepare for the coming winter soon, if you process pork at orphanage, you we collect enough skin and bone marrow, righ?\"\n\n\n \"Hmm … Yeah.\"\n\n\n I remember one day I saw pigs were chopped and hung up in a rural area, I flinched for a moment. But now I'm used to it, I think that I can endure losing my mind or crying. However, I am too weak to chop the meat. So I almost lose my patient.\n\n\n \"Process pork at orphanage? Have you ever done this before?\"\n\n\n Mr. Benno tilts his head. I have tried to imagine that before.\n\n\n For children of the orphanage, the food they eat is always by God's grace, and they have even never seen the kalfe potatoes, let alone the experience of pork processing.\n\n\n \"No, never.\"\n\n\n \"If so, I will also prepare for the coming winter, so shall we order for the orphanage together?\"\n\n\n \"Thank you for your help! Thank you very much.\""

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Every year I had a fever and fainted because of it. So I had no chance to get involved in pork processing in my neighborhood, nor to work in the butcher's or the smokehouse. I put my hands together to thank Mr. Benno's advice.\n\n\n \"Can you get the glue if you have animal skin and bones?\"\n\n\n \"I know how to make it somehow, but I've never made glue. Because it has broad use, I want to make at all cost.\"\n\n\n To make the glue, we should soak animal skin, bones and the like in lime water to remove unnecessary things such as hair, and concentrate them by boiling till they are solidified, then dry them. The ingredient taken from the skin is more water resistant than the one from the bone.\n\n\n If possible, I want to make the glue that is distracted from the skin first.\n\n\n The main ingredient of glue is collagen, a sort of protein, so the ink made by an amateur will rot if it is stored too long. It is unexpectedly difficult to use because it is easy to rot in places where the temperature and humidity are high in hot summer days, and it hardens if the temperature is too low.\n\n\n \"So, you need to add some 'lime' into the 'glue'.\"\n\n\n \"What's that?\"\n\n\n \"Well, people use it when building a house. To make the white wall…\"\n\n\n \"Oh, is it lime?\"\n\n\n According to Lutz, I come up with the wording of lime here.\n\n\n Lime is also used in mortar. Lutz's father works in architectural industry, he must know where we can buy it.\n\n\n \"So, Lutz. Can you ask Uncle Deid where to buy lime?\"\n\n\n \"Ok, I see. … The lime. It looks like paper ash. Do you need only a little?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah.\"\n\n\n Now it's different from the first time when I made paper. This year, Lutz is able to write. And his parents have allowed him to be a merchant, so we can buy the materials with money. Last year, he had no money of his own, and could not get useful material with his parents' consent. Now his condition has changed a lot.\n\n\n While I am thinking, Lutz has noted down. He looks up at me.\n\n\n \"Is there anything else you need?\"\n\n\n \"Eh, for 'Chinese ink', soot and 'glue' are ok. For 'oil paint', we need 'linseed oil'. Maybe Mr. Benno know this?\"\n\n\n When I turn to Mr. Benno, Lutz also turns to him. Mr. Benno thinks while scratching his head, then he shakes his head slowly.\n\n\n \"… I've never heard about it. What's that?\"\n\n\n \"The cloths shop sells linen. Can we get hemp yarns there? 'Linseed oil' is simply extracted by squeezing hemp seeds. So I think it is sold anywhere.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, linseed oil? Ok, I see…But the oil is not so cheap, right?\"\n\n\n I respond to Mr. Benno's words with a vague smile. I have no choice even if it is not cheap.\n\n\n \"I have to buy it. I cannot cultivate hemp in order to get its seeds. Besides, there is no squeezer even if I buy the seeds. I would rather buy the linseed oil than to buy the machine to squeeze it. I will decide what we should do next year, after comparing the price of the seeds and the squeeze machine.\"\n\n\n \"I see.\"\n\n\n Meanwhile, some other drying oils come to my mind. But it is easier to get linseed oil than safflower oil or sunflower oil. Because it is used to make cloths at this place. Neither safflower nor sunflower has seen in this area.\n\n\n \"If we have enough raw materials, we can make the simplest sort of ink. Then let's think about the equipments. The best way is to mix the materials with a muller on a solid table such as marble.\"\n\n\n \"Are there any strange tools as you use when you made paper?\"\n\n\n I shake my head.\n\n\n \"No, I don't need so many tools. We can start if we have a plate, a muller, a sealed container for storage and a putty pallet, etc. If we ask the painting workshop, probably we can get the tools. My mother works at the dyeing workshop, so I will ask her, too.\"\n\n\n \"… I see. So let's prepare the materials and bring them to Maine's Workshop.\"\n\n\n As Mr. Benno ends the discussion, we start to go.\n\n\n To collect the soot, I have to clean the house. Thus both my mother and Aunt Carla will be pleased. So I try my best to clean the chimney. It's to kill two birds with a stone. As a result, I run a fever and fall in a faint. While I am unconscious on my bed, Lutz cleaned up Maine's Workshop and Mr. Benno's house, and have the soot collected.\n\n\n \"As you said, the quantity doubles without much trouble.\"\n\n\n Lutz reports to me when he comes for a visit.\n\n\n While Mr. Benno is talking to Colinna about how Lutz had cleaned the furnace and chimney for soot collecting, Otto has collected soot from her own house and given it to Lutz.\n\n\n \"Otto is a true love slave. You will definitely win Corinna.\"\n\n\n \"Besides, gray-robed priests all did their best.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?\"\n\n\n The gray-robed priests heard that Lutz was collecting the soot. Because they must clean the house for blue-robed priests before winter, they collected the soot from the blue priests' fireplaces, furnaces and every kitchen for me.\n\n\n It was Gil that cleaned the furnace and fireplace of my house.\n\n\n \"Because of that, a lot of soot has been gathered in Maine's Workshop.\"\n\n\n \"Really?\"\n\n\n \"My boss has bought linseed oil, and I also asked my father to buy the lime. I have also asked the painting workshop about the painting tools, and ordered the tools from the workshop that makes them. So the tools will be delivered soon.\"\n\n\n Thus, more and more materials and tools had been collected to the workshop while I was collapsed by the fever. Human-wave tactic is great.\n\n\n \"Now that we will prepare for the coming winter soon, let's make the glue later. First we should try to extract the oil for making ink. Then we will make the engraving and print it. Oh, I have to order the boards for engraving. But the ink is only the trial product, maybe I can use a stamp instead. Lutz, what do you think?\"\n\n\n \"… Maine, don't get so excited. First of all, if you don't bring the fever down, you cannot do anything, right?\"\n\n\n \"Awe…\"\n\n\n I'll start with oil painting tools after the fever goes down."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"Dad, please!\"\n\n\n \"What's up?\"\n\n\n The fever was not gone, and I lay on the bed with my hands folded, begging my father who brought me water. I wrote some mirrored letters on the cut surface of the wood that I could just hold and asked him to carve a seal.\n\n\n \"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, test the oily pigments.\"\n\n\n \"… Okay, but even if I'm done, I won't show you until you're healed.\"\n\n\n Two days later, I was finally able to get out of bed, but Lutz and my family began to discuss whether I could go out. Some people thought that if I went to the workshop today, I would be too excited, so it was better to observe my physical condition; some people thought that I would be excited to have a fever again anyway, it was better to let me go out.\n\n\n \"Um … I think …\"\n\n\n \"Don't talk! You will definitely say you want to go out!\"\n\n\n After Tuuli said, everyone agreed, so although I was the one who caused their discussion, I couldn't express my opinion. Boredom led me into the storeroom to rummage, and finally found a piece of thin wood. When everyone was discussing in the kitchen, I nestled in the corner, wrapped this wood with rags and bamboo leaves, so as not to scratch the paper.\n\n\n Great, baren was ready, and it should be useful for printmaking.\n\n\n When the baren was done, my family also came to the conclusionthat my physical condition still needed to be observed today, and I would be allowed to go to the temple tomorrow.\n\n\n Today I was full of energy! Bringing the seal my father made for me, soap, and old clothes that could be discarded directly after getting dirty, I was ready to go out.\n\n\n \"Lutz, I wish I can fly to the workshop!\"\n\n\n \"I'm sure you do so.\"\n\n\n Lutz also seemed to be looking forward to making something new. I don't know if it was an illusion, but his eyes seemed to be sparkling.\n\n\n \"Tell me what to do. You can't do it yourself, right? Can you explain it to me first?\"\n\n\n Since the blue-robed trainee priestess could not actually work in the workshop, I began explaining the steps to Lutz.\n\n\n \"Don't be anxious when making the pigments, you need to batch a small amount so that you can mix more evenly. First, pour the soot on the marble table, then make a groove in the center with your fingertips, drip a bit of linseed oil into it, and stir with a spatula. If the oil is not enough, just drip one drop at a time.When the soot is stirred well, keep grinding with a grinding rod.\"\n\n\n As I explained, I measured the amount of soot and oil by hands, but Lutz frowned.\n\n\n \"… you said to 'keep grinding', how long does it last?\"\n\n\n \"I'm not sure, it depends on the pigments. It took me twenty minutes before… well… it was about the same time as boiling the water in the soup pot. But people who grinded different pigments were not able to complete the work within this time. I think this is the difference.\"\n\n\n The pigments needed to be ground until it shone, ven those who are motivated and patient would feel tired. After I compared grinding time to cooking time, Lutz's eyes widened in surprise.\n\n\n \"… You really did it in the past?\"\n\n\n \"Because my previous strength was healthy and lively. People used to say that I was an energetic girl as long as I had a book. I even got the 'Library Attendance Award' because I went to the library every day.\"\n\n\n \"But now there is no trace of health.\"\n\n\n I nodded hard. I couldn't help feeling again, if this body was not so weak, I could do more.\n\n\n \"Then I'll go to the workshop first. Maine, take your time.\"\n\n\n Lutz handed me over to Fran at the entrance of the temple and walked to the workshop at a brisk pace. As I had been in bed for several days, I went first to the Dean's Office. After greeting the attendants, I intended to go to the workshop.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, I don't know what you're going to make, but you should practice fespiel before going to the workshop.\"\n\n\n I could not wait to rush to the workshop immediately but was stopped by Rogina with a gentle smile on her face. Finally got the permission to go out, my mind was all about making pigments, but now I encountered an unexpected ambush!\n\n\n \"But Rogina…\"\n\n\n \"For playing the fespiel, the most important thing is to practice every day. You have been resting for five days, in order to get the feel back, you should practice more than usual. Since you've had five days off, how about a fivefold increase in practice?\"\n\n\n With these words, Rogina's blue eyes lit up with delight.\n\n\n She was serious.\n\n\n Rogina really wanted to increase my practice amount fivefold.Just as I could enjoy reading books all day, Rogina was the kind of person who could survive with music.\n\n\n I shook my head in a hurry.\n\n\n \"No! Please let me practice as usual! I will try my best!\"\n\n\n \"So, let's begin.\"\n\n\n Rogina smiled and handed me the fespiel. I took it and started playing the first etude as a review. But as Rogina said, since I hadn't practice for five days, my fespiel skill, which was not great in the first place, had deteriorated further.\n\n\n Now I couldn't start practicing the second etude at all! I broke out in a cold sweat and practiced hard until the third bell.\n\n\n \"You were very focused in practice today.\"\n\n\n After the third bell rang, Rogina praised me with a smile. Being praised by a beauty was always a joy. OK, this time I must go to the workshop! I just came up with this idea, Fran appeared and I was stopped again.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, you have been ill for several days, so the official duties of the Head Priest are stagnant. Besides, he is worried about you. Let's go to him together.\"\n\n\n Fran apparently would not budge. I was absent for five days, the Head Priest would definitely worry about me, but I really wanted to go to the workshop. If only I could leave the Head Priest's official duties out of the clouds, I just wanted to make oily pigments.\n\n\n \"Ah… Fran…\"\n\n\n \"If you want to go to the workshop this afternoon, I will not stop you.\"\n\n\n \"Do your best, Master Maine, to learn not to be upset under such circumstances. Moreover, there are many things you have to do even if you are not good at or willing to do.\"\n\n\n In front of Rogina, who was not good at calculations, there were a stack of bills that Fran had ordered to be calculated before noon, so I could not refute her advice, but bowed my head in dismay. It's too difficult for me to smile in this circumstance. Although I thought so, I still suppressed my bad mood and forced a stiff smile.\n\n\n \"Rogina was right. I see. I'll go to the Head Priest's Office…\"\n\n\n I walked dejectedly to the Head Priest's Office. It's not that I hated to help the Head Priest with his official duties, but I was too eager to go to the workshop today.\n\n\n \"Ah, you finally recovered! Maine, come here.\"\n\n\n When the Head Priest saw me, he immediately handed over the magic tool to prevent eavesdropping. I held it in my palm and heard the voice of the Head Priest.\n\n\n \"The grey-robed priests of the orphanage were all dispatched a few days ago. They cleaned the stove and chimney earlier than in previous years. What are you up to?\"\n\n\n \"Please don't worry. I won't do anything out of line. I just want to make pigments suitable for writing on plant-made paper. They just helped me collect the soot, because that's what makes pigments.\"\n\n\n After listening to my reason, the Head Priest sighed with his hand against his forehead.\n\n\n \"I understand you're trying to make pigments. But be aware not to offend the Temple Chief by making too much noise.\"\n\n\n \"…Okay.\"\n\n\n I hadn't seen anyone recently, so I forgot it completely, but there was indeed a troublesome figure here, the Temple Chief. But it seemed that no matter what I do, he would feel offended. Was I the only one who felt so?\n\n\n After helping the Head Priest finish his official duties and lunch, I was finally able to head to the workshop. Lutz seemed to have expected that I would be stuck all morning, so he was directing everyone to make paper.\n\n\n \"You have been absent for five days, so you must have a lot of mess to clean up. You're so excited about making pigments, you just need these daily tasks to calm you down.\"\n\n\n \"… I am completely calm.\"\n\n\n Neatly placed in the workshop were the soot collected by everyone, the linseed oil purchased by Benno, the lime purchased by Lutz, and three sets of tools.\n\n\n \"I heard that everyone helped collect soot, thank you very much. Today I plan to make pigments, but this job requires strength. So, with the exception of the adult grey-robed priests, everyone else can concentrate on making paper as usual.\"\n\n\n After expressing thanks and assigning tasks, we started making oily pigments.\n\n\n \"Lutz, please.\"\n\n\n Lutz took the lead. He must have memorized the steps I explained. He poured the soot on the marble table, made a groove in the center with his fingertips, dripped a bit of oil into it, and then started to stir with a spatula. With the memory of making oily pigments, I didn't think I would fail. Just because the materials are not so particular, the quality of the pigments may not be very good."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"It looks like it's already well mixed, so let's start grinding.\"\n\n\n The materials can only be stirred evenly in small amounts, so I asked Lutz to start with a small amount. Everything looked smooth. If the materials were stirred, grinded them constantly with a grinding rod. Lutz's forehead was sweating and his face flushed. He was grinding with all his might. As a blue-robbed trainee priestess, I couldn't help. Besides, if I did, it would only hinder him, because it was physical work. And after all, this was too hard for a child, so I asked the gray-robed priests to stand by and be ready to take over Lutz's work, but Lutz did not ask for a break and finished it on his own.\n\n\n \"It is enough to grind until the pigments have such gloss and stickiness.\"\n\n\n I immediately took out the seal made by my father, pressed it a few times on the freshly made oily pigment, and then printed it on the poorly made paper. The word Maine appeared on the paper, and everyone amazed.\n\n\n \"… The oily pigment was really made.\"\n\n\n \"It can be made out of soot and oil…\"\n\n\n It was the first time that the gray-robed priests had seen the process, and they all stared at the oil pigment. It seemed that they had all doubted whether they could really make pigments out of soot and oil. I thought the painting workshop would have made the pigments in a similar way, but the priests wouldn't have had a chance to see it with their own eyes. Perhaps the way pigments were made was generally not disclosed.\n\n\n \"Well, others should try to make some, too. Please put the pigments in the clay pot.\"\n\n\n I asked Fran to bring a clay pot for oil pigments and let Lutz put the pigments in.\n\n\n \"Lutz, wash your hands and face with this soap and take a rest.\"\n\n\n A gray-robed priest took over Lutz's tools and started making pigments. Two others also brought another two sets of tools and started making together. While they were working hard, I prepared to test the freshly made oily pigment, such as dipping the tip of a wood-shaved pen into the pigment, then using this pen to write on paper or draw on a wooden board. If it was to be used as ordinary ink, the viscosity of this pigment was too high to write easily. However, if it was to be used for making prints, it was perfectly fine. If there was any problem, it was that without the roller that I used in the art class when I was Rena, the thickness of the pigments would be uneven. It's probably hard to make beautiful prints now. I really hoped there was a roller, at least a brush.\n\n\n \"Maine, how's the pigment tested?\"\n\n\n Lutz walked back after washing his face and hands. However, the black stains on his fingertips were not completely washed off. It seemed necessary to prepare soaps with stronger cleaning power.\n\n\n \"It's a success. Now I want to make other colors in the same way…\"\n\n\n \"Other colors? Can colors be made?\"\n\n\n Lutz looked surprised so I replied: \"As long as there are materials, the way is the same.\" Other colors could certainly be made, but I didn't know where and how to get the materials.\n\n\n \"Are there any other materials besides soot?\"\n\n\n \"As far as I know, the materials are mainly minerals. In simple terms, it is to grind stones of different colors into powder, mix the powder with oil and then grind like making the black pigment.\"\n\n\n Since the prehistoric era, loess and iron oxide had been used as dyes. Other famous ones include blue taken from lapis lazuli and azurite, and red taken from hematite and cinnabar. Another problem was that even if I saw the minerals in the rough state of this world, I probably wouldn't recognize them as minerals.\n\n\n \"… Hey, Maine, who is responsible for grinding the stones into powder? Won't it be me?\"\n\n\n Seeing Lutz's trepidation, I shook my head. The work of grinding stones into powder couldn't be left to Lutz, for his body couldn't bear it.\n\n\n \"Is anyone responsible for this kind of work? I asked my mother about the dyes used in the dyeing workshop, but she said that once more people want dyes, the price of dyes will increase. No one wants this to happen.\"\n\n\n When discussing dyes with my mother, she reminded me: \"When we set up a painting workshop before, we had conflicts over the materials used to make dyes. Maine, don't cause any disputes over this, or I won't be able to work in the workshop.\" I could never do anything that would cause my mother to lose her job.\n\n\n It's okay if we collected the materials from ourselves, but I'm afraid I could not buy pigments in the name of Maine Workshop. The trouble was, I didn't know where to get the minerals that could be used as materials. After all, my range of activities was only in the city and the forest next to it, which was of course given my physical condition.\n\n\n \"As long as you know the location, the easiest to get is the loess, right? Although it has to be ground into powder, the particles of the loess are already very small.\"\n\n\n \"So, who is responsible for grinding?\"\n\n\n Lutz's expression seemed to say, \"I will never do it!\" Now I had neither the tools nor the strength to grind the stone into powder, so I had to give up.\n\n\n \"You can take a look at the stone shop, maybe there will be stone fragments. However, it is too difficult to grind the stone into powder. Would you like to ask the staff of the painting workshop how to obtain the pigments?\"\n\n\n \"Master has said that although the tools are no problem, they refuse to provide information about the pigments.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, is it true?\"\n\n\n When discussing pigments with Lutz, the three gray-robed priests finished their work. They are adults and have the strength to complete faster than Lutz. I couldn't help but smile as I watched more and more pigments in the clay pot.\n\n\n \"Anyway, the seal has been successfully tested. We can talk about other colors later. Next, we will use woodblock prints to make picture books!\"\n\n\n \"Making pigments is too physically demanding. Let's call it a day. I've lost strength in my arms.\"\n\n\n \"Well. About papermaking, can you make more thick paper for picture books?\"\n\n\n \"Understood. Maine, go back to your room and take some rest. You can think about making picture books in bed. Got it?\"\n\n\n The oily pigments business was over for now, and the next step was to make picture books. I encouraged the children who were making paper in the workshop before leaving, and then returned to Dean's Office.\n\n\n Immediately after sitting down at the desk, I took out the paper sent by Benno and rewritten the Scripture into a story suitable for children. Since it was to be a picture book, the content did not need to be too detailed, and the wording should be as simple as possible. After writing it out, I checked it from the beginning. Although it seemed fine, I decided to ask the Head Priest whether such content could be made into a picture book.\n\n\n \"Ah, right. Since it's going to be a picture book, I should talk to Vilma about drawing… Rosina, can you accompany me to the orphanage? I have something to discuss with Vilma.\"\n\n\n When meeting Vilma who was not good at facing men, Rosina was a better companion than Fran. Rosina was sitting at the table under the guidance of Fran, learning to deal with affairs. Rosina, who was struggling with the wooden boards, smiled brightly when she heard my call. It seemed that calculations really pained her.\n\n\n \"Fran, Master Maine is calling me, I have to go out with her.\"\n\n\n Rosina quickly began to pack. Fran nodded and handed her some boards.\n\n\n \"Give these to Vilma. Although she doesn't seem to be good at calculations either, but now that she is in charge of the female dormitory, she should also learn.\"\n\n\n After taking the unfinished accounts and the files of the female dormitory, Rosina blinked and smiled softly.\n\n\n … She was indeed a lady who would never show a little bit of panic.\n\n\n With Rosina carrying the ink, paper and boards, we went to the orphanage together. During this time, the children were working in the workshop, so Vilma cleaned and cooked for them. She was like a mother to this orphanage family.\n\n\n \"Oh, Master Maine. Rosina is here too. Please sit down.\"\n\n\n Vilma greeted us with a tender smile, and I smiled back. I was lucky that all my attendants were beauties. After I sat down in the Dining room, Rosina explained to Vilma why we were here today.\n\n\n \"As previously announced, Master Maine would like you to paint pictures for a children's edition of the Scripture. In addition, these are the files Fran asked me to give you. He wants you to handle these matters as a female dormitory manager.\"\n\n\n Vilma's face paled as she looked at the boards piled like a hill. I heard that Vilma had once advised Rosina to overcome what she was not good at if she wanted to be an attendant of the temple.\n\n\n Then Rosina smiled and said: \"Vilma, take it easy. This is the job of an attendant, and even if you don't like it, practice makes perfect. As with the arts, practice and habit are the most important. Is that right, Master Maine?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. After getting used to it, you will make fewer mistakes and get faster. Let's overcome what we are not good at together.\"\n\n\n After giving the boards to Vilma, who bowed her head helplessly, I asked her and Rosina to read the story I had rewritten for the children and point out any irregularities or inappropriate deletions. Vilma suggested that I add all the words used on Carta to help children remember them better, so I racked my brain to rewrite the story again. During this period, Vilma began to draw pictures on boards about half the size of A5 as sketches for prints.\n\n\n \"Vilma, thank you so much. I'll ask someone to carve these pictures out and make them into a picture book. After checking the finished product, I'll decide whether to let you continue.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, I'd be happy to.\"\n\n\n I happily returned to the Dean's Office holding the sketched boards but found that Lutz was waiting for me angrily.\n\n\n \"Maine, didn't I tell you to stay in the room and rest?\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Didn't you tell me to figure out how to make picture books? … Did I hear you wrong?\"\n\n\n It seemed that I did mishear part of what was said. Lutz gave me a good scolding for not staying in the room."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n I wrote the contents of the picture book in mirrored letters on the sketched boards, and then asked Lutz to take them home and carve them into prints. Wilma's paintings are very detailed, so I was worried about whether Lutz could carve them well, but Lutz shrugged and said, \"Just say that this is Maine's commission and provide some compensation, Ralph and Seig will rush to do it.\"\n\n\n After entrusting Lutz and his two brothers to make prints, I also made a request to meet with the Head Priest, asking him to check the story I rewritten for the children, and then allowed me to make a picture book of the Scripture. Although I changed the content of the Scripture to make it easier for the children to understand, after all, the changes were made, and I thought I must get permission first.\n\n\n But every time I came up with a new idea, the Head Priest questioned me discreetly, so I followed him into the secret room again. In fact, I thought that a magic tool to prevent eavesdropping would be enough, but it seemed that the Head Priest could not judge whether what I had brought was suitable for others to see without first hearing my instructions.\n\n\n \"You mean the children's edition of the Scripture? That should help children improve their literacy.\"\n\n\n \"I plan to make a picture book and use it to teach orphans to read.\"\n\n\n \"Teaching orphans to read? why?\"\n\n\n Even if he asked me why, I did not really have a sound reason. I just wanted to start raising the literacy rate of ordinary people from those around me.\n\n\n \"Because sooner or later they will learn to read and write after they become attendants. Moreover, the main product that Maine Workshop intends to make is books. As employees of the workshop, how can they not read?\"\n\n\n \"Well, is that an idea from a businessman's perspective?\"\n\n\n After reading the story rewritten for the children, the Head Priest murmured, \"Well, okay.\" Then he looked at me silently, narrowing his sharp golden eyes.\n\n\n \"Maine, where did you get your education and what kind of education was it?\"\n\n\n This question from the Head Priest was too unprepared, and my smile froze on my face instantly.\n\n\n I really did not understand. What did I do wrong to have this question suddenly raised by the Head Priest? He still looked at me, watching my reaction, flicking his fingers against the paper on which the children's edition of the Scripture was written.\n\n\n \"…… The article is too organized. After reading such an ancient Scripture with long sentences and many difficult words, you can still get the point and rewrite it into a simple story that children can understand. It is definitely not an easy task. At least, it was impossible for someone who didn't even remember the words when I read the Scripture for her for the first time.\n\n\n My heart was shaking. In retrospect, this was the first time I have shown the article I wrote to the Head Priest. When helping with the paperwork, I was responsible for calculations, and every time I submitted a document, it was written under the guidance of Fran. The reason I learned to read and write was because I wanted to be a businessman's apprentice, but I was not clear about the vocabulary of daily life, so every time I wrote a letter, it had to be revised by Fran. It must be very unnatural for me, who was not good at writing, to write such an article.\n\n\n \"…Do you mean I write well?\"\n\n\n \"Well, it's well written. It's almost like it was written by a foreigner who had been fully educated in another language ??but doesn't understand the language here.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest looked at me with alertness, as if I were a spy. I clenched my lips. I really didn't know whether the Head Priest who could deduce this conclusion by just one article was too clever, or I was too stupid to notice that my writing was different from ordinary people.\n\n\n …… It should be both.\n\n\n I exhaled slowly and thought hard. Unlike Lutz, my trust in the Head Priest was not enough for me to tell him all the truth. Although his way of thinking was not the same as other blue-robed priests, it was because he was thinking from the perspective of the nobleman instead of the priest. What would someone with great power do to deal with an aberration like me? I could not imagine it.\n\n\n \"Head Priest, I was born and raised in this city. I have never gone out except to go to the forest. I never knew there were other countries until now.\"\n\n\n Maine did never leave the city. When she was younger, she rarely even stepped out of the house. Everyone knew she had absolutely no chance of receiving education. Hearing what I said, the Head Priest still seemed unable to dispel his doubts and kept his eyes fixed on me.\n\n\n \"The results of my investigation are also unquestionable… But it still doesn't make sense.\"\n\n\n So far, I had maintained a fairly good relationship with the Head Priest. Once he had doubts about me, there was no blue-robed priest in the temple willing to stand on my side. I could now carry out various activities smoothly without being hindered by other blue-robed priests, all thanks to his intermediary. To arouse his suspicions now would have deprived me of a backstop in the intricate society of the temple.\n\n\n … It's bad. Very bad.\n\n\n Although I must give an answer to him, lying is not an option. The Head Priest had a good memory. Unlike him, I did not have a brain good enough to remember what lies I had told forever, so I was bound to get caught somewhere. I had to muddle through as best I could without being a liar.\n\n\n \"… I was asked the same question when I provided a recipe for cooking. Why did I know this recipe and where did I see it?\"\n\n\n \"So, how did you answer?\"\n\n\n I looked back at the sharp eyes of the Head Priest and said,\n\n\n \"I told her that I saw it in my dreams. Not here, but in a dreamlike place where I can no longer go … If I answer like this, will you believe me?\"\n\n\n I didn't know how he'll react, but that's all I could say.\n\n\n I clenched my teeth and fists.\n\n\n …I answered, and I didn't lie.\n\n\n Cold sweat ran down my back. The Head Priest and me stared at each other silently. I felt that my internal organs were burning, but my skin was cold, which made me uncomfortable. Time was passing, and I had no idea how long it had elapsed.\n\n\n \"…I don't know.\"\n\n\n After a long time, the Head Priest said so with a sigh. He still frowned, but his eyes softened. I thought his eyes would get fiercer and he might yell at me, \"no kidding!\" \"Answer me honestly! \" Then I'd have the nerve to declare, \"I'm not lying.\" But his reaction was so unexpected that I didn't know what to do.\n\n\n \"Although your answer was ridiculous, it was not completely unreasonable, and it shows that I am correct in my guess that you were indeed educated elsewhere. What's more, you are not good at lying and concealing the truth, all your thoughts will show on your face. It is impossible for nobles to be deceived by you or to see what you are thinking. \"\n\n\n \"Woohoo …\"\n\n\n I couldn't help but cover my face, not wanting to be read any more. The Head Priest tapped his temple with his fingertips.\n\n\n \"But that's what makes it all the more confusing. I need time to think. You can go today.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest returned the children's edition of the Scripture to me, and I walked out of the secret room alone, but the gaze of the Head Priest stabbing on my back made me feel painful.\n\n\n The next day, I didn't go to the temple. This was because I had to prepare the tools needed for making prints, not because it was too awkward to meet the Head Priest. Definitely not!\n\n\n \"So, what exactly are you buying?\"\n\n\n \"I want to buy 'rollers' and brushes for printmaking.\"\n\n\n \"'Roller'? What is that?\"\n\n\n Lutz and Benno both had their heads tilted, so I had to explain to them as concisely as possible what the roller was.\n\n\n \" Uh… the roller is a cylinder with a curved handle, which can be rolled on a board.\"\n\n\n \"What are you saying?\"\n\n\n I struggled to explain, but they seemed completely lost, and at last they sighed heavily together. I thought the roller would be used in construction, so lutz would know, but it looked like there was no such thing at all.\n\n\n \"Anyway, let's go to the store first.\"\n\n\n Benno took me to the painting tool store, where he bought the grinding rods. So, I started looking for rollers and brushes here. I also explained to the boss what a roller was, but he didn't understand either. Although I found wide brushes, it's a pity that this store did not sell rollers.\n\n\n \"Hey, Maine, I didn't see the roller you said, what can I do now?\"\n\n\n \"Well, let's try it with a brush first. If it doesn't work, I will go to the forging workshop to make a custom order.\"\n\n\n \"It would be nice if someone could understand your instructions.\"\n\n\n Benno snorted a laugh, but I thought John of the forging workshop would know what I meant if I drew a sketch and detailed the measurements. I believed him!\n\n\n After buying things, Lutz and I went home together. As we walked hand in hand, I could feel the cool autumn wind blowing on us. As we sauntered toward home, Lutz suddenly said, \"I'm looking forward to tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"I was afraid you'd get too excited before you went shopping, so I kept it quiet. Actually, the prints you asked my brothers to make have already been finished. I'll go home and get it for you. \""

    "content": " \n\n\n\n I returned home and waited anxiously, and soon Lutz came with an engraved board. As soon as I saw the board handed by him, I knew it had been a complete failure.\n\n\n \"Maine, my brothers want me to tell you that this job requires high skills and is too difficult for them.\"\n\n\n \"…well, I probably knew it when I saw the board.\"\n\n\n Lutz looked ashamed as he took the message for his brothers. Probably because they did not grasp the force of the engraving, so the lines are either too convex or too deep. One reason was that they were not accustomed to making prints, the other reason was that Wilma's paintings were too detailed, which made the work more difficult. Even Ralph and Seig, who worked in the carpentry workshop, couldn't stand the job, it seemed that it was not easy to increase the number of pages of picture books by making prints.\n\n\n \"If you can print a good picture book with these prints, would you consider entrusting Mr. Inge's workshop for carving?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, let's entrust it to the real workshop. This job is too elaborate to earn pocket money.\"\n\n\n I nodded in agreement with lutz, but my heart sank at the thought of the rising cost of picture books.\n\n\n \"So, how to use the brush?\"\n\n\n Lutz quickly turned his attention to how to print picture books. He took the newly bought brush out of the bag and played with its tip. I took out the homemade baren and paper from my wooden box and started to explain.\n\n\n \"First lay paper underneath and place engraved board on it. Then apply the oily pigment lightly to the paper with the tip of the brush like this, making sure to brush evenly.\"\n\n\n I brushed back and forth on a board with a brush that had not been stained with any pigment to demonstrate Lutz, and he took notes while watching my demonstration.\n\n\n \"The roller is used in this step. Although I really want to spread the pigment evenly with a roller, it is not available right now, so I can only give up. After brushing the pigment, lightly place the paper on the board, and then press with baren, so that the pigment can be printed on the paper. Be sure to press all corners with the same force.\"\n\n\n I held baren and pressed in circles on the paper. \"I thought you'd made something strange again,\" Lutz whispered. \"I didn't expect it would really come in handy.\"\n\n\n \"After pressing, slowly tear off the paper, dry it and you are done.\"\n\n\n \"I know what to do. Let’s try it out tomorrow.\"\n\n\n The next day, I went to the temple with my heart in my mouth, but when I saw the Head Priest, he didn't say anything about my unusual behavior. He just gave me instructions as calmly as if nothing had happened. Until finally, the Head Priest did not question me a word, which made me feel relieved.\n\n\n Good. I got through the worst. Next is to make prints!\n\n\n \"Well, I'll take my leave today.\"\n\n\n All I could think of at the moment was prints, and the joy almost made me hum. As for the sight of the Head Priest that seemed to pierce me, I pretended not to feel it.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, you are in a good mood.\"\n\n\n \"Because I am done with the official duties, I’m going to the workshop to make picture books.\"\n\n\n When I answered Fran, I was already humming. When I came to Maine workshop after lunch, my mood was even better, a little too excited to say the least.\n\n\n \"Sorry to keep you waiting. So, let's start printing right away. Lutz, give it a try!\"\n\n\n When I arrived at the workshop, I saw that lutz was almost ready to make prints. Paper had been laid on the workbench with a board on it. The children were all around the bench in high spirits.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, what will these make?\"\n\n\n \" Well, please wait and see.\"\n\n\n As I made my way to the workbench, everyone backed away, leaving a special position with a great view. Because it was vacated for me, I stayed there to watch Lutz work. Lutz dipped the ink with a brush, then blackened the board, and the children let out squeals of excitement.\n\n\n \"Wow, it's all painted black! I can't see anything!\"\n\n\n For the squeals of the children, Lutz just raised his eyebrows and calmly went on with his work. He laid the paper down lightly on the inked board and pressed it with baren as I explained yesterday.\n\n\n \"Ah, it looks so fun. I also want to try it.\"\n\n\n \"Me too, me too!\"\n\n\n Lutz put baren down and pinched the edges of the paper with his fingers. With my excited gaze, Lutz tore the paper carefully and slowly. Under my expectant gaze, lutz tore the paper carefully and slowly. As I expected, the paper was printed with black pigment, just like the prints I was familiar with…\n\n\n \"Wow, it's a picture! It's black, but there are white lines on it!\"\n\n\n The children all beamed and chattered when Lutz conjured up a picture from a black board. After telling the children to go back to making paper, Lutz and I looked at the print.\n\n\n \"Maine, what do you think?\"\n\n\n \"… It seems weird.\"\n\n\n That was all I felt now, though I had been waiting excitedly for the paper to turn over. Unlike the prints made by Urano in primary school, this one was more delicate and full of artistic flavor. It seemed that it was indeed the right decision to entrust the engraving task to Ralph and Seig.\n\n\n \"As a print, in fact, it is a success. But this isn't for picture books, is it?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah. Although the words are understandable, the black background with white letters will make eyes uncomfortable.\"\n\n\n Not only did it hurt my eyes to read white letters on a black background, but I also made mistakes in some of them. This was my fault, but the picture and the letters were on the same board, if I wanted to change the characters, I had to change the picture together. Besides, it looked a bit ugly because there were so many places that were not well engraved. Although this was because Ralph and Seig were not used to engraving, if we use this board to make picture books, the children may not be able to adapt.\n\n\n \"Wouldn’t it be more clear if the letters were engraved on the seal?\"\n\n\n \"Ralph and Seig have said that the pattern this time is too complicated, how can we engrave all the letters on the seal? Relief requires a different amount of labor and time than ordinary engraving.\"\n\n\n \"That's right… It seems we have to think about other methods. At least it is certain that prints are not suitable for picture books. There are too many black parts on the print, making it look a bit scary.\"\n\n\n Lutz put the print on a shelf near the wall and began to pack his tools. After all, even I felt weird, there was no point in continuing.\n\n\n Hmm… the paintings of Wilma seemed to be more suitable for making etchings…\n\n\n However, even if I wanted to make etchings, I didn't know if I could easily buy corrosion fluid here. Also, the workshop was full of children, and I wanted to avoid dangerous chemicals.\n\n\n …But what should I do?\n\n\n In fact, I had never been frustrated by failure before, but this time I first asked Wilma to draw, and then asked Ralph and Seig to engrave, and it was really hard for me to tell them I’d failed. Besides, I couldn't ask them to continue to help me without being sure of the chances of success.\n\n\n \"What are you thinking?\"\n\n\n After finishing packing, Lutz walked back.\n\n\n \"I’m thinking of just not illustrating the children's edition of the Scripture. Anyway, even if there are no pictures, as long as there are words, it can also be called a book, right?\n\n\n \"I don't insist on illustrations, that's ok. But can a book without pictures be called a picture book?\"\n\n\n \"No. That's why I'm thinking about not making picture books, just general books.\"\n\n\n \"But didn't you say that the first picture book was the first gift you would give to your cute brother and sister?\"\n\n\n \"Ah! Yeah! How can I compromise! I must make a great picture book!\"\n\n\n …I can't be discouraged by one or two failures. Think of methods other than prints!"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Our first print was a complete failure. Although I came to the conclusion that prints were not suitable for picture books, I couldn't give up, so I did some soul-searching with Lutz on the way home.\n\n\n \"As the saying goes, failure is the mother of success. Find out the reason for your failure and you will have a chance to succeed next time.\"\n\n\n \"Well, Maine, what do you think is the reason for the failure?\"\n\n\n Hearing Lutz say this, I began to think about the reasons for my failure, and immediately came up with at least three.\n\n\n \"First of all, the sketches are too complicated. Wilma's paintings are too detailed to make prints.\"\n\n\n I could never ask Wilma to illustrate all picture books page by page, so I had to think of methods other than prints. It might be feasible to ask Wilma to change to something with simpler lines, but she had only seen the paintings in the temple. In this case, it would be very difficult for her to change her painting style. I must at least provide her with a model before I ask her to \"paint in this style\".\n\n\n \"By the way, I also made some mistakes in the mirrored letters. I need to check them more carefully in the future, but with a little care, I can avoid this kind of mistake, right? I should get someone else to check with me…\"\n\n\n \"Well… in that case, how about separating the words from the illustrations in the first place? That way, even if the words are wrong, the illustrations won't be affected.\"\n\n\n \"Lutz, you're a genius!”\n\n\n Since this picture book was for children who were first exposed to words, I always had a stereotype that words and illustrations should be put together, but in fact they could be divided into two pages.\n\n\n \"The last thing is the engraving. It's not very good in many places.\"\n\n\n In some places the letters were engraved through the board, and the lines of the illustration protruded. Lutz puffed out his cheeks in disgust when I pointed out the weakness of this part.\n\n\n \"It's partly because they don't have tools for engraving, not because they're bad at it.\"\n\n\n \"No tools… but your home is supposed to have a lot of tools because of work.\"\n\n\n The Lutz family had made a lot of room for tools, which should have come in all shapes and sizes. I thought back to Lutz’s house, but he gave me a slight shrug.\n\n\n \"Although we do have more large tools for processing wood than anyone else because of our work in architecture, we don't have tools for precision processing because we have no chance to use them.\"\n\n\n The tools uncle Dido used to repair houses were not suitable for precision processing. My father also had some large tools, but he only used a knife for small things.\n\n\n \"That painting is too delicate to engrave with a knife.\"\n\n\n \"What? Was that engraving made with a knife?\"\n\n\n If it was engraved with a knife, it could be said to be very excellent. Instead, I should have provided them with tools like the engraving knife when I commissioned the work.\n\n\n \"Then the next time I ask Ralph and Seig to engrave, I will also provide them with tools. Please say sorry and thank you for me.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I see… but why did it turn out to be a Scripture for children?\"\n\n\n Asked by Lutz, I began to wonder why I had gone from making a picture book for babies to making a Scripture for children.\n\n\n \"It seems that it is because the paintings Wilma can draw are basically related to the temple.\"\n\n\n \"Then if it's for the babies, it doesn't have to be a Scripture, does it?\"\n\n\n Because people said I was not good at drawing, I had to give the job to Wilma, and because all the paintings she could draw were related to the temple, I changed my mind to make the children's edition of the Scripture in order to cooperate with her.\n\n\n … Huh? Came to think of it, the children's edition of the Scripture wasn't a picture book for babies at all, was it?\n\n\n I finally sensed the seriousness of the situation. Picture books for babies had different needs than picture books for children. I couldn't confuse them because they were all young.\n\n\n \"Ok, let's make black and white picture book sfor the babies first. The children's edition of the Scripture can be made later!\"\n\n\n \"We only have white paper and black pigment, so we can only make black and white picture books, right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, but it's a little different.\"\n\n\n So let me go back to the beginning and think about what kind of picture book I want to make for babies. I began to recall lessons that referred to the theory of children's libraries and child services. First of all, it is said that babies at birth only have very blurred vision. Vision is inextricably linked to the development of the brain. By seeing a variety of things every day, the brain is slowly stimulated to grow. It takes three to four months after birth for a baby to recognize more prominent colors, such as red, and for the eyes to begin focusing.\n\n\n It is not until a baby is about a year old that he or she can see as well as an adult. Before that, the outlines of things were blurred in their eyes, and they had difficulty recognizing inconspicuous colors. So, picture books for babies under the age of one were all about strong contrast in color and sharp figures. Colors as long as white, black, and red were sufficient, while illustrations were best made up of clearly defined shapes such as circles, triangles, and squares.\n\n\n I recalled some of the black-and-white picture books for babies that were illustrated just by putting the graphics together. If such illustrations could be made into picture books, even I could draw them.\n\n\n \"Lutz, I'm not going to the temple tomorrow. I’ll stay home and make picture books for the babies!\"\n\n\n \"Okay, I will inform the temple. I will come to work with you tomorrow after I have checked Maine Workshop. Every time you make something, I must be there to watch you, otherwise it will be dangerous.\"\n\n\n Lutz started sighing again. I couldn't argue, so I changed the subject immediately.\n\n\n \"I want some thick paper. Can you bring me ten sheets of paper from the workshop?\"\n\n\n So the next day Lutz came to my house before the third bell.\n\n\n \"Wow, that's a mess. Aunt Eva will be angry.\"\n\n\n The table in the room was littered with notebooks, soot pencils, and boards. If my mother was at home, she would tell me to \"clean up quickly,\" but today she and Turi were away at work, so no one would lecture me.\n\n\n I kept drawing on the board, thinking about what would be the most appropriate illustration. When I had decided what to draw, I opened my notebook and drew it down with a soot pencil. My father had a ruler in his kit, so I took it out to draw straight lines. After drawing triangles and quadrangles, I should have drawn circles, but I suddenly stopped. I really wanted a compass.\n\n\n \"Lutz, do you have a compass in your house? It's a tool you can use to draw circles, and it looks something like this, and it's used like this way…\"\n\n\n I drew a circle on the board and made a circular motion with two fingers. Lutz nodded slightly.\n\n\n \"Oh, the compass? I used to have it, but now it seems to be missing.\"\n\n\n \"Well… I can't help it. I'll have to use something else instead.\"\n\n\n I got the thread and tied it to the soot pencil. I wanted a thumbtack, but I didn't have one, so I took a nail out of the tool box and wound the thread around it. Then I held the nail head with my left hand, straightened the thread, and turned the soot pencil to make a circle.\n\n\n \"Wow, that's amazing.\"\n\n\n It was probably the first time that Lutz had seen such a way of drawing circles, since it was not usually necessary to draw beautiful circles, and people who often drew circles at work used compasses. I was a little smug because I was rarely praised for it. I drew several circles in one go, but found the smaller ones not so easy to draw. In such a need to draw a lot of graphics, I particularly wanted the geometric graphic templates."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"Lutz, is there a shop here that sells geometric graphic templates?\"\n\n\n \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\n \"You see, you just dig out lots of patterns on thin metal plates or 'plastic', and they come in all sizes…\"\n\n\n \"You see, a geometric graphic template is a thin sheet of metal or 'plastic' with lots of hollow graphics, and the graphics come in all sizes…\"\n\n\n A geometric graphic template was handy when you need to draw the same graphic multiple times. Since this world had compasses, there may also be geometric graphic templates. I drew a diagram on the board, but Lutz just turned his head. He didn't seem to have seen anything like it.\n\n\n \"How does this work?\"\n\n\n \"Well, you can draw a line along the border like this to get the graphic you want.\"\n\n\n \"… can't you make it out of thick paper?\"\n\n\n \"Wow! Lutz, you're a genius!\"\n\n\n I pulled out a sheet of thick paper for my picture book and began to make a geometric graphic template. I drew various graphics of different sizes, and then, as long as I cut them down along the line, the geometric graphic template was done. Lutz and I worked together, happily drawing the graphics, but when it came to the cutting, I was struck by something important. We still didn't have a proper cutting tool!\n\n\n \"The graphics are too small to cut with a knife!\"\n\n\n I looked back and forth at the thick paper and the knives in our hands, and at last dropped my shoulders. Big circles and straight lines were just about manageable, but small circles were really impossible to cut.\n\n\n \"If we don't have a right tool, we'll go back to making prints. Let's ask John to make a penknife.\"\n\n\n \"What's that?\"\n\n\n \"It's a small, thin knife that I can use, too.\"\n\n\n Since we were going to commission work, we should go in formal dress, so Lutz and I changed into apprentice uniforms, took the guild certificate and detailed design, and went to the forge.\n\n\n Craftsman avenue was on the south side of the city, so John's forge was close to my house.\n\n\n \"Hello.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, welcome.\"\n\n\n They might have just been receiving guests, I saw several boards on the table in the doorway, and the master was sitting on a chair. At the sound of my greeting, he stroked his beard and turned to me with his eyes wide and bright. Last time I ordered an iron pen here, the master seemed to remember my face for that, so he grinned at me.\n\n\n \"Isn't this the little girl who came last time? Come to place an order again?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Is John here?\"\n\n\n \"He is. I'll get him. Please sit here and wait.\"\n\n\n The master folded the boards, picked them up, and shouted at the top of his voice, \"hey John! Your guests!\" Then we heard a thunk, and John, with his orange curls tied behind his head, rushed out in a panic.\n\n\n \"Yes… ah, you've been here before. You're from the Chilbota Chamber of Commerce, aren't you?\"\n\n\n \"Hello, John. I came today to ask you to make a penknife. Please look at the design.\"\n\n\n I took out the order written on the paper and flipped over to the back to show John the design. John felt the paper curiously and looked at my drawing, looking puzzled.\n\n\n \"Most people order big knives. No one has ever ordered a knife so small and so thin. What is it for?\"\n\n\n \"It's for cutting plant paper. When you cut small circles, the blade has to get smaller.\"\n\n\n \"Oh… to cut this paper? This is the first time I've touched plant paper.\"\n\n\n John picked up the paper with his fingertips, looked at it front and back several times, and waved it in front of his eyes to confirm its texture. After letting him confirm it to his heart's content, I pointed to the design on the back of the order. Since John's questions were very detailed, I wrote down the size and purpose of the knife on the order in advance.\n\n\n \"The handle can be made of wood, but I hope the blade can be replaced. You can try to leave a small hole in the blade. Also, there must be no gap between the handle and the body, otherwise the blade will wobble, which is very dangerous. The craft of this knife is very complicated, that's why I came to John who is good at fine craftsmanship.\"\n\n\n John looked at the design and asked questions about the replaceable blade. I gave him clear instructions as I answered. John's eyes lit up as if he was about to accept a challenge that ignited his spirit as a craftsman.\n\n\n \"Oh, that's interesting. It's nice to replace the blade so easily.\"\n\n\n \"In addition, please make a pen cap or a special box for the penknife. The blade is very sharp, so it is dangerous to leave it exposed, and it's also thin and small, which makes it easy to break or damage.\"\n\n\n \"That being the case, it is better to prepare more replaceable blades.\"\n\n\n After a long discussion, I produced the guild certificate and paid the master the deposit.\n\n\n \"When you're done, please send it to the Chilbota Chamber of Commerce.\"\n\n\n If this penknife came to my house, I couldn't get the cash ready right away. But if I asked John to send it to the Chamber of Commerce, as long as I told Benno and gave him the money in advance, he would pay John in cash when he received it. Also, I could trade with my guild certificate, which was convenient because I didn't have to carry cash around.\n\n\n \"Lutz, Maine!\"\n\n\n It was about ten days after I ordered the penknife. On the way home from the temple, Lutz and I passed the Chamber of Commerce and were stopped by the guard at the gate. It was Mark who told the guard that something was coming and let him call us in.\n\n\n \"John brought it in the afternoon. He was very excited and said it was an interesting job.\"\n\n\n I took the slim box Mark handed me and headed home. As soon as I got home, I used the penknife John had made and began to make the geometric graphic template. Since there was no special backing, I had to put thick paper on the board and be careful not to cut too hard, but this seemed to make the blade wear out faster. However, thanks to the sharp and handy penknife, the geometric graphic template was soon made. I put it on my notebook and blackened the hollow graphic with a soot pencil, creating a perfect black circle.\n\n\n \"As long as the template for the picture book is also made of thick paper, there's no need to engrave boards, is there? Wow, maybe I'm a genius, too.\"\n\n\n So I put it into practice and started to design black-and-white picture books using the geometric graphic template. I did it as I pleased: first, I made two large triangles, and then I added a rectangle to make a Japanese fir; Then a round eye, a semicircular mouth, and a triangular nose were drawn in a round frame to form the features of a man; And with the help of the compass, a flower composed of hexagons appeared.\n\n\n I couldn't help but enjoy it and plunged into the world of design picture books. I didn't cut the graphics with the penknife and complete the template until my family said, \"it's time to call it a day.\"\n\n\n \"Lutz, look! I'm done!\"\n\n\n The next day, I beamed as I showed Lutz the templates. After cutting the original thick paper in half, each template was about the size of A5. Lutz frowned and looked at me with a puzzled expression as he flipped through the ten templates.\n\n\n \"Hey, Maine, these pictures … will the baby really be happy after looking at them?\"\n\n\n \"Yes… yes! The contrast between black and white is very strong, and the pictures are also simple combinations of graphics, which has nothing to do with drawing skills, right? \"\n\n\n As I explained, Lutz's suspicious eyes became even more suspicious.\n\n\n \"Um… well, if you can take it yourself.\"\n\n\n So in the afternoon, though still full of doubt, Lutz started making picture books at the workshop. Like drawing with a geometric graphic template, he took a brush and filled the hollow graphics with pigment. As for the thinner lines, the paper would wrinkle if he used a brush to paint it, so I wrapped rags around a thin stick to make something like a cotton swab and asked him to apply the pigment with gentle pressure.\n\n\n \"Wow, great! It's done!\"\n\n\n \"… Master Maine, what is this?\"\n\n\n \"What's this for?\"\n\n\n The children gathered round and peered over. I asked a grey-robed priest to dry the pictures on the rack and answered the children's questions with a big smile.\n\n\n \"This is a picture book for the babies!\"\n\n\n \"… for the babies? Oh…\"\n\n\n The children's reactions were all indescribable. They either tilted their heads or looked away, and there was an air of \"I'd better not talk, though I can't understand it at all\".\n\n\n … Now I was sure everyone could not understand me. I wished the world would catch up with me soon.\n\n\n Although I felt a little lonely, the inside pages of the picture book were finished. I wanted the pages to spread out and stand up like screens, so I had to glue them to the boards, then drill holes in the boards and string them together.\n\n\n … Oh, and I had to make paste with gelatin!"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n No matter what people said, at least the inside pages of the black-and-white picture book for the babies were done. I felt satisfied, holding hands with Lutz as we walked home on the main road where the smell of autumn had grown stronger.\n\n\n \"We can't make gelatin until we're ready for the winter, so I want to continue making the children's edition of the Scripture.\"\n\n\n I wanted to finish this picture book of Scripture during the autumn of reading, so I told Lutz. He pondered for a moment.\n\n\n \"Do you want to make prints again? Cutting paper seems easier. Even you can do it.\"\n\n\n Lutz was right. It wasn't hard to cut thick paper into templates, and I could do it because it didn't take much effort.\n\n\n \"If the text in picture books is also cut to make templates, there would be no need to write mirrored letters. The number of words in picture books is also limited, so there should be time to finish…But it looks like we'll have to order some more penknives. Although the initial investment is large, it is necessary.\"\n\n\n Because it was specially made, the price of the penknife was on the high side, but if we wanted to make prints, we still had to prepare tools like engraving knives, so this was a necessary expense after all.\n\n\n \"We just saved for the initial investment anyway.\"\n\n\n I was very eager to develop movable type printing, but printing required a lot of movable type, and making them was a very delicate job. If I wanted to make movable type in metal, the cost would be even greater than now. I would have to wait a little longer before I got started on movable type printing.\n\n\n \"Alas, Mr. Gutenberg is still out of reach.\"\n\n\n \"Who is that?\"\n\n\n \"He is a great man who has accomplished an innovation, and in my mind he is god and my goal… but now I can only improve gradually within my own power. Lutz, do you think there is anything that needs to be improved?\"\n\n\n \"… do you have anything I can use to press the paper on when I print? Paper slides easily, and if I press it with my hand, I get ink on my fingers. You know it's hard to wash off, it bothers me.\"\n\n\n Lutz was an apprentice merchant who would receive nobles, and it would be very disgraceful for him to do so with hands as dirty as a craftsman's. Although I could get the grey-robed priests to do the printing, Lutz was obsessed with the idea that what Maine wanted must be made by him. Then I had to think of a way not to get his hands dirty.\n\n\n \"Well, it will be a lot better if we can make the frame for the stencil.\"\n\n\n \"Stencil? What's that again?\"\n\n\n \"There are many types of printing, one of which is stencil. Stencil requires wood frames to press the paper, so if you have a wood frame, you won't get your hands dirty. Um, it looks something like this.\"\n\n\n I took out my writing board, stopped where I was, and began to draw. Lutz was taken aback. He quickly pulled me to the side of the road and scolded me: \"Hey, Maine! At least get to the side first!\"\n\n\n \"We can install a wooden frame that can be lifted and lowered on a worktable the size of which can hold paper. The frame and the worktable are hinged, and a net is placed inside the frame. When printing, lower the frame to fix the paper and apply pigment through the net.\"\n\n\n \"I see… if the material is wood and net, is there any way to make it?\"\n\n\n With the exception of wax paper and steel plates, the other tools were not so complicated that even Lutz might be able to make them. The only tool we couldn't make ourselves was the wooden frame with a net.\n\n\n \"Lutz, can we place an order with the Artisan whom we had commissioned to make the bamboo curtains? Are the bamboo curtains for the plant paper workshop ready?\"\n\n\n \"You'll have to ask master and Mr. Mark about that.\"\n\n\n We happened to be near the Gilberta Company, so Lutz and I decided to go around. By the time we walked into the Company, everyone's work seemed to have come to an end. As I looked around the lobby, I saw that everyone's movements were quick but frantic.\n\n\n \"Ah, Maine, Lutz. If you need any help, go straight to the office.\"\n\n\n If we discuss things in the lobby, we would get in the way. Mark let us into the office without asking Benno. Benno, who was checking the accounts, sighed and accepted the meeting.\n\n\n \"Mr. Benno, may I take some of Mr. Mark's time tomorrow? I would like to ask him to accompany me to the artisan workshop and order something from the artisan who made the bamboo curtains before. Is that artisan free now?\"\n\n\n When I had finished, Benno turned over the ledger and nodded.\n\n\n \"He has delivered the goods as promised. He ought to be free, as long as there are no other orders. What are you going to order this time?\"\n\n\n \"A wooden frame with a net.\"\n\n\n At my answer, Benno turned to me with a quizzical look.\n\n\n \"What net? What is it for?\"\n\n\n \"With a net, Lutz doesn't get his hands dirty when he paints.\"\n\n\n Benno looked puzzled and turned to Lutz for his explanation. I had just explained this to Lutz, but he shook his head, indicating that he didn't know either.\n\n\n \"Oh, never mind. I'll tell Mark. When are you going?\"\n\n\n \"I have to go to the temple to practice fespiel. Is that OK in the afternoon?\"\n\n\n \"The afternoon is convenient for us, too. Come tomorrow, then.\"\n\n\n The next afternoon, Lutz and I went to the Gilberta Company after having lunch, and then accompanied by Mark, moved to the artisan workshop on Craftsman Avenue.\n\n\n \"… it's you again.\"\n\n\n When the artisan came out to meet us, he frowned and showed a very impatient expression. I couldn't help but think how he could give that look to his guests.\n\n\n \"You won't order bamboo curtains again, will you? I had a hard time getting the last batch done. Don't give me another job with such a tight deadline.\"\n\n\n It seemed that the work of making bamboo curtains had worn him out. I looked back and forth at the haggard artisan and gently smiling Mark, then quickly shook my head.\n\n\n \"Oh, no. This time I want to ask you to make a wooden frame.\"\n\n\n \"A wooden frame? You should go to the carpenter.\"\n\n\n The artisan's eyes turned to the door and waved his hand at us as if trying to drive us out.\n\n\n \"No, it's not just a wooden frame, I want to put a net on it… the net can be made of spun silk, can you make it? The mesh doesn't have to be very small, because the net is just used to hold the paper down so it doesn't slide or wrinkle.\"\n\n\n I took out the board and drew the frame I wanted the artisan to make. He squinted and stared at the picture for a long time, then sighed helplessly.\n\n\n \"… it is possible, but troublesome.\"\n\n\n \"Can I count on you?\"\n\n\n \"It takes time and effort, but you never hesitate to pay. Since it's a job other than making bamboo curtains, all right.\"\n\n\n So we ordered a wooden frame with a net and, as usual, asked the artisan to send it to the Gilberta Company when it was finished. Then at the end, Mark signed the contract.\n\n\n \"Mr Mark, I'd like to go somewhere else. Can we go round to the forge? I want to order some more penknives and talk to John about the rollers.\"\n\n\n If we wanted to make templates out of thick paper, we needed more penknives. In addition to myself and Lutz, I also wanted to prepare one for Wilma. Also, I wanted rollers that could spread the pigment evenly. But the rollers I used to know were made of rubber and sponge. Was there anything to replace them? Maybe cloth was one of the alternatives, but I didn't know if it worked.\n\n\n We went to the forge and ordered two more penknives. John accepted the commission with a big smile and seemed happy to have a job that would allow him to put his skills to good use.\n\n\n \"I also want to order some rollers…\"\n\n\n I drew a diagram of the roller for John. I also described to him what rubber and sponge were, but he just looked puzzled.\n\n\n \"… paint by rolling a cylinder? Another strange thing.\"\n\n\n \"I hope I won't feel bumps when I use the roller. I think it's possible to put a cloth around the surface of the cylinder to get the pigments on, and I'll leave it to John to decide which cloth to use.\"\n\n\n Although I wished to use a cloth that was slightly stretchy and easily stained with pigments, the rollers should work without it. After listening to my instructions, John nodded several times.\n\n\n \"If that's all it is, it shouldn't be hard to make. When it's done, shall I take it to the Gilberta Company as usual?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, please.\"\n\n\n When we left the forge, Lutz and I said goodbye to Mark and started toward home.\n\n\n \"The rest of the problem is the illustration. If we make a template out of thick paper and then print it, it will look like shadow puppetry. Now with the penknife, some fine lines can be preserved, but what should I do if I want Wilma to change her style a little?\"\n\n\n \"If you give her examples, she would know better how to draw. To be honest, no one can understand your vague explanations.\"\n\n\n Indeed, if it was something Wilma had not seen, however I tried to explain it, it would be difficult for her to understand at once.\n\n\n \"Hmm… I don't know if it's going to work, but I'll try to draw an example first.\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Do you want to do it yourself? Is it really all right?\"\n\n\n \"I will refer to Wilma's picture, don't worry. You are really disrespectful!\"\n\n\n Lutz's face twitched uneasily as he stared at me. I had only drew chibi picture once, how low is his evaluation of my skills?\n\n\n … Don't look down on me. Urano got a B in art almost every time.\n\n\n I said goodbye to Lutz in Well Square, who had looked worried until the end, and quickly returned home. As soon as I got home, I drew the outline of the goddess by referring to Wilma's print, and then painted black and white with soot pencil in imitation of the style of shadow puppetry. Although the pattern is simple, it seems clearer than the print.\n\n\n \"Um, it seems pretty good.\"\n\n\n But that's what I felt in the Japanese aesthetic, I didn't know if people here would accept that. The widely acclaimed drawings here were of a delicate and realistic style, so such drawings as shadow puppetry might be too simple to be accepted."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The next morning I put the failed print and my own drawing in my bag, intending to show them to Wilma. Of course, I didn't forget to take the penknife and soot pencil that I was going to give her.\n\n\n \"Good morning, Lutz. What do you think of such a picture?\"\n\n\n I took out the goddess picture I had drew yesterday and showed it to Lutz, who had come to pick me up. He had been looking uneasy, but when he saw the picture, he stared at it for a long time, then breathed in relief.\n\n\n \"Not bad. I think it looks more comfortable than print.\"\n\n\n \"Great, I'm going to ask Wilma if she can draw in this style.\"\n\n\n After the temple work, I was ready to leave for the orphanage. As Wilma was very afraid of men, I was accompanied by Rosina every time I went to see her.\n\n\n \"Welcome, Master Maine.\"\n\n\n I put the print on the table in the canteen and pushed it towards Wilma. Her expression darkened at the sight of it. This print must be different from what she imagined.\n\n\n \"Your drawing is very delicate, but making a print has to go through the engraving process, so this is the result. There is an amazing beauty in your drawing, but it can't be rendered as a print. So I'm wondering if you can draw the illustrations in a different way.\"\n\n\n As I spoke, I took out my own drawing. I had butterflies in my stomach about showing it to an expert, but that was the only way to proceed.\n\n\n \"I think it would be easier to print. I just don't know if it's acceptable. You're very good at drawing, so I'd like to ask your opinion…\"\n\n\n Wilma looked at my drawing and took a breath.\n\n\n \"… is this your work?\"\n\n\n \"I referred to your drawing when I drew this picture. With black and white, it looks something like this. What do you think? It's very different from normal drawings. Can you get the feeling?\"\n\n\n I watched Wilma's reaction. She stared at my drawing in silence for a while, then suddenly looked up, her brown eyes glowing with joy.\n\n\n \"I can draw in this way. I want to challenge myself to see how far I can go.\"\n\n\n \"Here is the penknife and the soot pencil for you. Draw and practice on the paper I gave you before. Also, this is the thick paper for picture books. When the first illustration is finished, we'll print it out to see how it looks.\"\n\n\n Wilma's eyes shone and she looked at my drawing with fascination. I gave her the tools and explained to her what to do when using them. She was an excellent artist, and she could certainly draw better than I could.\n\n\n Around the same time that Wilma was trying to draw in a new way, I started writing on thick paper to make templates. To my surprise, John soon brought the penknives and the rollers, so Lutz and I began to cut carefully with the penknives. It's a patient job, but I was happy to keep going when I thought about how these templates would turn into picture books.\n\n\n In addition, the net for Lutz was also completed. So I went to Lutz's house and asked Ralph and Seig to make a wooden worktable and frame for the stencil.\n\n\n \"What do you want?\"\n\n\n \"I just want a wooden frame! Lutz's hands won't get dirty with it. Please!\"\n\n\n I held up the detailed design in front of them. Because of their work, they often look at the design, so it didn't take them long to figure out how to make the wooden frame. As they discussed with me, they brought boards and nails.\n\n\n \"Hmm… is this all right?\"\n\n\n \"You are awesome! This is just right!\"\n\n\n They were worthy of the name of apprentice carpenter, the wooden frame had no deviation in size. It felt like they had finished it in the blink of an eye. Upon hearing my compliment, Ralph looked at Lutz and said with a chuckle, \"Lutz looks like a merchant now, so we need to look like carpenters.\"\n\n\n \"All right, carpenters, it's time for you to make a worktable.\"\n\n\n Lutz said, puffing his cheeks petulantly, Ralph and Seig shrugged with a smile and went back to work.\n\n\n \"Oh, not this one. Lutz, fetch that board over there.\"\n\n\n \"Make it smooth. This worktable is for you, isn't it? If there are any burrs left, you'll get hurt.\"\n\n\n \"I can't stand you any more. You are such good bosses.\"\n\n\n Luz was being bossed around as usual, but I could feel the old tension completely gone, and I secretly relieved.\n\n\n \"Seig, please install this, so you can fasten the net to the wooden frame.\"\n\n\n I asked Seig to install teardrop-shaped metal buckles on the wooden frame, which were used to secure the net to the wooden frame, as well as the board on the back of the frame. The next step was to connect the wooden frame with the worktable by hinges. Finally, I asked Ralph to install a board about 0.5 centimeters thick on the worktable so Lutz could line up the paper. At this point, the worktable was completed, taking less time than expected.\n\n\n \"… brothers, thank you. Er… you've been very helpful.\"\n\n\n Presumably embarrassed to thank his family, Lutz turned his head to the side. Ralph and Seig also looked away when they heard their little brother thank them.\n\n\n \"It's nothing.\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, yeah, just to earn some pocket money.\"\n\n\n If that was me, I would have jumped on Turi and given her a big hug to show my gratitude. But for the Lutz brothers, this kind of communication was probably the limit. But considering that they didn't even talk to each other before, I felt that they had made great progress, so I could not help looking at them with tender eyes. Their faces froze as they caught my eye.\n\n\n \"Maine, why do you keep looking at us!\"\n\n\n At this time they became one heart, they really were brothers. I looked at them more tenderly.\n\n\n \"Lutz, take Maine home!\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, we'll clean this place up!\"\n\n\n \"Maine, let's go!\"\n\n\n Lutz and his two brothers were suddenly united, and with their cooperation, I was taken outside the house in the blink of an eye. I wished I could see a little more brotherly interaction. What a pity.\n\n\n \"Maine, don't giggle, use your brain quickly! Have you got everything? Is there only Wilma's drawing left?\"\n\n\n Lutz forced a change of subject, apparently not wanting me to bring up his interactions with his brothers. I chuckled as I went over the tools needed to make a picture book. Paper, pigment, text template, roller, worktable were all ready. Now as soon as Wilma had finished the illustration, the inner pages of the picture book could be printed. However, if the cover was blank, it looked too lonely.\n\n\n \"Lutz, if you have time, make some paper with petals. I want it for the cover.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, you mean flower paper. It's very beautiful. I'll take the children to the forest tomorrow.\"\n\n\n All the preparations were done, I just needed to wait for Wilma to finish the illustration. So for a few afternoons, I could enjoy the world of reading. Today, after lunch, I was in high spirits to read a book when Gil, having received a notice from the children of the orphanage that Wilma had finished her illustration, came into the Dean's Office.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, I heard Wilma has finished her illustration template. The kids also said Wilma had something to ask for you, so please go to the orphanage in person.\"\n\n\n Hearing Gil's message, my world suddenly brightened. Having an illustration template meant I could start printing.\n\n\n \"Gil, please go to the workshop after lunch and get ready for printing. Rosina, let's go to the orphanage!\"\n\n\n \"Please calm down, Master Maine. The grace of god has not yet reached the orphanage.\"\n\n\n Then I remembered that my lunch hour was different from the orphanage, so I sat down again.\n\n\n Gil chuckled and said: \"I'll let you know when the kids come to the workshop. You can memorize the prayer in the meantime.\"\n\n\n His words reminded me of the assignment the Head Priest had given me.\n\n\n I followed Gil's advice, waiting restlessly while trying to memorize the prayer. I had heard that this was a prayer that I would use when the knights ask for blessings in the autumn. Because we didn't know when we were going to be asked suddenly, so the Head Priest wanted me to memorize it now.\n\n\n … Oh, I didn't know how the ceremonial dress was going, I would have to ask about it.\n\n\n After receiving the announcement that the children had finished lunch, I walked briskly to the orphanage with Rosina. The canteen was not far from the gate of the orphanage, and we soon met Wilma. Instead of her usual quiet smile, she looked nervous. There was a piece of paper on the table in front of her.\n\n\n \"Please look at it, Master Maine.\"\n\n\n \"Oh dear! \"\n\n\n Rosina looked over my shoulder at the paper and let out a cry of admiration.\n\n\n It was a beautifully cut template. Wilma's work had retained her delicate features, but the lines were more concise than before. This work showed the encounter between the god of darkness and the goddess of light. The lines of the god of darkness were more complicated than those of the goddess of light. However, although there was a lot of white space in the part of the goddess of light, Wilma still vividly showed the shadow of her hair and the folds of her clothes. I couldn't wait to see it in a picture book!\n\n\n \"Great! We're going to print it right now! I've told Gil to get ready.\"\n\n\n I asked Rosina to take the template and immediately got up to go to the workshop.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, please wait!\"\n\n\n Wilma stared at me with an expression of great determination. Several times her lips parted slightly; her hands clasped so hard that the tips of her fingers turned white. Finally she asked me in a trembling voice:\n\n\n \"May I accompany you to the workshop?\"\n\n\n \"Of course it's fine with me, but is it okay with you?\"\n\n\n Because of the fear of male contact, Wilma had refused to leave the orphanage. I heard she never showed up at the workshop. She said she was concerned about the children but was still too scared to move her feet.\n\n\n \"I'm still afraid of meeting men… but I'm too curious to do anything about what this picture looks like when it's printed. The previous print has not produced the effect I've imagined, and this time it's a new way of drawing. I have no idea what it's going to look like…\"\n\n\n I just thought the print was weird, but for Wilma, the result seemed like a blow. This time, instead of using black pigment to draw a delicate and beautiful picture, she cut the paper and made a simple silhouette. This was her first attempt, so I could understand her concern about the result.\n\n\n But once she went to the workshop, she was sure to meet the gray-robed priests. Could she bear the fear of men?\n\n\n \"If I go with Master Maine, I can summon up courage…\"\n\n\n Hearing Wilma say so, my worry flew out of the sky in an instant. Instead, I felt a sense of mission to protect her.\n\n\n \"I will never let a man come near you! Let's go!\"\n\n\n \"Master Maine, it was supposed to be that the attendants would never let a man near their master, was it?\"\n\n\n Rosina interjected in disapproval, but I didn't care! Wilma finally had the idea of wanting to step out of the orphanage, this was very rare, and she now regarded me as her support, this was the most important!\n\n\n Wilma put a hand on her chest and smiled uneasily, so I gently took her hand and walked down the steps at the back door of the canteen.\n\n\n … Wilma is protected by me! I must show my reliability!\n\n\n But no sooner had I set my sights on it than I nearly fell down the stairs. Luckily Wilma caught me in time to prevent a tragedy.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, are you okay?!\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, yeah. \"\n\n\n \"… Master Maine, it's all right to be so active, but please don't forget to be steady.\"\n\n\n Rosina's gentle reprimand stabbed me in the chest like a dagger."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"Wow! It's Wilma! Wilma is here!\"\n\n\n \"Wilma, Wilma, I just helped prepare the pigment!\"\n\n\n When the children saw Wilma, who had never left the orphanage appear in the workshop, they all cheered around her and began to talk about what they were doing and what they could do now. The children inadvertently formed a shield, making it impossible for the gray-robed priests to close to Wilma. So, while I was determined to protect her, I had no chance to show up.\n\n\n \"… let's start printing.\"\n\n\n Without the need to protect Wilma, I dropped my shoulders unwillingly and walked toward Lutz. Wilma followed me, surrounded by a shield formed by the children.\n\n\n \"Lutz, can you print the title page first? I want to see if we can apply the pigment evenly with the roller.\"\n\n\n Lutz placed the paper on the printing worktable and covered it with a template. The worktable was about A4 size and the template was A5 size. This time I was going to separate the illustration templates from the text templates.\n\n\n \"Is that right?\"\n\n\n Lutz confirmed with me, gently lowered the wooden frame with the net and took out the pigment. He mixed the pigment with oil on the marble table, and then rolled the roller over it.\n\n\n When he was ready, he gave me a look. When I nodded, he placed the roller on the net and began to roll it slowly. After several rolls, he placed the roller on the marble table and lifted the wooden frame. Because of the pigment, the template stuck to the net, leaving only the printed paper on the worktable.\n\n\n The text was actually printed on the paper, and the pigment was not uneven or dizzy.\n\n\n \"It's perfect. Please put it on the drying rack.\"\n\n\n After examining the printed title page, I handed the paper to a gray-robed priest and asked him to place it on the drying rack. Lutz immediately placed another piece of paper on the worktable and continued to print diligently. The templates made of thick paper could not be reused, so we must print as many as possible this time.\n\n\n I intended to print thirty copies first, including one for my family, one for the Dean's Office, one for Lutz, one for Benno and one for the Head Priest. The rest will be sent to the orphanage as textbooks.\n\n\n \"Go on to the inside pages and illustrations. Please get ready.\"\n\n\n Hearing my instructions, Wilma's face showed a trace of tension. Lutz discreetly removed the title page template and replaced it with the illustration template. For ease of reading, picture books took the form of text on the left and illustrations on the right. In addition, because the paper needed to be folded in half during binding, there was a space between the text and the illustration.\n\n\n I noticed that Wilma and Rosina were both looking at me, so I looked back and nodded to them. Lutz's expression was as tense as Wilma's. He took the roller and started printing. My heart was beating as fast as his movements. Would the illustration be beautiful when it was printed? Would it satisfy Wilma? Finally, Lutz dropped the roller and raised the frame, and in that instant I felt the people around me catch their breath.\n\n\n \"… wow! How beautiful!\"\n\n\n The first people to express their admiration were the children around Wilma.\n\n\n This illustration vividly showed the encounter between the God of Darkness and the Goddess of Light in black and white. When I saw the template, I foresaw that the printed illustration would be great, and my hunch was further confirmed by the stark contrast of black and white after coloring. The God of Darkness in a cloak as black as night which was to envelop the Goddess of Light, and the Goddess of Light who illuminated the God of Darkness, both seemed to come alive. Shadows and folds were not noticeable on the template, but were delicately presented after printing.\n\n\n \"It's so beautiful.\"\n\n\n While admiring, I turned my eyes to Wilma, only to find her staring with tearful eyes at the printed illustration.\n\n\n \"Wilma, are you all right?!\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry, I… I'm just so relieved and happy that…\"\n\n\n Wilma wiped away her tears and said in a broken voice. In order to comfort her, the children patted her on the back in perplexity and said to her, \"Wilma, don't cry.\" Wilma who was unable to control her tears of joy, and the children who were comforting her -- I thought this scene was more like a masterpiece of religious drawing.\n\n\n … Wilma was really a saint.\n\n\n So all eyes turned to Wilma with rosy cheeks and glittering tears. Finding herself in the spotlight, she blushed and turned to leave.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, I… I'm going back to draw the next illustration.\"\n\n\n After the success of the first illustration, whenever Wilma finished an illustration, we printed it. During the time that Wilma devoted herself to the illustrations, the children were working hard to make papers, and the gray-robed priests were working hard to make pigments. At the same time, we dried the fruits and mushrooms collected from the forest and began to buy wood for the winter.\n\n\n \"Maine, all the Scriptures have been printed today. What will you do next?\"\n\n\n Lutz said as we were walking home one day in late autumn. Oh, my god. All the inside pages were printed. After printing, it was binding. Books were finally coming!\n\n\n \"The next step is binding! I must go to the workshop tomorrow!\"\n\n\n \"You needn't go. I just want an explanation.\"\n\n\n I was ablue-robed trainee priestess, so whenever I was present, the gray-robed priests had their concerns, and I only interfered with them. But how could I suppress my desire to participate in the process of making books? After all, the next step was a brand new one.\n\n\n \"It doesn't matter if I can only participate in the beginning. I want to participate. I want to see it with my own eyes. As long as I make sure everything is going well, I won't step into the workshop again as I did in the printing process.Promise me, Lutz, please!\"\n\n\n \"… only in the beginning.\"\n\n\n \"Ha-ha, hooray!! My books! Books!\"\n\n\n I was so happy that I began to spin. Lutz took my arm and walked on, I followed him but kept giggling. Seeing this, he released his hand and took a board out of his bag.\n\n\n \"Ok, you explain… what is binding? \"\n\n\n \"Binding means connecting the pages. Because the inside pages were printed with text on the left and illustrations on the right, fold them in half. Be careful to fold the text and illustrations inwards. This task requires flat worktables, so it might be better to do it in the orphanage canteen.\"\n\n\n I explained slowly as I watched Lutz's writing speed.\n\n\n \"Make a pile of papers when you're done. Remember, never disturb the order of the papers or turn them upside down. Oh, yes! Don't forget to cut the title and back pages with the penknife first.\"\n\n\n The next afternoon, I waited in the orphanage canteen. Soon the printed papers were carried in. Every table in the canteen was scrubbed to keep the papers from getting dirty. Looking at the stacks of paper in front of me, I was overjoyed. The smell of new paper and pigment really made my heart skip a beat.\n\n\n \"All right, team leaders, come and take your share.\"\n\n\n In order to facilitate management, I divided the workshop interns into several groups, led by the gray-robed priests to supervise them. As for children too young to be interns, Gil suggested keeping them out of the job because we didn't know if they could handle it. So the young children were cooking soup with Wilma.\n\n\n Lutz explained to everyone what to watch out for, such as the edges must be aligned, not folded backwards, and taken to Master Maine for inspection when finished. Then work began.\n\n\n \"Please align the edges a bit more neatly. First press here and here, then like this…\"\n\n\n I walked slowly through the groups, teaching them how to fold paper. In this city, paper was very expensive that people couldn't see it in their daily life, so it was natural that no one had ever folded paper. So even the gray-robed priests couldn't fold the paper neatly.\n\n\n Ah… My precious pages were ragged!\n\n\n In the face of this reality which could not be ignored, I scratched my head in distress and whispered to Lutz.\n\n\n \"Lutz, can't I do it myself?\"\n\n\n \"Just bear with it for a while.\"\n\n\n … Uh-huh! I should have let everyone practice with wastepaper!\n\n\n I wondered what would happen? I watched with trepidation as more and more pages were folded. After the inspection, I returned the bad ones and asked the staff to fold them again. How could those jagged pages be made into a book, even if others could accept it, I couldn't!\n\n\n All the pages were folded and arranged on the table. The first step in binding would be completed by stacking the pages from top to bottom in order.\n\n\n I was asked to make little manuals when I was still Urano, so it wasn't new to me, but it was a first for everyone else.\n\n\n \"Please take the last page first, then move to the side, take another page from the next stack and cover the last page, move to the side again… keep doing this until there are no more pages.Never turn the pages over or take two at a time. Please be careful.\"\n\n\n As I spoke, I whipped out a page. If I could staple up the pages, it would be done quickly, but there's nothing that convenient here."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n When I returned to my seat after taking all the pages, I found Fran looking at me with a grave face and sighing. I knew he meant to tell me not to do things by myself, but I ignored him. I did this not only to demonstrate to the staff, but also to make sure that my own book was perfect.\n\n\n \"I want to take these home, so I’m sorry for taking the liberty.\"\n\n\n While the staff was stacking the other pages in order, I carefully refolded mine and pressed the creases flat with my fingernails. The paper for double-sided printing is very thick, so I should have prepared spatulas and rulers. No, considering the possibility of refolding, it's better not to use scrapers.\n\n\n Since the printed pages were only for thirty books, they were soon stacked. I asked the staff to divide them into three piles and carry them carefully back to the workshop.\n\n\n \"Tools are needed for the next step, so let's call it a day. Go and rest.\"\n\n\n I just wanted to go home early and continue binding. I put my share in my bag and asked Lutz to go back to the workshop and get a piece of flower paper for the cover.\n\n\n \"If you want to continue at home, I'll go and help. It's better to see you do it than to hear you explain it.\"\n\n\n The gelatin wasn't ready yet, and I didn't have anything to replace it. Therefore, I intended to make the children's edition of the Scripture into a thread-bound book.\n\n\n \"I'm back!\"\n\n\n \"Welcome home, Maine. It's so early today. Oh, Lutz is back with you.\"\n\n\n When we got home, Turi had already come back from the forest. I took the pages from my bag and showed them to her.\n\n\n \"Turi, look! This is the Scripture for the children!It's finally printed.\"\n\n\n \"Wow, this picture book is great!\"\n\n\n Turi flipped through the pages with a cry of excitement. As for the black and white picture book I made for the babies, she seemed to have no idea what the advantages were, so I pursed my lips as she praised the children's edition of the Scripture.\n\n\n \"But wouldn't it be difficult to read them separately?\"\n\n\n \"So it's going to be a real book. Can you help me bind them? If you can go to the workshop later and teach the people there how to do it, that would be great, because I can't do anything in the workshop.\"\n\n\n I asked, taking the flower paper from my bag to be the cover and placing it on the table.Turi tilted her head.\n\n\n \"It's all right to help, but can I do it?\"\n\n\n \"Because it's needlework, I think you would do a better job than I would.\"\n\n\n \"I see. I'll help you. Will you give me a copy of this book? I want to learn to write, too.\"\n\n\n Turi said shyly. She must have been inspired by seeing how Lutz and I wrote on the board and how Corinna took notes while taking orders. Her request was a piece of cake. I could even be her governess for her sake.\n\n\n \"I'll keep a copy of this picture book at home, so let's read it together.I'm not a good tailor but a good teacher. I'm going to teach the children in the orphanage to write this winter, so you can learn with them. You'll learn faster if you have competitors.\"\n\n\n I rummaged in my father's toolbox and took out the tools for binding books, such as the ruler, the awl, the hammer and the board.\n\n\n \"First, check that the edges of the pages are aligned, because you can't change them later, and then flatten the outside crease completely with a spatula and ruler… like this.\"\n\n\n I showed Lutz and Turi how to flatten the outside creases with a ruler, and they did the same.\n\n\n \"Once you've flattened it out, check the alignment again, then stand the pages up and tap them, keep the spine… err, the seam in a straight line, and then you can punch and bind.\"\n\n\n I put the pages on the board, measured them with a ruler and made three small marks with a soot pencil.\n\n\n \"Lutz, punch where I marked. Stand up the awl and hammer it down, and the hole will be made straight. \"\n\n\n After aligning the pages, I pressed the pages, and Lutz asked me, \"here?\" With my approval, he punched where I had marked.\n\n\n \"Turi, please thread from the front through the hole right in the middle first. Next, thread through the first hole from the back, then the third hole from the front, then the center hole from the back.\"\n\n\n It would have taken me a long time to do it, but Turi was used to it because of her work, so she did it very quickly.Then I asked her to cut the rest of the threads short and tie the one that ran up and down with two threads coming out of the center. After cutting off the end, I asked Lutz to knock the knot gently down with the hammer.\n\n\n \"When the knot is knocked in, the surface becomes very flat.\"\n\n\n When this was done, Lutz wrote down the binding steps on a writing board. Meanwhile, I held the ruler over the spine and cut out the irregularities with a penknife.\n\n\n \"Actually, the next step should be to cover the corners, but since there is no paste, let's skip this step and add the cover first.Beautiful paper made from flowers and leaves will come in handy.\"\n\n\n When I folded the flower paper in half, Turi looked over and said, \"Wow, that's cute.\"\n\n\n \"Right? First, cut this paper in half and add it to the front and back of the book.Then, place the ruler on the binding position, gently draw a line with the awl, and finally punch the holes after measuring the distance as before. \"\n\n\n Instead of using a soot pencil, I used an awl to make four dents so as not to stain the cover. But I didn't have the strength to punch, which made me a little sad.\n\n\n \"Then it's my turn.\"\n\n\n Lutz took the hammer and began to punch. Perhaps anticipating the imminent needlework, Turi had made preparations in advance.\n\n\n \"Thread through the second hole from the back, around the back of the book, and through the back again… yes, yes, that's it.Next, leave a thread about the length of your index finger, open the book, pull it in, and hide it between the pages.\"\n\n\n \"Like this?\"\n\n\n \"Push the thread in a little more with the needle. Yes, that's great. After you've finished with the rest of the thread, run a new thread through the third hole from the front, around the back of the book, and through the front again.\"\n\n\n Turi threaded with great speed, muttering, \"I can't believe it's so easy.\" All she had to do was run the threads through the holes in order, and as long as the order was not wrong, the threading itself was not difficult, she just had to be careful not to let the threads loose.\n\n\n \"When you get the thread around the top of the book, turn the book over to the back, and it's the last step.Cross the thread like this, and it will tie itself.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, amazing.\"\n\n\n Turi followed my instructions and was surprised to see that the knot had actually formed.\n\n\n \"Then pull hard on the thread, tie it tight, run it through the second hole and pull the knot into the hole so it won't come loose easily.\"\n\n\n \"Wow, that's awesome!\"\n\n\n Lutz's eyes widened. Turi pulled several times to get the knot into the hole, but it never worked. Then she gently pushed the knot down with the needle and pulled again.\n\n\n \"The only thing left is to cut the thread…\"\n\n\n I felt a fever in my chest as the book was about to be finished. My whole body seemed to be constricted and my throat was shaking. My vision became blurred and the book in front of me became distorted.\n\n\n \"Cut it off, Maine.\"\n\n\n Lutz handed me the scissors, and Turi nodded slightly, pulling hard at the thread between the book and the needle. I took the scissors in a trembling hand and leaned them against the thread. Then, with only a slight movement, the thread snapped.\n\n\n At the same time, my tears burst. I couldn't stop the hot tears running down my cheeks.\n\n\n \"It's done… it's done, Lutz.\"\n\n\n It was not a lump of clay, or a block of wood, or a pile of paper, or a black-and-white picture book without a word, but a book that I could positively declare \"it's a book!\"\n\n\n \"… it's been a long time. It's really been a long time.\"\n\n\n It had been about two years since I had made up my mind to make the book, and it had finally been finished. It was like a dream. Lutz, who had been working with me on the book, smiled with a sense of accomplishment and then burst into tears.\n\n\n \"That's good, Maine.\"\n\n\n Lutz opened his arms to me. I hugged him tightly and nodded several times. If I was alone, nothing could be done. I got where I am because of his support.\n\n\n \"Thanks for all your help, thank you. I'm so happy, so happy. I've made the book. The book of my dreams…\"\n\n\n I dared not touch the newly finished book with my tearful hands, but stared at it, not wanting to stain it. It was just a thin, thread-bound picture book, but I couldn't stop crying when I thought of how much had happened along the way to finish it. No strength, no money, no paper, no pigment, no tools. The challenge that began with nothing had now come to fruition.\n\n\n While I was still basking in the happiness, Lutz gave me a combative smile.\n\n\n \"But there's only one. You want more than you can read. Do you, Maine?\"\n\n\n Lutz's emerald eyes were fixed on the next target. In order to achieve our ambition, we must continue to challenge one after another. I wiped my tears away and grinned.\n\n\n \"Yes, I want so many books that I can open a library. Because we agreed.\""

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Today Turi went to the workshop to teach the staff how to bind picture books. Though I wanted to be there to cheer them on, Lutz turned me down: \"your presence will only cause problems.\" In that case, I had to give up.\n\n\n \"Fran, will you come with me to the library today?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n Fran and Rosina were now recording the types and amounts of food consumed by the orphanage in a month to work out how much to prepare for the winter. Before long, crops would be brought into the city in large quantities, and then everyone would begin to prepare for the winter, so it was important to get ready before then. It was also the first time the orphanage was truly prepared for winter.\n\n\n \"If you're busy, I can go to the library with Rosina…\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to send Rosina to Wilma on business, and I have to bring some boards to the library, so please don't worry.\"\n\n\n With many things in the basket, such as boards and pigments, Fran went with me to the library. The glare of the sun fell on the gloomy corridors of the temple, making me feel the last warmth of the summer.\n\n\n From the corridor I could see several carriages parked in the vestibule that connected the aristocratic quarter. There was a lot of luggage piled up on the carriage. It seemed that the blue-robed priests were going on a long journey.\n\n\n \"… there are a lot of carriages. What's the matter?\"\n\n\n \"Those are the carriages for the blue-robed priests. At this time they go out to the Harvest Festival.\"\n\n\n \"The Harvest Festival?… I haven't heard of it.\"\n\n\n In autumn, more could be gathered in the forest, and the harvest of the countryside would continue to flood the market. It was the season when the whole city began to prepare for winter. I knew that at this time of year everyone was having a festival when they were working with their neighbors on the pork, but I had never heard of a Harvest Festival.\n\n\n \"Is it a festival peculiar to the temple?… but it is not a temple ritual, is it?\"\n\n\n I did not remember the Harvest Festival being mentioned to me by Fran and the Head Priest when they introduced me to the temple rituals.\n\n\n \"Oh, don't commoners know?\"\n\n\n The sudden strange voice startled me. I turned to find a man in travelling clothes, who seemed to be a nobleman, looking down at me contemptuously. He was not the blue-robed priest I had met at the Star Festival, but since he was not wearing the blue-robe, I could not immediately tell whether he was a blue-robed priest or a nobleman who had come to the temple to see the blue-robed priest. I quickly leaned my back against the wall, knelt down and crossed my hands in front of my chest. It was a gesture of respect from the lower to the higher. In the temple, the people in blue were all equal, and there was no need to bow to each other until we met the Temple Chief and the Head Priest. It was a rule I had learned, but I was a commoner, and it's safer to be humble than to get in trouble for not being polite.\n\n\n \"Hum, you know where you stand. The Head Priest was right. There's no need to go out of my way to teach you.\"\n\n\n Seeing me on my knees at once, the man was clearly satisfied, and after saying something that made me care, he left. I seemed to have dodged an argument. The words \"you know where you stand\" made me realize that this man was a blue-robed priest. For if he was a nobleman, he would naturally think that others ought to kneel to him.\n\n\n \"You are equal, Master Maine. You need not kneel before him.\"\n\n\n \"Even so, I am not an aristocrat after all. He is completely superior to me. What does it matter if I kneel to avoid trouble?\"\n\n\n Fran lowered his gaze.\n\n\n \"But in this way, other blue-robed priests will despise you.\"\n\n\n \"It doesn't matter. My position is difficult to judge. It would be bad if I offended the blue-robed priests and made them turn against the orphanage.\"\n\n\n No one who knew that I had lost control of my power in front of the Temple Chief would dare to challenge me. But now that I had the title of Orphanage Director, they might use the orphanage to oppress me.\n\n\n \"If you have your own considerations, that's all right, but sometimes you must show your majesty.\"\n\n\n With a troubled look on his face, France went on to the library. \"I don't have any majesty,\" I thought. If Fran wanted me to be a majestic master, I would try, but it's probably not that easy.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, please come in.\"\n\n\n Fran opened the door of the library for me. Just as I was about to step into the library as usual, I froze.\n\n\n \"What is this?!\"\n\n\n The library was a mess. The parchment and boards that had been on the two shelves were scattered on the floor, and I couldn't even get through the door. This was not an accident in any way, it was clearly done on purpose.\n\n\n My anger shot up. In a world where there were no books and few written materials, the existence of this library was a miracle. What kind of person would do such a thing! It was necessary to bring justice to the foolish guy who did not understand how valuable the things gathered here were!\n\n\n \"Oh ha ha, who is it? Who would dare to do such a stupid thing…\"\n\n\n The magic that filled my whole body was encouraging me to catch the culprit at once and offered him a Blood Carnival!\n\n\n \"Master Maine! Let us first report to the Head Priest. Then we may know who was the last to use the library.\"\n\n\n Fran grabbed me by the shoulder anxiously from behind. He realized that my power was about to run out of control and had to hide behind me to avoid being affected. It was only when I saw the normally steady Fran do this that I calmed down. It took me a long time to master my power. If I wanted to unleash my power from anger, it's only against that culprit. I could never make Fran feel afraid, or spread my anger to those around me, or to the Head Priest. I tried to press the power back into my body and smiled at Fran.\n\n\n \"That's right. Let's go to the Head Priest.\"\n\n\n As I had not made an appointment with the Head Priest, I remained in the waiting room at the request of Fran. As I sat still, I could feel someone moving along the corridor. Probably the blue-robed priests who were getting ready to go out. Think of here, I suddenly recalled just that blue-robed priest said. Did he say, \"there's no need to go out of my way to teach you\"?\n\n\n … That's him!\n\n\n I sprang to my feet. How could I continue to sit here when I knew who the culprit was? He's getting ready for a trip. I must catch him before he escaped!\n\n\n I jumped at the handle, but at about the same time, someone opened the door from outside. I watched the door slam against me. I was knocked off my feet and fell backwards to the ground.\n\n\n \"Master Maine?! What are you doing…?\"\n\n\n The man who opened the door was Fran. I grabbed his hand and got up quickly, then tried to rush out of the waiting room, but was stopped by Fran.\n\n\n \"What's the matter, Master Maine?\"\n\n\n \"I know who destroyed my library! I may catch him if I run after him now! Please let me go!\"\n\n\n \"Please report this to the Head Priest. He is waiting for you.\"\n\n\n Fran picked me up and went straight to the Head Priest's office.\n\n\n The Head Priest raised one eyebrow slightly and looked back and forth at Fran and me in his arm.\n\n\n \"What's going on?\"\n\n\n \"Master Maine said she knew who the culprit was and had an impulse to run to the vestibule, which is why I had to…\"\n\n\n \"Well done, it was a wise decision.\"\n\n\n After comforting him and instructing him to lower me, the Head Priest lifted his chin at me and motioned me to go with him to the secret room.\n\n\n … Instead of a secret room, it might now be called a lecture room.\n\n\n I was depressed at the thought of what was to come, but I followed the Head Priest into the secret room. I sat down on the bench as usual. The Head Priest also drew up a chair and sat down. He stroked his chin and looked at me."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"I heard from Fran that someone has broken up the library.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, everything on both shelves was thrown to the floor, and there was not even a gap to step into. Isn't that a felony punishable by death?!\"\n\n\n I complained with a strong voice, but the Head Priest overruled me by waving his hand.\n\n\n \"Not that much, little fool… so, you already know who the culprit is?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. As I was on my way to the library, a blue-robed priest who was going to leave the temple said to me, \"there's no need to go out of my way to teach you.\" so it must be him.\"\n\n\n \"That being said, there are five blue-robed priests who are going to the Harvest Festival today. Which one do you mean?\"\n\n\n Although I saw several carriages, I did not expect that there were as many as five people going out today.\n\n\n \"I don't know. But I know his face.\"\n\n\n \"They won't be back for about ten days. Will you remember then?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest asked me in a skeptical tone, and I gave him a vigorous nod.\n\n\n \"I shall never forget the man who did so to the library.\"\n\n\n \"I'd be grateful if you'd forget…\"\n\n\n The Head Priest said with a long sigh, staring at me angrily. But even if I were to be stared at, I would never spare the foolish man who had done that. I decided to change the subject.\n\n\n \"By the way, what is the Harvest Festival? I've never heard of it.\"\n\n\n \"Because it's not your thing. The Harvest Festival is a village festival in the territory, which is…\"\n\n\n The Head Priest then began to explain what the Harvest Festival was. His lengthy explanation even referred to myths, but in a word, it was an activity in which tax collectors and blue-robed priests went to the countryside to collect crops.\n\n\n \"Nominally it's about taxing the state and collecting offerings for the gods, but taking away crops like that is not a good thing for the countryside.\"\n\n\n \"Don't be so explicit. Taking away the crops is not the whole of the Harvest Festival. The priests will hold various rituals for the villagers.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest coughed and glared at me. I guessed I had to be a little more tactful, but the aristocrat's choice of words was hard to learn.\n\n\n \"Are village rituals held in the autumn?\"\n\n\n \"After the harvest, exactly.\"\n\n\n I saw. For from the time the snow melted until the autumn harvest, the farmers had no leisure. In winter, the farmers would be trapped in the snow, so they had a lot of leisure, but then the priests who held the rituals could not go to the countryside. Although the Harvest Festival was for tax purposes only, the timing was reasonable.\n\n\n \"Especially the Star-union. If the newlyweds do not attend this ritual and are not blessed and registered, they will not be recognized as a couple in the winter house, and there will be no new house or fields for the following spring.\"\n\n\n \"What is a winter house?\"\n\n\n \"It's a country house for the winter. Life in the city is very different from that in the country. In the summer, the farmers will live in separate houses in the fields to make it easier for them to farm. But in the winter, when they can't farm, they will live together in a large house in the center of the countryside. I don't know the details, though.\"\n\n\n I still didn't quite understand, but the Head Priest said he didn't know the details, so there’s no need to ask.\n\n\n \"So, the Harvest Festival isn't my thing?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. At the meeting to decide who to send to the countryside, the Temple Chief shouted that sending you would reduce the crops they receive.\"\n\n\n I was not surprised that the Temple Chief, who had always seen me as a thorn in his side, would say that. I had been so busy that I had almost forgotten about him, but he did not seem to have forgotten me, which made me laugh and cry. The Harvest Festival was a valuable opportunity for the blue-robed priests to increase their income, so they must have agreed with the Temple Chief.\n\n\n \"Some of the countryside is so remote that a long journey can be a burden on your health. To make sure the spring blessing rituals go well, you’d better not to go to the Harvest Festival.\"\n\n\n I was a little puzzled by the answer of the Head Priest.\n\n\n \"Do you mean I'm going to the countryside in the spring?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. You and I will be sent to ensure the power for the rituals.\"\n\n\n I knew the rituals were held in the spring, but I never knew they were held in the countryside.\n\n\n \"But I can't bear travelling in a carriage! \"\n\n\n \"I know. But it's important to have rituals. We accepted all your conditions to get you into the temple because the rituals required your power. Have you forgotten?\"\n\n\n \"… no.\"\n\n\n \"That's good. As hard as it will be for you, don't forget how hard it will be for me to travel with you as your guardian.\"\n\n\n … Was the Head Priest destined to labor all his life? But I swallowed back these words that almost came out of my mouth. I must keep in mind that \"misfortunes come from the mouth\".\n\n\n \"Actually, I am not at ease about handing you over to another priest. It would be safer for me to do it myself. \"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to trouble you.\" I crossed my hands in front of my chest and bowed my head.\n\n\n \"Well, what are you going to do about the library?\"\n\n\n Hearing this, I raised my mouth and clenched my fist.\n\n\n \"A Blood Carnival, of course!\"\n\n\n \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\n \"I meant to make an example of him by offering him a Blood Sacrifice. He's declared war on me by destroying the library. I must punish him!\"\n\n\n The action of that blue-robed priest was a clear declaration of war. I was asked by Fran to be a majestic master, and this was my chance.\n\n\n \"Calm down! His crimes are not enough to warrant a Blood Sacrifice, either by destroying the library or by keeping you out of the Harvest Festival. You are going too far!\"\n\n\n I thought it was just the right thing to do, but the Head Priest clearly didn't approve.\n\n\n \"Did he make a mess of the library just to keep me out of the Harvest Festival?\"\n\n\n \"Well, probably. The collections in the library are arranged according to the order in which they are received, so he was trying to find fault with you for not being able to arrange them. To be honest, even I don't know what's in the library.\"\n\n\n I had an epiphany when the Head Priest said, \"he was trying to find fault with you for not being able to arrange them.\" This was a stark challenge. It was the last straw that the culprit thought I could not arrange the library!\n\n\n \"Then I'll take the challenge.\"\n\n\n \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n \"I'll do the library. But as I don't know the order of the past, I'll do it my way. Please turn a blind eye.\"\n\n\n Came to think of it, wasn't this a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me? I could take this opportunity to create my own library. I could manage all the books using a taxonomy. No one else wanted to clean up after that mess, so I could do whatever I wanted. In that case, I owed it to the culprit.\n\n\n \"If it is to trouble me, no one else will do it. After all, I am the one who uses the library most.\"\n\n\n \"I'm a little worried about your sudden change of mood, but all right. After all, you're not going to be rude to the library, so I'll leave it to you.\"\n\n\n When I returned to the Head Priest's Office, Fran cast a worried look at me. He seemed worried that I would lose my temper. As soon as I saw him, an important thing occurred to me. I couldn't reach the top of the bookshelf, and neither could Gil and Delia, who worked as attendants. Fran would be tired if he was the only one to help me.\n\n\n \"Head Priest, may I ask the gray-robed priests of the orphanage to help me with the library? Besides, do you have a catalogue? If so, I shall know what is in the library.\"\n\n\n \"OK. It is impossible to rely on the help of your attendants alone. Besides, I have only the catalogue of the part which I sent, and the rest I do not know. If there is, it is at the Temple Chief.\"\n\n\n With a catalog, I'll know how to use the taxonomy. I looked up in anticipation at the Head Priest.\n\n\n \"Could you lend it to me, please?\"\n\n\n \"Yes.\" On hearing this, Arnaud immediately handed me the catalogue. He was still a good and able attendant.\n\n\n \"Thank you, Head Priest. If you'll excuse me.\"\n\n\n When we got to the corridor, Fran asked me in fear:\n\n\n \"Master Maine, you seem to be in a good mood, don't you?\"\n\n\n \"Haha, yes, I am in a good mood. I even want to thank the culprit and god!\"\n\n\n \"May I ask why?\"\n\n\n \"Now the library can be arranged as I please. There is nothing so delightful as that! Don't you think so?\"\n\n\n I had planned to search the library shelves for new reading goals. Now I can also arrange according to my preference, which is really killing two birds with one stone.\n\n\n I finally feel like a librarian! Muster up my energy!"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"Fran, go to the workshop and bring the three gray-robed priests and the attendants other than Wilma.\"\n\n\n \"What are you going to do, Master Maine?\"\n\n\n \"I will stay in the library and read the catalog that the Head Priest lent me, and then think about how to sort the files.\"\n\n\n Entering the library, Fran first picked up the files at the door and cleared the way for me. He put down the catalogue and hurried out of the library after I had sat down.\n\n\n After seeing Fran go, I looked at the catalogue of the Head Priest. It was filled with tiny words, scrawled in such a way as to say to the others, \"as long as the Head Priest himself can understand it.\"\n\n\n \"What books did the Head Priest bring into the temple… wow, so many?!\"\n\n\n The number of books brought into the temple by the Head Priest was considerable, so to speak, the personal belongings of him occupied more than one bookshelf in the library.\n\n\n … Head Priest, who were you?!\n\n\n The only certainty was that he was unbelievably rich. I had heard him say that he entered the temple for some reason, but it seemed that he came from a wealthy upper-class family. How else could he bring into the temple five books that were very valuable?\n\n\n Usually, books with leather covers and gold and precious stones were not personal but were considered heirlooms. However, the fact that the Head Priest brought five books into the temple for all to read increased my opinion of him.\n\n\n \"It's really nice to bring so many books in for everyone to read…\"\n\n\n After I roughly assigned the classification code according to the catalog, I began to think about which bookshelf should correspond to which classification code, but then I suddenly encountered a problem.\n\n\n \"Which category should files about magic fall into?\"\n\n\n This was nerve-racking because there was no magic in the Nippon Decimal Classification. But I didn't know if it's because it was an area that only the aristocrats could explore, or an area that needed to be studied, but in the personal files of the Head Priest, magic was the most relevant.\n\n\n I wrote down the Japanese classification system on the board.\n\n\n 0 Collection (Library, encyclopedias, general papers, journals, groups, news, series)\n\n\n 1 Philosophy (Philosophy, psychology, ethics, religion)\n\n\n 2 History (History, biography, geography)\n\n\n 3 Social Sciences (Politics, law, economy, statistics, society, education, customs, national defense)\n\n\n 4 Natural Sciences (Mathematics, science, medicine)\n\n\n 5 Technology (Engineering, industry, home economics)\n\n\n 6 Industries (Agriculture, forestry, aquaculture, commerce, transportation, communications)\n\n\n 7 Arts (Art, music, drama, sport, entertainment)\n\n\n 8 Languages\n\n\n 9 Literature\n\n\n Considering the making of magic tools, could I see it as a technique? Or was the magic here closer to mathematics and science? Although I wanted to use the Nippon Decimal Classification, it was difficult because of the differences in common sense.\n\n\n \"Anyway, I'll read the files first. They should be here…\"\n\n\n I looked at the scattered things on the floor, the corners of my mouth turned up.\n\n\n It was magic! I was about to see real magic for the first time! Just by imagining it, my heart was pounding.\n\n\n In addition to the magic-related files, everything else should be classified in the usual way, so when the attendants and the gray-robed priests arrive, I would let them move the files to the table to clear the space for walking. Then, I would mark the classification code of the first-level category on the shelves, and then ask the attendants to put the files I had passed into the corresponding shelf. I hoped that at least this stage could be completed today, and later I would slowly work out a catalog and subdivide the files. At present, it seemed that I could not directly follow the second-level classification method of the Nippon Decimal Classification, and it must be greatly adjusted.\n\n\n \"My god! What happened?!\"\n\n\n Hearing the familiar yell, I looked at the door and saw Delia's face bristling with anger. Her job was to keep my room tidy, so she got angry whenever it got messy. Surely the misery of the library was too much for her. Behind Delia, there were other attendants and three gray-robed priests, all of whom were silent at the sight of the library.\n\n\n \"Wow, that's too bad. I don't know who did it, but it was Master Maine he offended. It seems that man really didn't care for his life.\"\n\n\n Gil knew very well how much I valued books, and when I heard him say this, I saw Fran was rubbing his stomach.\n\n\n \"Fran, what's the matter? Do you have a stomachache?\"\n\n\n \"I just thought about what the culprit is going to face…\"\n\n\n I couldn't believe Fran was so worried about the fate of the culprit that his stomach ached. I put my hand to my cheek, cocked my head, and said:\n\n\n \"That's a bother. If Fran is so worried about him, wouldn't it be better to stop the Blood Sacrifice? I thought it would be a good chance to give the enemies a warning, boost our morale and show my majesty as the master.\"\n\n\n \"Wait, Master Maine! You won't boost our morale this way! We'll be too scared to move!\"\n\n\n When I had finished speaking, not only the attendants, but also the gray-robed priests, drew back stiffly in unison, and only Fran came up to me, knelt down, took my hands, and begged very earnestly:\n\n\n \"Master Maine, please do stop. You look very majestic to me.\"\n\n\n \"Really? Then I'll stop the Blood Sacrifice. Let's tidy up here today.\"\n\n\n I decided to forget about the Blood Sacrifice because of the earnestness in Fran's pleading eyes. Rather than holding a Blood Sacrifice, it is more enjoyable to tidy up the library.\n\n\n \"First of all, please be careful not to step on the files. You can stack them on this table separately by parchment and board. Besides, please clear a way for us to walk to the bookshelves.\"\n\n\n \"Yes,\" they all answered. With a slight nod, I continued to explain the work ahead.\n\n\n \"After all the files are picked up, Fran and I will classify and number them, so please put them on the corresponding bookshelf later. The top shelf of the left bookshelf is 0 and the middle one is 1. Please leave the bottom one empty. The top two shelves of the right bookshelf are 2, and the bottom one is 3. The other files will be sorted out last. When placing the files on the bookshelves, please do not care about the order, just be careful not to put them in the wrong shelf.\"\n\n\n Everyone began to gather up the scattered files. Only Fran sat down beside me. He blinked in confusion at being assigned a different job than the others.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by classification, Master Maine?\"\n\n\n \"That's what it means! This is the Maine Decimal Classification Table. Please refer to this table to decide which shelf the files should be placed in. If you are not sure, you can ask me and I will tell you.\"\n\n\n I handed the writing board to Fran to show him how to sort the files. Meanwhile, the parchment and boards piled on the table grew taller and taller. Fran and I quickly looked at the files at hand and classified them by code.\n\n\n \"Rosina, if there's a way to the bookshelf, please put these in shelf one.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, Master Maine.\"\n\n\n Because these were files that were in the temple, there's a lot of philosophical stuff. There were also a lot of files in history and social science. What impressed me most was the recording of the statistics on the amount of harvest and supply in each village. But they were all old, not recent. I hadn't seen any language or literature files.\n\n\n \"Delia, you've got parchment in your scroll! Be careful.\"\n\n\n \"What a nuisance! Don't come running in while I'm rolling the scrolls!\"\n\n\n Perhaps embarrassed by what I said, Delia roared while rolling the scrolls. Rosina giggled and picked up the parchment scattered around her. The scrolls had a fixed placement area, so I didn't sort them. When the scrolls were put away, the floor of the library was finally exposed.\n\n\n \"Gil, give these to the priest next to shelf two.\"\n\n\n The files scattered on the floor were not in the form of books, so they vary in size. Seeing the gray-robed priests struggling with the ever-falling parchment, I suddenly wanted as many boxes and folders as possible to organize them. This world didn't even have a bookend.\n\n\n \"Why don't I ask John?\"\n\n\n \"Master Maine?\"\n\n\n \"No, nothing. Rosina, take this board to that priest. Tell him he can hold the parchment with it.\"\n\n\n Although the library was in a mess, the cabinet containing valuable books, which needed the keys of the Temple Chief and the Head Priest, remained intact, and chained books showed no signs of being treated rudely. It seemed that the culprit really messed up the files just to get me into trouble.\n\n\n The stuff on both shelves was scattered all over the place, so it seemed like there were a lot of files, but when sorted, there were surprisingly few, and there wasn't much parchment and boards for me and Fran to sort.\n\n\n \"And that's it?\"\n\n\n It wasn't long before the parchment and boards were back on the shelves, and my eyes widened in surprise.\n\n\n \"Yes, it was quicker than I thought. It's a nice system to help with quick sorting.\"\n\n\n \"Today, I just made a general classification according to the first-level category. In the future, I plan to make further subdivision for the convenience of finding files. Since the classification code must be coded according to the actual content of the file, it may take some effort, but it will be very satisfying.\"\n\n\n Fran smiled reassuringly. I got up and looked around the library, glad to see that the scattered files had really been put back on the bookshelves. But the shelf where I expected to put the files of the Head Priest was empty. All the files had been sorted, but there were no magic-related files in the catalogue of the Head Priest.\n\n\n \"What's the matter, Master Maine?\"\n\n\n The call of Fran brought me back to my senses, and I found that the attendants and the gray-robed priests were standing in a row, waiting for my instructions. I had to tell them the work was done and dismiss them.\n\n\n \"Thanks to your help for finishing this quickly. Thank you.\"\n\n\n Fran was returning the key to the library to the Head Priest, so I decided to go with him. For magic-related files, I had some questions to ask the Head Priest.\n\n\n \"I want to report the results and return the catalogue to the Head Priest, and I have something to ask him.\"\n\n\n \"What do you want to ask?\"\n\n\n \"It's just that I didn't see these files in the catalog at all. If they were kept somewhere else, that would be fine, but if they were lost, wouldn't it be serious?\"\n\n\n Fran turned pale. If someone had taken all the magic-related files, then I, who was responsible for tiding up the library, would be the prime suspect. But after all, the cabinet with the valuable books and the chained books were spared, so I didn't think the culprit was so malicious, but I would confirm it for insurance.\n\n\n \"I hate to see you so many times a day…\"\n\n\n As soon as I entered the Head Priest's Office, the Head Priest gave me a dirty look. \"I don't come here to see you either, okay?\" I retorted in my heart, but thanked him with a smile on my face.\n\n\n \"Head Priest, thank you very much for the catalogue you lent me.\"\n\n\n \"You're done already? Faster than I thought.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest muttered. Of course! Such valuable files could not be left unattended."

However, I have not seen these files, and if you have kept them separately, it does not matter. But if they are lost or stolen, it may be a serious problem, which is why I am reporting to you.\"\n\n\n \"They're in my room, so you needn't worry about them… but, Maine, with all the files in the library, how did you find out they weren't there?\"\n\n\n \"Because I've been waiting for them to appear in order to code them, and I haven't seen them at all.\"\n\n\n Those were the real magic-related files I had never read when I was Urano. I'd been waiting for them to show up for seeing their true colours, but in the end I didn't see any. Anyone would have noticed in this situation. And although the Head Priest said the library was full of files, it didn't feel like many to me with Urano's memory.\n\n\n \"What do you mean by 'code them'?\"\n\n\n \"Means to code a file using Maine Decimal Classification.\"\n\n\n I took out my writing board with the classification I had written for Fran.\n\n\n \"I don't know anything about magic, so I'm worried about whether to classify it as science or technology. I planned to read the files before I made a decision.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, interesting. Did you come up with it?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest looked at me with suspicion. That suspicion was quite right, because I couldn't have come up with something so great.\n\n\n \"No, it's based on Melvil Dewey's Dewey Decimal Classification. It's been drastically changed to the Nippon Decimal Classification, and I changed it to the Maine Decimal Classification.\"\n\n\n \"Melvil Dewey? Who is he? I've never heard of him.\"\n\n\n \"He's passed away, and I haven't seen him in person. Anyway, what would you classify magic into?\"\n\n\n I pointed to the writing board and consulted with the Head Priest about the classification codes for magic. To my surprise, the Head Priest actually thought seriously: \"If it's basic magic… no, but if it's a magic tool…\" I waited excitedly for his answer, but he cleared his throat and shook his head as if suddenly remembering something.\n\n\n \"You have to read the files to be sure, but you don't have to worry about it.\"\n\n\n \"Why? If you don't make a code, you can't sort it out.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest slowly looked around the room, then handed me an anti-eavesdropping magic tool. I held it and waited for him to speak.\n\n\n \"Magic is a field that only aristocrats can dabble in. I'm not going to put anything about magic in the library, as they can't be seen by the blue-robed priests who haven't graduated from Aristocrats Academy.\"\n\n\n In other words, the files in the secret room must all have something to do with magic. At the same time I realized this, I was also surprised, for what the Head Priest had just said seemed to imply that the blue-robed priests and priestesses were not aristocrats.\n\n\n \"You said only aristocrats can dabble in, but blue-robed priests and priestesses are also aristocrats, right?\"\n\n\n \"They are not exactly aristocrats. They are people of noble blood and magic, but only after graduating from Aristocrats Academy will aristocratic society recognize them as true members.\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But I heard before that some of the blue-robed priests and priestesses had returned to the aristocratic society.\"\n\n\n Did they go to Aristocrats Academy when they returned home? From the gray-robed priests, who had spoken of their former masters in the orphanage and workshop, I had heard that several of the blue-robed priests and priestesses who had returned to the aristocratic society were already adults.\n\n\n \"After the coup, the number of aristocrats dropped sharply. In order to maintain the stability of the aristocracy, they were allowed to enter the Aristocrats Academy. However, the premise that only those who graduated from the Aristocrats Academy would be recognized by the aristocratic society did not break down. Even if they did not enter the Aristocrats Academy, their families still hold the power, so in the eyes of the commoners, there may not be much difference between the priests, the priestesses and the aristocrats… however, there is still a clear distinction.\"\n\n\n According to the knowledge of Urano and the words and deeds of the blue-robed priests and priestesses, I mistakenly thought that people with noble blood were aristocrats. If the prerequisite for aristocracy was to graduate from the Aristocrats Academy, none of the blue-robed priests and priestesses in the temple were considered aristocrats.\n\n\n \"… I didn't expect the aristocratic society to be so strict.\"\n\n\n \"Magic is very powerful, and if you don't know how to control and use it, or how to make a magic tool, you can't get a noble title. So, no matter how you plead with me, I can't show you the files. That's all.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest gave me a special warning at the end. He seemed to have discovered from the very beginning that my greatest ambition was to read the magic-related files.\n\n\n \"Head Priest…\"\n\n\n \"No means no. Hurry to your room.\"\n\n\n I left the Head Priest’s Office demoralized under the icy eyes of the Head Priest.\n\n\n … Humph, I just couldn't restrain my curiosity. The Head Priest was really annoying.\n\n\n Probably the work of the workshop was finished, so when I returned to the Dean's Office, I found Turi and Lutz waiting for me in the small living room on the first floor.\n\n\n \"Turi, Lutz, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.\"\n\n\n I sat in the chair in the small living room with them. As Delia made her way to the kitchen to make tea, I turned to them and asked, \"Are the books finished?\"\n\n\n \"The children in the orphanage were doing needlework for the first time, so the work is only half done now.\"\n\n\n Lutz said, and Turi nodded in a hurry.\n\n\n \"Yes. It surprised me that everyone was holding a needle for the first time… since they haven't sewed before, and they don't have any sewing tools, they can't mend their own clothes even if they are torn. Why don't we teach them how to sew as well as cook?\"\n\n\n The children worked in cheap old clothes, so I often saw holes in their clothes. But unlike the children of the commoners, the orphans did not know how to sew, and my skills were not good enough to teach, so I intended to use the old clothes as rags when they were worn out, and to buy another batch for the orphans.\n\n\n \"I can get sewing tools if you want to teach them. I can't even do things myself here, and I'm not good at it…\"\n\n\n \"Indeed, if you were to teach them, they would never improve. At least they should learn the rudiments of needlework. Please help them with the tools.\"\n\n\n The orphans didn’t even have the most basic life skills, which made Turi hard to believe. Her face was full of worries, just like when I asked her to teach orphans to cook.\n\n\n \"Thanks to you and Ella, the children in the orphanage can cook soup now. This time, you will also serve as a sewing teacher.\"\n\n\n \"It is better to learn more than to know nothing.\"\n\n\n When I jokingly called her teacher, Turi pouted but immediately dropped her head.\n\n\n \"… but all the children in the orphanage can read, can't they? When I was instructing the bookbinding just now, I noticed that they could read a lot. It's a blow to me that so young a child can read.\"\n\n\n \"Because they usually play Carta. You can play together next time.\"\n\n\n Carta seemed to have made a great contribution to the study of words. The Children's Edition of the Scripture also included all the words that appeared on the Carta, so the children in the orphanage quickly became familiar with the content. But, for those who lived outside the temple, I thought it was hard to read right away. I wanted to show Benno the Scripture first and see how he would react.\n\n\n \"Lutz, are you ready for Mr. Benno's book?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, we have finished the books for those who usually look after us, and I have them with me.\"\n\n\n With a look of pride, Lutz pulled out four books that had already been bound.\n\n\n \"Oh, thank you! Take one to Mr. Benno tomorrow!\"\n\n\n \"No problem!\"\n\n\n Even if we go unannounced, we usually got to see Benno, or we could ask Mark to deliver the book. However, if I wanted to send the book to the Head Priest, I must start by writing a letter requesting a meeting.\n\n\n \"… do we have to write a letter every time? Aristocrats are troublesome.\"\n\n\n \"Master Maine, will you ask Rosina to write for you?\"\n\n\n Although it was a question, Fran's expression and tone were full of the intention of \"I want to test her competence\". Writing letters for me was an attendant’s work, so it would be an excellent exercise for Rosina to write to the Head Priest. If she made some mistakes, the Head Priest would send the letter back after correcting it.\n\n\n \"All right. Let Rosina try it.\"\n\n\n Rosina shuddered, but then, with a graceful smile, she accepted the task. \"I really must learn from Rosina.\" As I was thinking, I found Delia staring at Rosina, as if she envied her so much for her new work. Gil had been in charge of the workshop and whenever I wanted to make a new product, he had new work. Fran's work was to vary from day to day according to my situation. Rosina was not good at calculation or writing, but she could do it, so she was bound to be assigned Fran’s work, and her work grew. Only Delia, still in the Dean's Office, would feel like she was standing still.\n\n\n …Although she is also very serious in the study of writing and calculation.\n\n\n Gil must have learned faster because the children in the orphanage were competitors. I had tried so hard, but I could not feel the progress -- I understood Delia's anxiety. Because I often felt like I wasn't making any progress and was left behind by Lutz, who was my age.\n\n\n Did I praise Delia too little?\n\n\n Gil would report the results to me succinctly and ask for praise, so it was easy for me to give it to him. But Delia always did her work as a matter of course, so it was hard for me to praise her.\n\n\n \"Delia, this book is for the Head Priest. Put it in my desk drawer.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, at your service.\"\n\n\n When she took it, I placed another one in her hand.\n\n\n \"Will you put this one in the little parlour for me? I hope you will be the first to read it, and let me know what you think of it when you have finished.\"\n\n\n \"… you want me to be the first one to read it?\"\n\n\n Delia blinked, and I nodded to her.\n\n\n \"Yes. Gil is tied up in the workshop, and the Dean's Office can't be kept clean without you. So I want you to be the first one to read it.\"\n\n\n \"That… that’s right, I also have the credit!\"\n\n\n Delia threw up her chin, clasped the book to her bosom, and hurried up to the second floor. Seeing her happy face, everyone smiled softly."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n I was going to the Gilberta Company today, so I had to put on my apprentice's uniform. But not only the uniform, but all the decent clothes I had were thin, long-sleeved ones that were a bit cold to wear at this time of year. Lately I'd been wearing the hooded cloak that Benno gave me last winter, but I couldn't wear it forever.\n\n\n \"Looks like it's time to buy winter clothes.\"\n\n\n \"Winter clothes for going north?\"\n\n\n Turi asked, and I nodded. When I stayed at home these days, I usually lied in bed, so I didn't really get a chance to wear casual clothes. But every time I went out, it was mostly to the temple and the Gilberta Company, so I needed to buy winter clothes suitable for the north side of the city.\n\n\n \"When you go to the thrift store, remember to ask me to go with you. I'm sure to win this time!\"\n\n\n I remembered the last time Turi and Lutz were in a tie. After that, Turi became an avid dress-watcher, wandering the city on her days off to see what others were wearing.\n\n\n \"Turi, let me tell you something. I am going to deliver a book to Mr. Benno today. I planned to go directly to buy clothes after that …\"\n\n\n \"Huh? But I have to work today!\"\n\n\n Because yesterday was a day off, Turi was able to go to the workshop to help with the binding. She had to work every other day, so it's out of the question for her to go shopping today. She glared at me with resentful eyes, and I chuckled as I put the picture book in my favorite tote bag.\n\n\n \"I've changed my mind, so don't look that way. I have winter clothes for the attendants to buy, so we'll go when we're both off. Now that you're going to the orphanage to take sewing lessons, you should have something to wear to the north.\"\n\n\n \"Will you buy my share too?!\"\n\n\n Not only did she teach the children how to cook, she helped me take them to the woods, and now she's going to teach them how to sew. She really helped me a lot for the orphanage, but I never paid her a salary. Lutz was like someone from the Gilberta Company, so I usually paid him a little more, and every time I developed a new product, I split the revenue with him. It was time for me to get something for Turi, too.\n\n\n \"Think of it as a teacher's salary.\"\n\n\n \"… I didn't teach anything great. That's too much for me.\"\n\n\n Turi pursed her lips, but her cheeks flushed with pleasure. She was happy, and it was wonderful. I would gladly give her my purse!\n\n\n \"Maine, let's go.\"\n\n\n Lutz came to pick me up, so I took my bag and went outside. A cold wind blew on me and I felt that winter was really coming.\n\n\n \"Good morning, Lutz… Oh, are you wearing that, too?\"\n\n\n Lutz was wearing a hooded cloak of the same design but in a different color than mine. He said earlier that it was too tight to wear because he had grown taller over the past year. It seemed that he could not resist the cold after all.\n\n\n \"Turi and I were just talking about getting some winter clothes together on our next day off.\"\n\n\n \"It's really time.\"\n\n\n Lutz looked down at the ill-fitting cloak and sighed.\n\n\n By the way, I had also grown a little taller, and the overlength cloak now fitted me well. Perhaps it had something to do with the fact that I had been so devoted to render my magic and had seldom been ill by eclipse. Although my body was still weak, the number of times I fell ill decreased, and the number of times I could eat normally increased accordingly. Besides, the food in the temple was as luxurious as that at the aristocratic table, so I finally improved a little in height.\n\n\n Fire god Lydenscheft, who was in charge of growth, thank you!\n\n\n \"Pray to the gods!\"\n\n\n \"What are you doing?!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm used to it…\"\n\n\n Before I knew it, I had adapted myself to the habits of the temple. I was able, on the spur of the moment, to perform a strange prayer in the street, which attracted the attention of passers-by. I hung my head in embarrassment and walked with Lutz to the Gilberta Company.\n\n\n \"Mr. Mark, I have something to show to Mr. Benno. Is he here?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, he is in the office. Wait a moment.\"\n\n\n After Mark informed Benno, Lutz and I walked into the office. Benno was sitting at his desk busily writing.\n\n\n \"Good morning, Mr. Benno.\"\n\n\n I waited until he put down his pen before greeting him. He answered me, stretched hard, and then turned his eyes to Lutz.\n\n\n \"Yes, Master.\"\n\n\n Perhaps understanding the meaning of his gaze, Lutz asked me to sit down and disappeared behind the door that led to the second floor.\n\n\n \"Mr. Benno, what is Lutz going to do?\"\n\n\n \"Well, I asked him to tell the servants to prepare the tea.\"\n\n\n He said as if it was a matter of course, but this was the first time I saw Lutz going upstairs from that door.\n\n\n \"Is he free to go up to the second floor?\"\n\n\n \"He is Dupari, isn't he? As he is still a minor, I take care of his lunch, and he still lives with his parents, but when he comes of age he will live in my house, like Mark, and I will manage his life.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, I see…\"\n\n\n Since I didn't become a merchant apprentice, I didn't know the difference between Dulua and Dulpari, but I thought it's similar to the difference between a contract employee and a reserve cadre.\n\n\n \"I wonder whether it is better to say you are different or lack common sense.\" Benno sighed.\n\n\n At that moment Lutz came back, hesitating whether to stand behind Benno or sit next to me.\n\n\n \"Lutz, you and I did it together. Sit here this time!\"\n\n\n I patted a nearby chair and called him to sit down. Benno nodded in agreement. So he smiled and sat down next to me.\n\n\n \"Well, what do you want me to see?\"\n\n\n \"Tada! That's it! The Children's Edition of the Scripture.\"\n\n\n \"So you guys were serious about this?\"\n\n\n Mumbling in disbelief, Benno took the picture book I handed him. He glanced at the cover and back, then squinted at the binding stitch.\n\n\n \"Is this book held by thread alone? No paste?\"\n\n\n \"Gelatin isn't finished yet. I've considered making paste from starch, but not only would it cost more, but the children at the orphanage were against it because they thought it was a waste of flour, so I gave up.\"\n\n\n The children said they would rather eat the flour than make paste. And I had seen them go hungry and reluctant to use flour to make paste. Benno paused for a moment, stroking the flowers on the cover.\n\n\n \"But a cover other than leather is a rarity. Is this the same paper you sent me before?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. If I could paint it, I could make it prettier. I've also thought about making dye out of fruit, but the children always put food first.\"\n\n\n Children were working to feed themselves, so the food in front of them must be more important than the illusory pursuit. I would have to try to make dyes out of inedible materials in the future.\n\n\n \"What could be made of black and white alone?\"\n\n\n Benno said as he opened the cover, and the first thing that caught his eye was an illustration of Wilma. At the moment he saw the illustration, his eyes widened, and he seemed to be deeply attracted.\n\n\n \"… it's amazing. What's this?\"\n\n\n \"You can get an illustration like this by applying pigments through a hollow-out onto another sheet of paper. It's called silhouette picture and it's a new way of drawing. Wilma did a lot of work on it. Isn't it beautiful?\"\n\n\n I puffed out my chest to show how capable my attendant was, but Benno hugged his head as if he had heard something vexing.\n\n\n \"A new way of drawing… you've taken on so many new things without saying a word again.\"\n\n\n \"Oh dear, Mr. Benno, don't be so troubled. A book made of paper is something that no one has ever seen, so don't bother about an illustration.\"\n\n\n There were books made of parchment, but this was the first attempt to make books out of paper. Now it was just a new way of drawing, I would not take any complaints about that.\n\n\n \"How dare you ask me not to bother? You…\"\n\n\n \"This is the first picture book in the world for children. On paper that has recently invented, we've done illustrations in a new way with pigments that have never been used before, and we've also used new printing and binding techniques. Frankly, none of them are known.\"\n\n\n Benno stared at the picture book as if he was looking at something horrible, and then he scratched his head.\n\n\n \"You make my head ache… So, what's the price?\"\n\n\n \"If we just calculate the cost, the picture book is worth about one small gold coin and five big silver coins. But the more picture books we make, the more the initial investment can be spread out, so the final price should be around eight big silver coins.\"\n\n\n We collected the soot to make the pigments this time. If we had to make the soot manually, the cost would be increased. We also made our own paper, and we didn't have to pay any commission to Benno. The current price includes only initial investment, raw materials and labor, so I was not exaggerating the value of this book.\n\n\n \"Oh…\"\n\n\n \"As paper becomes more widely available, its price will fall, and so should the price of books. As for the pigments… If linseed oil is always expensive, there's nothing I can do about it. It's really not cheap.\"\n\n\n Benno shook his head at my words.\n\n\n \"It's cheap compared to the four or five big gold coins that an aristocrat would normally spend on a book. It's even too cheap. It's also very suitable for children.\"\n\n\n \"If you want it to look luxurious, we can change the cover to leather. It's just that I value the beautiful illustrations on the inside more than the elegant covers on the outside.\"\n\n\n Without the privileged conditions of the aristocrats, commoners could not afford a single book. However, if it could be bought for an inexpensive price, someone should want to buy it as a status symbol. For the vain plutocrats, if we make the cover a little more ornate, they would surely fall for it.\n\n\n \"Yeah, some of the rich might be willing to pay… Do you have any other books planned?\""

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"I would like to make more picture books like this. I want the articles to be as short as possible because engraving takes a lot of time. Also, my illustrator is limited in what she can draw. She is a girl who has never set foot outside the temple or seen the outside world, so she can't draw anything everyday.\"\n\n\n Wilma was grown a lot since she learned to make soup, but she still couldn't recognize the ingredients. The orphanage was also short of supplies, as was evident from its lack of sewing tools, knives and baskets for the forest.\n\n\n \"This is… extreme.\"\n\n\n \"It's due to living conditions and there's nothing we can do about it. So it would be better for Vilma to draw what she is good at. Myths fit her well, and there are plenty of them anyway.\"\n\n\n \"But if all books are about myths…\"\n\n\n \"It would be boring. I know that.\"\n\n\n I said with a wry smile. While myth was approachable and interesting to the children in the orphanage, it was completely unpopular in the city.\n\n\n \"If I were to make a text-only book without the illustrations of Wilma, then there is something I would like to do for efficiency and productivity.\"\n\n\n \"What is it?\"\n\n\n \"Wax paper. First of all, we have to make paper that is even and thin to the point of transparency, and then we have to mix wax and pine resin to spread it thinly across the paper. Frankly, both of these jobs require the skill of a craftsman, and there's no machine… I don't think we can succeed without asking the wax shop for help.\"\n\n\n To be honest, it would not be easy. I was afraid that we would make a lot of failed paper, plus the proportion of wax was not easy to grasp, if not to succeed, we would be exhausted in the end. However, once the wax paper was made, engraving would be as simple as writing, which would save a lot of effort.\n\n\n \"Wax? Don't think about it at this time of year, the workshop is too busy.\"\n\n\n \"I agree. Another is movable type. I am now considering whether to make wax paper or movable type.\"\n\n\n \"What's your problem?\"\n\n\n Benno tilted his head wonderingly, and Lutz did the same.\n\n\n \"I don't think it would be difficult to make movable type, so long as Johann from the forge could be commissioned. But it is a heavy labour equivalent to operating a compressor, and the children would certainly not be able to do it.\"\n\n\n In English, the journal is also called press, because it has to be pressed when it is printed. If I wanted to introduce movable type here, I had to make sure the staff were strong enough.\n\n\n \"It's not easy to make wax paper, but once it's made, even children can do the printing. That's the advantage of stencil duplicating.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it's really hard to choose.\"\n\n\n Benno and Lutz folded their arms and lost in thought.\n\n\n \"But I'll have to save up for whatever I want to make. We've invested so much in these picture books. I won't get any income from them because I'm going to use them as textbooks for the orphans…\"\n\n\n \"What?! Don't you sell them?! Maine, what are you thinking?!\"\n\n\n If the handiwork the orphanage had made for the winter sell well, it will make up for it -- just as I was thinking this, Benno gave a sudden snarl that made my shoulders shake.\n\n\n \"What are you talking about, Mr. Benno? Textbooks are not for sale.\"\n\n\n \"How can you make something for nothing?! If you can sell them, sell them!\"\n\n\n \"No! These picture books can only be used as textbooks! Improving literacy is a great initial investment as well! This will open up future markets!\"\n\n\n I'd decided to experiment at the orphanage this winter to see if I could set up a temple classroom. I definitely wouldn't sell textbooks. I even wanted to stock up on writing boards and calculators. I tried to make myself understood to Benno, but he shook his head wearily.\n\n\n \"I can't understand what you're thinking. Totally.\"\n\n\n \"We don't know yet how popular this picture book will be in the city, because so far everyone has only heard myths in the temple, which have not penetrated into daily life. It would be better to make new picture books that are more popular with people in the city and sell them as merchandise.\"\n\n\n Rather than lose my textbooks, I would make some new picture books that might sell better.\n\n\n \"You mean new picture books?\"\n\n\n \"Are you already thinking of new stories?\"\n\n\n Benno and Lutz looked surprised. But I didn't need to think too much. There were a lot of stories in stock that could be made into picture books. Just for the sake of Wilma, their numbers would be drastically reduced.\n\n\n \"If it's a fairy tale about a princess, I think Wilma would be able to draw it. After all, she has served a noble daughter. I'm going to write the outline first and ask the Head Priest to read it before I make it into a picture book.\"\n\n\n I thought a picture book based on Cinderella should work. Let Vilma draw the princess from the model of Miss Christine, and the figure would be at least eighty percent like. As for the prince's image, Wilma should be able to figure out how to draw it, as the attendants had been to the aristocratic quarter with their masters at the Star Festival.\n\n\n \"All right, it's up to you anyway. Then how much shall I pay for this picture book?\"\n\n\n \"It's a gift book to say thank you to the people who have taken care of us so far, so you don't have to pay…\"\n\n\n I stammered, and Benno laughed.\n\n\n \"What do you want from me this time?\"\n\n\n \"I want to buy winter clothes with Turi the next time she takes a break. Please take us to the thrift store.\"\n\n\n \"Okay, no problem. One of Mark and I will go with you anyway. What else?\"\n\n\n At Benno's urging, I took out my writing board.\n\n\n \"I think salt and spices are needed for the pork processing in the orphanage. What and how much should I prepare? I was sick in bed every time pork was processed, so I have no idea what to do. It's also the orphanage's first attempt, so the tools have to be ready, too.\"\n\n\n \"It'll cost a lot of money. Is that ok?\"\n\n\n Benno looked sharply at me, and I looked back into his auburn eyes and gave him a strong nod.\n\n\n \"I have made up my mind that all the money I earned from Tronbay-paper will be spent.\"\n\n\n The purpose of the workshop was to enable the children in the orphanage to live independently. It was only natural that the money earned by the hard work of the orphans should be used in the orphanage.\n\n\n \"Okay, I'll get everything ready for you. But instead, I'll use your manpower, because we're understaffed.\"\n\n\n \"I see. And how is my ceremonial dress coming along?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Corinna said she wanted you to try it on.\"\n\n\n As soon as I had finished my last question, Benno went to his desk and rang the bell for the maid to ask if Corinna was at home.\n\n\n \"Go to Corinna's today, if you have time.\"\n\n\n The maid returned upstairs after asking me to wait a moment.\n\n\n \"Please go on with your work, Mr. Benno. My business is done.\"\n\n\n It was now time to prepare for winter, and as the owner of a large store, Mr. Benno was very busy. I couldn't bother him too much, so Lutz and I discussed the Cinderella story and worked on the new picture book while we waited.\n\n\n A moment later, a bell rang somewhere. Benno looked up and said, \"Lutz, take Maine to Corinna.\" Then he bowed his head again.\n\n\n I followed Lutz up the stairs from the back door to Corinna 's place.\n\n\n \"Mrs. Corinna, it is Lutz. I have brought Maine.\" \n\n \"Welcome, Maine. Go and rest yourself, Lutz.\"\n\n\n Unlike in the past, Corinna now wore loose clothes that did not tie up at the waist. Her belly seemed to be getting a little bigger, probably because of her clothes. Great, she and her baby were fine.\n\n\n \"Look, the embroidery is beautiful, isn't it?\"\n\n\n The blue cloth in front of me was decorated with shimmering patterns of water ripples and exquisite embroidered flowers, and Corinna had already made marks for cutting. I looked closely and found that those flowers belong to different seasons, but now they were all blooming gracefully on this cloth.\n\n\n \"How beautiful…\"\n\n\n \"Maine, this is a sample dress for you. Try it on. I want to check the size.\"\n\n\n I followed Corinna's advice and put on the sample made of other cloth. Because she had measured me before, the dress fit almost perfectly. If she made me a ceremonial dress of this size, it would soon be too small to wear.\n\n\n …See, I did grow taller.\n\n\n \"Mrs. Corinna, please don't cut it exactly to my present size. You can hide some extra cloth in the seams or make pleats. In this way, when I grow up, I can modify this dress and continue to wear it.\"\n\n\n I pinched the cloth at the waist and folded it inward, but Corinna turned her head in confusion.\n\n\n \"Like your baptism dress? But the ceremonial dress does not need to have extra pleats, does it? \"\n\n\n \"At that time, we just changed Turi's old clothes to my size, but the method is very similar. Because once the cloth is cut, it can't be lengthened. I don't want to add pleats to the dress, but to fold the cloth in like this at the waist, shoulders and cuffs.\"\n\n\n I explained to Corinna, but she was even more puzzled.\n\n\n \"But if it doesn’t fit anymore, why don't you order a new one? Every season is different, and the clothes need to fit so they look great.\"\n\n\n In Japan, when making children's kimonos, people always hide some extra cloth around the waist and shoulders for the growth of children. However, the custom here was to sell clothes and buy new ones when they outgrow them, which annoyed me.\n\n\n \"But that's an aristocratic way of life, right? I can't order such expensive clothes all the time.\"\n\n\n It happened that Benno had given me the cloth, so I had only to pay for the dye and the workmanship to order it. If I started with cloth, the price would be more than twice as high. I didn't have the money to order this kind of ceremonial dress with high quality cloth many times.\n\n\n \"… you are right. My values have been distorted by the aristocratic clothes I see every day. I've forgotten you're not an aristocrat.\"\n\n\n \"And there's probably no fashion for a simple ceremonial dress, so please focus on how long I can wear it.\"\n\n\n Corinna nodded, as if she understood.\n\n\n \"Maine, can you tell me what you know? How can I do this without compromising the beauty of the dress?\"\n\n\n So Corinna and I had a long discussion about how much cloth to hide and how to sew. Then my fitting was over.\n\n\n … Ah! Would Turi cry if I told her the fitting was over?"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n When I got to the Dean's Office in the temple, I had to change into my blue robe, but I couldn't do it myself. Dalia would growl at me angrily if I changed on my own. Whether I bend or straighten my arm, I had to match her movements. At the beginning we had no understanding. Changing clothes was like a fight, which made me think I'd better do it myself. But now I was naturally in her service. \"I am a little like a noble daughter.\" I thought as I waited for her to comb my hair, but she was distracted, and then suddenly murmured,\n\n\n \"It's better than I thought.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n She said it so suddenly that I really didn't know what it meant. At my question, Dalia's pale blue eyes widened as if offended.\n\n\n \"I mean the picture book you want me to be the first to read! Didn't you say you wanted to hear my thoughts?\"\n\n\n \"Ah, so that's what you said. I just didn't get what you were saying. I'm glad you're willing to share your thoughts. Have you read the whole book? You seem to have picked up a lot of words.\"\n\n\n Dalia had been studying alone and at a slower pace than Gil. To be honest, I didn't expect her to finish it so soon.\n\n\n \"… I asked Gil to teach me some words and how to play Karuta.\"\n\n\n She had always regarded Gil as a competitor, and now she asked him to teach her to read. I couldn't help but smile at the thought of the scene. As I smirked, Rosina cut us off with a serious expression.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, there is no time for you to chat now. Please hurry up and practice the fespiel.\"\n\n\n \"What's the matter, Rosina? You look nervous.\"\n\n\n \"I have received a letter from the Head Priest, in which he asks you to perform the second etude at your meeting.\"\n\n\n When I heard Rosina say that, I understood immediately. No wonder she was so nervous. Anyone would be nervous at such news.\n\n\n \"Well, I'll have to practice. When did he specify?\"\n\n\n \"After lunch.\"\n\n\n Rosina's answer skipped the date, and with an ominous foreboding, I asked slowly:\n\n\n \"… Which day's lunch, Rosina?\"\n\n\n \"Today's.\"\n\n\n Fran told Rosina that the Head Priest had to go to the Harvest Festival in a nearby village and would not be back for a long time, so he wanted to meet me before he left. While I was glad he was willing to take care of my affairs as soon as possible, his request was too much of a surprise.\n\n\n \"Grace, Master Maine, is in deliberation. Be careful not to betray your inner confusion to the Head Priest.\"\n\n\n I practiced ferociously until the third bell, then calmly assisted the Head Priest with his duties until the fourth bell, just like I didn't think performing in front of him was a big deal. During my stay in the Head Priest's Office, I had been quietly testifying to him that I was methodical in spite of his sudden request on me to perform. I then had a frantic lunch and practiced until the last second of my break. I wish someone would compliment me on my efforts behind the scenes.\n\n\n I'd improved since I was forced to practice more, but I was still nervous about performing in front of the Head Priest. In particular, I was going to perform an original piece -- although I claim it was original, it was actually a song I learned in my last life.\n\n\n I gave up the love songs in the movie for the regular school songs. The lyrics of love songs were difficult to translate or adapt, so I sang them differently every time, and sometimes I slipped out of English, which made Rosina worry a lot.\n\n\n \"It will be all right if you keep calm, for you are a better player than I am.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you, Dalia. I'll try.\"\n\n\n Encouraged by Dalia, my confidence soared. I went with Fran and Rosina to the Head Priest's Office. The children's Edition of the Scripture and the first draft of Cinderella were held by Fran, while the fespiel was held by Rosina.\n\n\n \"Sorry to be so sudden. Let me hear how much you've improved since then.\"\n\n\n I could not hear any apology in the Head Priest's voice. Sitting in a chair in the middle of the room, I took the fespiel from Rosina, positioned myself, and took a deep breath.\n\n\n From deep inside my ears came the sound of pounding heart. I plucked the strings and performed an etude and a school song one after another. When I performed the school song, I didn't use the chestnut in the lyrics, but changed it to a local nut so that it didn't sound out of place. The Head Priest nodded with satisfaction, praising my performance as \"very good\".\n\n\n \"You are making great progress. Here is an etude for you to play next time. Also, the song you wrote is very interesting. Try to write a new one next time.\"\n\n\n I looked at the score handed to me by the Head Priest and found that the next etude was a little difficult. I couldn't help but feel exhausted, but also relieved that I had made it through.\n\n\n \"Rosina, hold this for me, please.\"\n\n\n I handed Rosina the fespiel and reached for Arnaud's tea. After the trial, I felt that the tea tasted especially good today. The Head Priest, on the contrary, had been listening to me while drinking his tea, and was putting his teacups back on the table.\n\n\n \"So you asked for a meeting because the Children's Edition of the Scripture was ready?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. Here it is.\"\n\n\n I looked at Fran. Fran bowed his head and quickly handed the picture book to the Head Priest. The Head Priest stared at it and tapped his temple with his fingertips.\n\n\n \"You call it a book? What's with this cover?\"\n\n\n Unlike in the secret room, his expression barely changed, making it difficult for me to read his emotions, but there was a clear note of reproach in his voice. Why did he make such a shrill voice just because he saw the cover?\n\n\n \"It's just paper. Why?\"\n\n\n \"I know that. What I want to ask is why there are flowers in the paper?\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Because we put flowers in it.\"\n\n\n \"I know that too. I mean, why did you put flowers in it?\"\n\n\n The more impatient the Head Priest became, and the more severe his tone became, for there was no answer he wanted to hear; but I had no idea why his mood had suddenly taken such a turn. When Seeing this cover, Benno was very happy and thought that it would be very popular among the noble daughters. Did the aristocrats forbid flowers in the paper?\n\n\n \"Er… because I think it's cute. What's wrong with that?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest shook his head as if unable to understand me. He got up and went to the secret room at the back. I couldn't understand his reaction either, so I followed him to my feet.\n\n\n \"Don't forget this, Master Maine.\"\n\n\n Fran hurried over to me the paper on which the Cinderella was written. After Thanking him, I went through the door the Head Priest opened.\n\n\n Stepping into the permanently cluttered secret room, I walked to my usual bench. I was about to push away the files that occupied the bench when it occurred to me that they might be those related to magic.\n\n\n \"Maine, I said you couldn't.\"\n\n\n Before I could peek, the Head Priest, who had detected my intention, took the file from my hand and placed it on the table. The files on that desk must be all about magic. I thought about this and looked around the room, and it struck me that the room looked different. It was amazing. The Head Priest drew up his chair and frowned.\n\n\n \"Don't look around.\"\n\n\n \"I beg your pardon… what would you like to ask?\"\n\n\n \"I'm asking you, how on earth do you have to make paper with flowers in it? I wouldn't force you to answer, if it's a feat of the workshop, but it's very unusual to have flowers in the paper, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Unusual? You add petals to the materials and you make the paper like this.\"\n\n\n \"… Add petals?\"\n\n\n I moved my finger and made the motion of sprinkling the petals into the papermaking machine, but the Head Priest didn't seem to understand. It occurred to me that the only \"paper\" he had ever seen was basically parchment. If he only knew how to make parchment, he really couldn't understand how to make flower-paper.\n\n\n \"Well… Plant-paper is made in a completely different way from parchment, so if you're curious, please visit the workshop sometime.\"\n\n\n \"All right. I don't understand your instructions at all.\"\n\n\n Presumably giving up the answer he wanted to hear, the Head Priest crossed his feet and placed the picture book in his lap.\n\n\n When he opened the title page and saw the articles and the illustrations, he looked disgusted at once.\n\n\n \"A book is a work of art. It should be covered in leather, decorated with precious stones and gold, and painted in lots of colour. The whole book should be bright and beautiful. From an artistic point of view, this book is of little value. The illustrations are so good that they should have been coloured. What a waste.\"\n\n\n Let the calligrapher write, let the painter draw, and let the craftsman make the cover, so as to make the book in his mind. I had only to think back to the books in the library to see what he is thinking at once."

This picture book was designed to teach the orphans how to read, and I would rather have more books for them than spend a lot of money on one.\"\n\n\n \"Books are works of art, unique treasures, so what are you talking about?\"\n\n\n \"What are you talking about?\" I wanted to give it back to him as it was. I couldn't help but blurt out:\n\n\n \"Then what are you talking about? Books are not works of art. They are the fruit of knowledge and wisdom. I don't want to make art but books that everyone can read. For me, the cheaper the better. It would be even better if books could be mass-produced.\"\n\n\n \"Mass-produce? Are you going to get a bunch of people to copy articles? If orphans could all write, this might be possible, but who knows how many years it will take.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest pressed his temple, as if desperately pondering some mystery of the world. However, I'd been thinking about alternatives since the beginning, so I'd never considered such an approach that would take years.\n\n\n \"No, I will mass-produce them in print. There are already thirty copies of the same picture book…\"\n\n\n \"Wait.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest raised his eyebrows, then interrupted me. His pale gold eyes were filled with disbelief.\n\n\n \"What do you mean there are already thirty copies of the same picture book…?\"\n\n\n \"That means we printed thirty copies.\"\n\n\n \"Printed?\"\n\n\n He clearly had no idea what the workshop was about, and I didn't know if this was due to his negligence or Fran's unfamiliarity with the workshop. I had to report to him on time the revenue of the workshop, and I didn't miss a single contribution to the temple, so I thought Fran would tell him, but it didn't seem so.\n\n\n I was really in a dilemma as to where to begin to answer such a question.\n\n\n \"Did you know that Maine Workshop makes plant-paper?\"\n\n\n \"I know that.\"\n\n\n \"Later, we made thicker paper on which words and pictures were engraved. The engraving tool is called a penknife -- a very small knife -- so that we got the template.\"\n\n\n \"Engraved on paper?\"\n\n\n The voice of the Head Priest sharpened, and I found myself saying something very contrary to common sense again. But it was too late. I'd better pretend nothing happened.\n\n\n \"Put the template on the paper, and the pigment can stay on the paper through the hollowed-out part. After that, replace with another paper and repeat the previous step. In this way, we can easily get the same two pieces of paper. After repeating this step thirty times for each page, we will get thirty books.\"\n\n\n From halfway through, the Head Priest was as unresponsive as a crashed computer. \"Head Priest, can you hear me?\" I asked, waving my hand in front of his eyes.\n\n\n \"Yes. Although I can hear…\"\n\n\n He restarted but closed his eyes and sighed. Even Benno didn't react like that, so I was horrified.\n\n\n \"… are you all right, Head Priest?\"\n\n\n \"… I can't believe you did such a bold thing.\"\n\n\n What was bold? I thought back to the process of making picture books. The boldest was that I decisively gave up prints to develop templates. But that's not what the Head Priest was supposed to be referring to. While I was deep in thought, he sighed again.\n\n\n \"In other words, printing is engraving paper and painting, right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, it is now.\"\n\n\n \"In general, no one would think of engraving paper, and the idea of painting it at any cost is incredible.\"\n\n\n Parchment was expensive and rare, so engraving it was a waste for anyone. Although the price of plant-paper was not low, I didn't think it was wasteful because I could make my own paper in The Maine Workshop and I knew about print.\n\n\n I did not want the same thing as the Head Priest do. To go on with this would only lead to an inconclusive argument. But I thought it was better to spend money on the print than on the cover. After all, a glossy cover was only the appearance. The value of a book should be reflected in its content.\n\n\n \"I can't believe someone would go to great lengths to decorate the cover. Plus, I'm using soot collected by the gray-robed priests to make the pigment, so the cost is lower…\"\n\n\n \"Can you really make pigment out of soot?\"\n\n\n He had questioned me when I was collecting soot, but I had explained to him that it was to make pigment, and it seemed that he did not expect me to actually make it. I was surprised by his shocked expression.\n\n\n \"… is it so surprising to you?\"\n\n\n \"Isn't that obvious?\"\n\n\n \"Mr. Benno told me when I gave him the picture book just now that I was making his head ache. But the conversation quickly turned to costs and new picture books, so I didn't think it would be so surprising.\"\n\n\n Perhaps Benno, accustomed to dealing with me and calculating the benefits from a merchant's point of view, had succeeded in cushioned the blow, but the truth was that most people were as shocked as the Head Priest. As I pondered the difference between Benno and others, I saw the Head Priest slowly shook his head and cast his eyes out the window.\n\n\n \"…It turns out that Benno was also quite hard. If everything you do is so shocking, I can imagine that his fatigue must be extraordinary.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?! But Mr. Benno is a businessman, of course he would like to get something that sells well. Although he is very hard, he is willing to participate. This is not my responsibility. It should not be.\"\n\n\n Whether it was to set up a plant-paper association, which was in opposition to the parchment association, or to boast to Inles and started an Italian restaurant, it was Benno’s own decision. At my words, the Head Priest just shrugged, and showed a clear \"I guess so\" expression on his face.\n\n\n \"I shall have to ask Benno, not you… By the way, Maine, did you mention the new picture book?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, do you have any questions?\"\n\n\n \"Make sure you report to me before you make it. I don't want you to scare me every time.\"\n\n\n But no matter when I report, what scares you still scares you -- I grumbled to myself and handed him the paper with Cinderella on it. Since he wanted to read it, why not?\n\n\n \"Here's an outline for the next picture book. What do you think?\"\n\n\n After reading it briefly, he frowned.\n\n\n \"How can a merchant's daughter marry a prince? Are you a fool? Or do you not know what a status gap is?\"\n\n\n \"I really don't know much about the status gap. Well… What class of aristocrat can bridge it to marry a prince, and you can accept that?\"\n\n\n If the setting was so bad that I got called a fool, then I do need to compromise. Hearing my concession, the Head Priest rested his chin on his hand and pondered for a moment.\n\n\n \"… to marry a prince, the girl must be at least a superior aristocrat and a lady of strict education. There is no such thing as bridging the status gap. Instead of making her a princess, make her a concubine. Isn't that enough to be envied?\"\n\n\n \"No, no, no, I don't agree! Being a concubine is not even a dream!\"\n\n\n \"Forget the dream, face the reality.\"\n\n\n The central idea of the story was to pursue true love regardless of the status gap, so Cinderella must be a princess to meet the theme, but the Head Priest firmly opposed. Sometimes, reading was an escape and a dream, and if Cinderella ends up as a concubine, that would be too cruel for the reader.\n\n\n \"What if the hero is not a prince but a Lord of the border? Are there any examples of bridging this type of status gap? It's just a fictional anyway, can you accept that?\"\n\n\n \"Well… it depends on the size of the territory, but even if there's a bit of a gap between the two, it might be possible to sort it out. Although there will be a lot of opposition around…\"\n\n\n Even if there is a status gap, the hero and heroine still go on to a happy ending despite the opposition of all -- Such a story was very suitable for picture books. It seemed that there was a story that we can both accept, which made me feel relieved.\n\n\n \"Then I will change the hero from a prince to the son of a Lord.\"\n\n\n \"Cinderella can't be the daughter of a merchant, but of an aristocrat. And what about this fairy? How on earth does she work magic with such strange spells? Even if you don't know anything about magic, it's too far off the mark.\"\n\n\n Thus, the story of Cinderella was cut out of all the parts with the fairy under the constant ridicule of the Head Priest. The main line also turned into that a noble daughter entered the society with the help of an aristocrat related to her dead mother and fell in love with the son of the Lord at first sight after she was bullied by her stepmother. There was no longer any trace of the original Cinderella in this story, but after all, the aristocrats were the main readers of the future, so I would gratefully take the advice of the Head Priest from the aristocratic point of view.\n\n\n \"The story says they will live a happy life, but that's not going to happen.\"\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest said that after the hero and the heroine got married, the hero would be evicted from his land by his Lord father. Even if the Lord was lenient enough to agree to their marriage, the hero would lose the right to be the next Lord and could only be the help of his younger brother. I didn't want to write this part at all. After knowing the following plot that was too realistic, the picture book of Cinderella I was going to make was no longer a fairy tale to me, but a complete tragedy."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"There is one more thing I want to discuss with you, Head Priest.\"\n\n\n I arranged the paper in my lap and looked at the Head Priest. Sensing my gaze, he put back on the table behind him the files he had taken to read while I was rewriting Cinderella.\n\n\n \"It's about the winter preparations for the orphanage…\"\n\n\n \"Winter preparations? … Ah, speaking of wood and food, the temple will not let the orphans be wronged. I will let Fran report to you for details. I won't be able to give you a clear answer until the blue-robed priests return from the Harvest Festival. But there have been no abnormalities in recent weather and no large-scale plague, so there will be no change in the grace of god.\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Can you predict that?\"\n\n\n As a matter of course, we wouldn't know how this year's harvest would be until the blue-robed priests come back. Why did the Head Priest have any way of making predictions? He hardly ever left the temple. How did he do that? I blinked my eyes doubtfully. I could get some information through my family, who frequented the market, and through the well-informed Gilberta Company, but he probably had no such access.\n\n\n \"I can understand that about the weather, but how do you know if there's a plague in the villages? You've never left the city, have you?\"\n\n\n \"I have my way. I have not been to the commoners' quarter, but to the aristocratic quarter.\"\n\n\n To me, the city was the commoners' quarter where my house was, but to the Head Priest it was the aristocratic quarter. Knowing his source, I no longer had any doubts. Although this was entirely biased, I had always felt that there was a very insidious battle for information among the aristocracy.\n\n\n \"Now that you've mentioned winter preparations for the orphanage, Maine, have you been planning?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, I have asked Mr. Benno to help me with the tools and necessities. As it is the orphanage's own business, I will ask the children to help as well as the gray-robed priests.\"\n\n\n \"… do you mean young children who have not yet been baptized?\"\n\n\n He looked shocked. He was an aristocrat who did not have to do anything himself, and did not allow unbaptized children to leave the orphanage, so he never thought of making them work. But this practice made no sense in the face of poverty.\n\n\n \"It's normal in commoners' quarter, and even at a very young age, the children can help… Of course, I was sick in bed every time before, there was not much I could do.\"\n\n\n \"I think so.\"\n\n\n \"By the way, although the pork will be processed in the villages, we will be making gelatin and butter candles in the orphanage, which must have a very heavy smell when we work. Wouldn't it be a bit inappropriate if the stench is in the air because the temple is not that far from the orphanage?\"\n\n\n \"If it was from the orphanage, the blue-robed priests and priestesses may have a lot of complaints.\"\n\n\n \"… sure enough.\"\n\n\n Making gelatin and candles would give a very strong smell, so I planned to do it outside the workshop. Although the aristocratic quarter is a long way from the orphanage, the people there couldn't escape the stench. If there was really nothing we could do, we could only work in the old workshop converted from a warehouse, but it was too cramped for many people and the tools were hard to carry in, so I thought it would be better to do it in the orphanage.\n\n\n \"Normally, maybe, but it just so happens that the Harvest Festival will be held for the next ten days, and the blue-robed priests and priestesses will all be out of the temple. Even if there is some smell, it won't affect them. But after ten days, it's hard to say.\"\n\n\n However, I was not sure that pork processing would end during the Harvest Festival. We didn't even have pigs or tools ready yet. Maybe Benno could figure something out.\n\n\n \"I see. I'll discuss it with Mr. Benno.\"\n\n\n I clenched my fist and decided that I would not let go of even the slightest hope. The Head Priest plucked at his bangs and said:\n\n\n \"Maine, have you enough money to prepare so many people for winter?\"\n\n\n \"I'm spending money that orphans make for The Maine Workshop, so it's ok.\"\n\n\n \"I'm relieved you won't have to bear the full cost. But I didn't expect the orphans to be able to live on their own now.\"\n\n\n \"The grace of god is still necessary.\"\n\n\n I shrugged my shoulders at the Head Priest's exclamation. Without the grace of god, the income of the workshop would not be enough to support all the people. To be honest, Maine Workshop was a shady workshop that traded a small salary for underage labour.\n\n\n \"I thought the orphanage would have a hard winter. What you've just said is the best news for me.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest gave me a rare look of relief and expressed his approval. I smiled when I felt that my efforts for the orphanage were meaningful.\n\n\n \"As long as the preparations for the orphanage can be completed in ten days, everything will be all right. It is your preparations that I am worried about.\"\n\n\n What did he mean? By rights, I would spend the winter at home. Although I used to be a hindrance and relied on my family to make all the winter preparations, this year my mother was pregnant and I was getting taller, so I was determined to help out. But that wasn't something he had to worry about, was it?\n\n\n \"I'll be home for the winter.\"\n\n\n \"That won't do. You know there's a Dedication at the temple in the winter, don't you?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest leaned forward, his pale gold eyes looking straight at me.\n\n\n The Dedication was one of the ceremonies that Fran and the Head Priest had told me about. They had reminded me that I must attend it. It was a ceremony to pray that next spring's crops will sprout, during which all the sacred tools would be infused with magic. If it was not completed successfully, the magic bestowed on the villages during the Spring Blessing would be insufficient, affecting the harvest of the whole year.\n\n\n \"The Dedication requires a lot of magic, so you have to attend it. It must not happen that you cannot get to the temple because of a snowstorm. You have to stay at the temple all winter.\"\n\n\n \"I know that if I live at home, I will probably miss it because of the snow, but living in the temple is not realistic for me. Not only will my family worry, but I am really sick a lot in the winter…\"\n\n\n I could even say that because of this Dedication, I was given the status of a blue-robed trainee priestess, so I could understand the thinking of the Head Priest. But it was too much of a dilemma. I didn't know what my family would say.\n\n\n \"I know how your family will react to this. So if your family is worried about you, I will allow them to visit you in the Dean's Office, which is the best concession we can make. Don't neglect your own winter preparations.\"\n\n\n It was easy for him to say \"don't neglect it.\" Preparing for the winter was by no means an easy task. Although it looked like there was only one more place to prepare besides the orphanage, this was an entirely unexpected expense. Pale as death, I went out of the room.\n\n\n No, preparing my room for the winter is more trouble than the orphanage!\n\n\n \"You look rather pale, Master Maine.\"\n\n\n \"I'm fine, Rosina, I'm just a bit flustered. Fran, the Head Priest just told me I have to stay at the temple all winter.\"\n\n\n I answered Rosina's concern with a smile, then turned to Fran to discuss my winter at the temple. He nodded calmly at the decision of the Head Priest.\n\n\n \"After all, the Dedication is very important, and I'm afraid you won't be able to go home in winter.\"\n\n\n \"… I had no idea of getting ready for the winter. I don't know what I'll need.\"\n\n\n \"We've already calculated how much wood and food we'll need to keep us safe for the winter, so it won't be a problem to have one more person. Considering your daily situation, we just need a little more of everything.\"\n\n\n I heaved a sigh of relief when Fran said \"it won't be a problem\". But the extra expense was still a big headache.\n\n\n \"Rosina, could you go to the workshop and bring Lutz here?\"\n\n\n \"At your service.\"\n\n\n Back in the Dean's Office, I drank Delia's tea and continued to discuss winter preparations with Fran. I needed to identify all the things I need to prepare, including my daily necessities, materials and tools to make handiwork, and tools to pick the winter specialty \"paru\", and wrote them all on the writing board. Then I sent Fran to ask the chefs about their schedules so that I could see if anyone could stay and help with the cooking during the winter.\n\n\n After a while, Rosina and Lutz returned from the workshop.\n\n\n \"Maine, what was it you sent Rosina to me about?\"\n\n\n \"Lutz, can pork be processed in ten days? I've never been involved in it, so I have no idea.\"\n\n\n He frowned when I told him the deadline the Head Priest had asked for.\n\n\n \"Isn't that a hurry? I wonder if I can rent a smokehouse.\"\n\n\n \"I also think the time is too tight, but the Head Priest said that only during this time will the blue-robed priests and priestesses not be in the temple. If there is really no way, I plan to make gelatin in the old workshop, but it is very narrow, so it would be hard to move all the tools there, right?\"\n\n\n It must be very hard to work in a warehouse measuring only 10 square meters. Presumably imagining the scene, Lutz sniffed and groaned reluctantly.\n\n\n \"I'm going back to the Company to ask my master. He should at least send one of his men to the countryside to ask if it is possible to process pork now. You can ask Fran to take you to the Company later.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you, Lutz. I'm sorry to trouble you about this.\"\n\n\n Lutz set off for the Gilberta Company. I looked down at my writing board, thinking about how I would spend the winter.\n\n\n Even though it was only my share, the wood and food needed had increased considerably. It was months, after all, and even an extra child like me would still cost a lot.\n\n\n … Oops, money may not be enough. The picture book of Cinderella must be made quickly.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, you also need to buy some winter clothes.\"\n\n\n \"Don't worry about that, Delia. I'm thinking of doing it tomorrow. The attendants and orphans need winter clothes, too. Well… if I have to buy clothes for the orphans, why not take the attendants out shopping tomorrow?\"\n\n\n No sooner had I said this than Delia, who was obviously very interested in shopping and new clothes, cried out excitedly. Rosina, on the other hand, was a somber contrast. Rather than go out shopping, she must want to stay in the temple to play the fespiel.\n\n\n \"… the orphans will get the grace of god. If they don't have to go out, shouldn't they need clothes?\"\n\n\n So far, they had survived by the grace of god, and they really didn't need new clothes if they were going to be in the temple all the time. But when it cleared up in the winter, I would send them out to pick paru.\n\n\n \"But I will send the children to the forest some days in winter, so they will need hats and gloves.\"\n\n\n Getting the children used to the forest was not easy, and I would certainly take advantage of it. Especially since my mother was pregnant, she couldn't go to the forest this winter. I would send Turi out to the forest with the children to make sure we got the paru we need.\n\n\n … What? You called this an abuse of power? I didn't care what anyone said, I would never let go of such a precious sweet treat in winter!\n\n\n For this purpose, warm clothes, freight sledges, iron plates for making pies and shovels were needed. I wrote what I came up with one after another on my writing board. After calculating how much money these things would cost, I realized I didn't have enough money to pay for them."

Ask her who is fit to be Ella's assistant. Also, Fran, Lutz has gone to the Gilberta Company, so please take me there.\"\n\n\n \"As you wish.\"\n\n\n Rosina and Fran answered in unison. Behind me, Delia looked distraught, as if she had been waiting for us to finish our discussion. Seeing that our discussion was finally over, she began to fire off questions as she helped me change my clothes.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, where shall we shop? Will you buy my share? Shall I help you choose? How many will you buy?\"\n\n\n \"Delia, you're too excited to sleep tonight.\"\n\n\n Under her questioning, I could only smile helplessly. Her watery blue eyes sparkled and said without hesitation:\n\n\n \"How could I not be excited! This is going shopping!\"\n\n\n \"Delia, Fran is waiting. Concentrate on your work.\"\n\n\n Only when Rosina reminded her did she come to her senses and rush through my dressing.\n\n\n \"Then tomorrow let us go shopping for winter clothes. If Wilma doesn't want to go out, do not force her. Those who want to go meet at the third bell at the Gilberta Company.\"\n\n\n I followed Delia down the stairs and told her about the next day. She happily opened the door and turned to me:\n\n\n \"The third bell? As you wish, Master Maine. Take care, I look forward to your early return.\"\n\n\n Fran and I laughed when we saw how excited Delia was. We walked out the door, discussing the winter items I had listed on my writing board. There was a chill in the evening streets, and I could hear the footsteps of winter.\n\n\n \"Fran, tell Gil to bring five picture books to the Gilberta Company tomorrow.\"\n\n\n \"… at your command, but why?\"\n\n\n I had said firmly, \"I want these picture books as textbooks!\" Fran knew about it, so he asked me with a wink. Fran oversaw everything in the Dean's Office, so I'd better tell him why.\n\n\n \"Because I don't have money if I don't sell them.\"\n\n\n \"… what?\"\n\n\n \"The Head Priest asked me in such a relaxed tone to stay in the temple for the winter, but I never thought to prepare myself. I must place an order with Mr. Benno now, but I don't have enough time to make a second batch of picture books and sell them. The paper and pigment will also be used for subsequent picture books, so I can't sell them… I've run out of money. \"\n\n\n As if he didn't know how to respond to my honest confession, Fran stiffened. He looked exactly like the Head Priest when he was perplexed, I thought, looking up at him. Recovering himself, he shook his head.\n\n\n \"Well, er… what happens if you don't have money? I don't quite understand what it's like to be without money, but I guess it means not being able to buy things… Right?\"\n\n\n Having grown up in the orphanage and once served the Head Priest who was rich enough to bring as many as five books to the temple, Fran had never heard of \"no money\". He said that he learned after serving me that sometimes not everything that people want can be obtained, and that money should be earned through work. If there was no money, even the master had to endure a poor life.\n\n\n \"Stop worrying, Fran. I'll make new picture books to sell as soon as possible, I also have the confidence to rely on handiwork to make money. I'm just lack of money for the time being. You must not let others know the truth. Just say that Mr. Benno likes these picture books so much that he would like to buy them at any rate. It would be a pity if the others could not do their shopping with pleasure.\"\n\n\n \"… at your command.\"\n\n\n By the time I had finished talking to Fran about my secret, the Gilberta Company was visible ahead. There was a figure in the doorway. The figure saw us and waved. It was Lutz.\n\n\n \"Lutz, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.\"\n\n\n \"Let's go home.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you, Fran, it's getting dark earlier than before, so go straight back to the temple. Please help me with what I just told you.\"\n\n\n When I said that, Fran nodded his head with a complex expression. He saluted me and walked off in the direction of the temple.\n\n\n Lutz and I set off for home, and on the way he told me about the outcome of his discussions with Benno.\n\n\n \"My master has promised me to send someone to consult with the villagers. But it all depends on the leasing of the smokehouse.\"\n\n\n \"Well, if only we could make gelatin before the blue-robed priests come back…\"\n\n\n \"Can I make it…?\" I muttered. Lutz shrugged, as if noncommittal.\n\n\n \"This is not the time to think about gelatin, Maine. You should worry more about pork processing. We're all new to this. It's still some time before the Company begin preparing for winter, so even if we go to the villages for help, it's almost impossible to find anyone with experience. Although my master said to send the butcher to help, it will be a mess if most people are inexperienced.\"\n\n\n We had expected to make winter preparations with the Gilberta Company, but now the preparations for the orphanage had to start earlier, so we went our separate ways. As a result, we had few experienced helpers. Most of us had never been involved in pork processing, so we didn't have a clue. I was the best example to prove that an inexperienced person was of no use at all.\n\n\n \"I'll ask Dad and Turi about it, but it's hard to say when we're not going to start yet.\"\n\n\n My mother was having a hard time being pregnant, and I couldn't let her do the heavy work, but I was hoping that my father and Turi could help. It was just that the date hadn't been decided yet and it was hard to ask them.\n\n\n \"Well, yeah… and are you sure you'd be all right? Your father would be mad if he knew you'd have to live in the temple for the winter.\"\n\n\n That was right. After dinner today, I would have a long-lost family meeting. Although I had to convince my family, I could imagine their faces, so my stomach was aching before I could see them.\n\n\n \"But it is your job to render the magic. I think it would be better for you to stay in the temple. To be honest, the temple rooms are definitely warmer than your own, and you would not catch cold easily there. Besides, Fran knows your condition well.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you, Lutz. I'll quote that to my family, because they believe you more than I do.\"\n\n\n \"Cheer up!\" Lutz encouraged me. After saying goodbye to him at Well Square, I walked slowly up the stairs to my house.\n\n\n \"What do you want to discuss, Maine?\"\n\n\n As I had imagined, the faces of my family suddenly changed when I said, \"I have something to discuss with you.\" I had little life left, I was about to enter the temple, I had an invitation to the temple… In retrospect, everything I had wanted to discuss so far was unnerving, and no wonder they were braced for it.\n\n\n \"Well, actually… today, the Head Priest told me that there was an important ceremony to be held in winter, and he was afraid that I would not be able to go to the temple because of the storm, so he asked me to stay at the temple all winter…\"\n\n\n \"What?! Didn't we say that Maine was going to stay at home?\"\n\n\n Just as I thought, father slapped the table and shouted excitedly. Not only did Turi and mother not stop him, they even nodded in agreement.\n\n\n \"That's true, but the Dedication is important. It's a ceremony to infuse magic into the sacred tools. If the magic isn't enough, the next year's harvest will be affected. A bad harvest will worry a lot of people, won't it?\"\n\n\n \"Huh? Is the temple responsible for doing that?\"\n\n\n Turi asked in surprise, and I nodded. Before I became a trainee priestess, I also had no idea what ceremonies would be held at the temple. The people in the temple hardly came to the commoners' quarter, and the commoners could saw the priests and priestesses only when they went to the temple for baptism and coming-of-age ceremonies. Moreover, the work of the temple would not be introduced to them, so the commoners did not think much of the temple.\n\n\n \"Your health is more important! What if something happened to you while you were alone in the temple?\"\n\n\n \"As Lutz has said, Fran knows my condition well. Besides, the Head Priest has promised that my family can visit me. That's the best he can do.\"\n\n\n Father clenched his teeth. Although he understood the importance of the ceremony, and the concession of the Head Priest, his reluctance betrayed itself. For a moment, a wave of sadness came over me.\n\n\n \"What is your own decision, Maine?\"\n\n\n Mother asked me. As if trying to calm herself down, she was gently stroking her belly. I had promised the Head Priest and asked many people to help me prepare for the winter. So, there was only one answer.\n\n\n \"… I will live in the temple. Because it is my job to participate in ceremonies.\"\n\n\n \"Maine!\"\n\n\n Father gave a loud roar, but I just shook my head at him.\n\n\n \"Dad, I am also the head of the orphanage. I have the responsibility to look after orphans. Moreover, I was able to enter the temple because my magic was needed. Thanks to the sanctuary of the temple, I put on the blue robe and got rid of the hard physical work.\"\n\n\n Father bit his lip, as if to swallow the words that came to his lips.\n\n\n \"The Head Priest has given me the best possible conditions, so I must be present at such a ceremony which requires magic. And I have seldom fallen ill from the eclipse, since I have begun to render my magic. Being in ceremonies is actually good for me.\"\n\n\n Without the magic tools, I would have died. I had lived until now because I could render my magic to the sacred tools in the temple.\n\n\n 'What if you were ill?\"\n\n\n \"I have a bed and attendants in my room, and I won't be left alone at the temple. But I need Turi to instruct my attendants on how to take care of me when I get a fever.\"\n\n\n \"That bed looked soft, I love it…\" \"Muttered Turi, who had been to the Dean's Office.\n\n\n \"I'll do it. Since they'll be taking care of Maine during the winter, I must go and say hello…\" Mother spoke.\n\n\n \"Mom, don't force yourself.\"\n\n\n \"It doesn't matter. Pregnancy is not illness, and my morning sickness is not so bad now.\"\n\n\n It seemed that she had made up her mind that when she was better she would come and see my room in the temple and say hello to my attendants. I had decided to live in the temple, and my mother was on my side. After all, it was impossible to overturn the decision of the exalted temple. Father scratched his head and finally gave up.\n\n\n \"… can the family visit you?\"\n\n\n \"Of course, I will be lonely, so do visit me.\"\n\n\n \"I have not only to be a sewing teacher, but also to learn to read, so I'll often go to the orphanage in the winter. I'll drop in on Maine then.\"\n\n\n Turi talked happily about what she expected to do when she went to the orphanage. At this, father turned a heavy face and stared at me.\n\n\n \"Why did you only ask your sister for help? You can count on Daddy more.\"\n\n\n Father was visibly upset when he found that his daughter did not count on him, so I quickly thought of some suitable jobs for him.\n\n\n \"Er… Dad, could you go to the orphanage and teach the children carpentry? It would be too hard for Lutz to teach alone.\"\n\n\n \"Sure, leave it to Daddy. Anything else?\"\n\n\n Although he was not a carpenter by trade, my father was very skillful with his hands, so it would be most suitable for him to be a carpentry teacher. As expected, he agreed with a smile. Since I could count on him and he was willing to help, I wanted to ask him a lot of things.\n\n\n \"There's more, there's more. Although the date hasn't been decided yet, I want Dad to help the orphanage process the pork. There's no one in the orphanage who's experienced in this, but we have to do it because the pork is our winter food.\"\n\n\n \"I must help you in this matter. When you set a date, I'll make time for you.\"\n\n\n \"By the way, I would like to know what I need for the winter. I had a fever every time you were preparing for the winter, so I never know what you have done. In fact, I have no idea what I lack in my room in the temple…\"\n\n\n So my family began to talk about things to prepare and pay attention to during the winter. Most of what they said was nagging about my health, but I could only write them down while listening."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n We were to meet at the Gilberta Company at the third bell of the day to shop for winter clothes, but Benno asked Lutz and I to come early to discuss winter preparations.\n\n\n \"What about Turi? Won't she be very bored while we're talking?\"\n\n\n \"She can go and talk to Corinna about sewing.\"\n\n\n Turi's blue eyes lit up at Benno's words. When Benno rang the bell, a maid appeared and started upstairs with Turi.\n\n\n \"Anyway, I've already ordered two pigs this morning, and I've asked two people at the butcher's to help you. Without the help of experts, you inexperienced people are just going to mess up, right?\"\n\n\n \"Really?! You've solved so many things in less than a day! Mr. Benno, you're so efficient! It's amazing!\"\n\n\n I clapped my hands and marveled. Benno gave me a smirk and puffed out his chest and said, \"Praise me more.\" I then had to order a lot of tools from him, so I lavished him with compliments.\n\n\n \"You are great! I admire you! If you can give me a discount, you will become more handsome in my eyes!\"\n\n\n \"You fool, this is not possible!\"\n\n\n \"Maine, you are too tactless.\"\n\n\n I was just trying to save some money. They could say no if they wanted, but why were they so shocked? Hum.\n\n\n \"As for the smokehouse, you can rent one any time during the next ten days. For preservation reasons, everyone wants to wait until late in the winter to process meat. So when do you want to start?\"\n\n\n Pork was a reserve food during the winter, so few people started processing it so early. Most of my neighbours started just before it snowed. Now only half of the basement was cold enough, so I thought the storage was a bigger problem than the shelf life. The pork might be eaten in the middle of the winter.\n\n\n \"Let's start in three days. That's when father and Turi will rest.\"\n\n\n \"Ok. I ordered the tools when we decided to work together, and most of them have been delivered. I can borrow them if you don't have enough, but don't forget to bring your own.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you, Mr. Benno. Besides, these are the winter supplies for the orphanage, in addition to wood and food.\"\n\n\n Benno frowned as he looked at my list on the board.\n\n\n \"… that's a lot.\"\n\n\n \"Since this is my first official winter preparation for the orphanage, I'm short of everything, and there are a lot of people…\"\n\n\n \"But the orphans have survived before. There's no need to make special preparations, is there?\"\n\n\n I smiled guiltily at Lutz's words. In fact, this year I was just going to start with wood and food, and then gradually filled the other orphans' needs.\n\n\n \"But there's no way my family would agree that I'm not prepared to live at the temple. It's a totally unexpected expense.\"\n\n\n \"You're right. After all, you faint a lot. It's normal for your family to worry about not being there for you.\"\n\n\n \"If you want to live at the temple for a long time, you do have a lot less stuff in your room.\"\n\n\n Since I usually had lunch at the temple, I had no problem with cutlery, but I was noticeably short on toiletry and bedding, such as towels and sheets, and I only had quilts and no blankets. If I brought my stuff with me, the style would not match what the temple had, and my family was already short of supplies, so I had to buy new ones.\n\n\n What's more, there was no carpet for autumn and winter in the room. I was told that the carpet left by the previous owner had become moldy and could not be used.\n\n\n \"Maine, I can lend you some money.\"\n\n\n \"No! I won't borrow money from a friend. It may ruin the friendship.\"\n\n\n When the third bell rang, Fran appeared with the rest of the attendants. Everyone was wearing a gray coat for the outing. Because of the simplicity of the coat, if they could have worn a scarf or gloves to add a bit of personalisation, it wouldn't have looked out of place on the street, but now they were dressed in the same way and it was quite striking.\n\n\n \"Looks like we can't wait to buy clothes.\"\n\n\n \"Right? Suddenly it seems to me that the coat is more important than the clothes under it. If they put on the coat, they can still wear the robe under it.\"\n\n\n No sooner had I said that than Benno shouted at me, \"Hey, that's no good! You've got to buy them the whole outfit!\"\n\n\n \"I'm just saying.\"\n\n\n \"You must be serious about eighty percent of what you say.\"\n\n\n He had guessed right, so I turned from my face in embarrassment and walked out of the Company, while Lutz ran upstairs to call Turi.\n\n\n \"Everyone can buy an outfit. Go find something you like.\"\n\n\n \"At your command!\"\n\n\n Turi and Delia chattered happily as they wandered around the Children's Section. Lutz and Gil, who were about the same height, also compete when it came to choosing clothes. Rosina, who was already about the size of an adult, chose her clothes quietly and alone in the Women's Section.\n\n\n \"… Master Maine, is it really all right?\"\n\n\n Fran asked me in a nervous whisper, and I calculated the amount of money I had left. I gave him a reassuring nod to show that there was no problem in buying clothes here. Taking this opportunity, I looked at the basket in his hand.\n\n\n \"Money is not an issue, and if it's not enough, I'll sell some picture books. Go and help yourself to an outfit, Fran. When the weather gets cold, you'll need more clothes in your room.\"\n\n\n I could only act like a master occasionally, so I asked Fran generously not to worry about money today. But he looked at the multitude of clothes on display in the shop with great perplexity and didn't move his feet.\n\n\n \"I don't know how to choose my clothes…\"\n\n\n If Fran had to choose clothes for his master, he could choose according to the location, the season, the purpose of his master's journey, and who his master would visit, but he didn't know how to apply this skill to himself. Seeing him at a loss about his own affairs, I had to come up with some criteria for his reference.\n\n\n \"First, the clothes must fit you, and then you must check if the fabric is good. Since it's winter wear, warmth is also important. Choose something that fits and keeps you warm, and I will help you pick out the one that suits you best.\"\n\n\n \"I can't thank you enough, Master Maine.\"\n\n\n Fran's expression betrayed a hint of trepidation. I smiled, remembering what my mother had said last night.\n\n\n \"Fran, my mother said she would like to visit the Dean's Office. When do you think would be a good time for her to visit?\"\n\n\n When I indicated that my mother said she wanted to see the room to make sure it was comfortable for me during the winter, Fran cast down his eyes.\n\n\n \"…Master Maine, I don't think your mother is suitable for coming to the temple. I told you before that many people in the temple have very complicated feelings about pregnant women and their so-called family members. Delia who hates going to the orphanage is actually a sensitive girl, and the visit of your mother may reach the Temple Chief's ears, so if your mother wants to ask me something in person, let me visit your house.\"\n\n\n I glanced at Dalia who was giggling, and then slowly nodded. When Fran and I were in the adult section, Benno paced over leisurely.\n\n\n \"Did you say you were going to live at the temple?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I can't stay in the temple in cheap clothes every day, can I?\"\n\n\n \"Of course. Casual clothes, visiting clothes, pajamas, clothes for going out, these must be bought. Your underclothes must be of good quality, too. You must also buy several pairs of thick socks, for the temple is not warm in winter.\"\n\n\n \"… Oh dear, the expense will be terrible, and since no one's going to see my underclothes anyway, it doesn't matter if they're of a lower quality, does it?\"\n\n\n Only where you can see is there a need for decency -- Benno's eyes were bulging with anger at my words.\n\n\n \"How can a person only do appearances? Besides, you are easily taken ill. You must wear more clothes!\"\n\n\n \"So I should buy as many as I can wear, right?\"\n\n\n I had to buy a lot of clothes if I wanted to wear several to keep warm. I could buy as many as I wanted at the usual thrift store, but the cost of decent clothes for the temple would be devastating to my purse. In the end, it was my winter preparations that cost the most money.\n\n\n \"You can buy cloth from me, and then ask your mother and sister to make your underclothes. They're both very good at it, aren't they?\"\n\n\n \"They are very good indeed… but I'm sure I don't have enough money. Mr. Benno, please buy five of the picture books I made before.\"\n\n\n \"Then why not print more? You can print many of the same picture books as long as you have pigment, right?\"\n\n\n \"Ah… if you want to print picture books, you have to print them all at once.\"\n\n\n I hung my head in regret as I remembered my blunder. Benno raised his eyebrows, not seeming to understand me.\n\n\n \"When the pigment dried, the paper templates got out of shape and couldn't be used again. The templates were exquisitely engraved, and they weren't made of metal or wood, so the pigment on them could not be washed off, which made them disposable…\"\n\n\n A lot of paper was needed to make picture books, so my initial idea was to make 30 copies to see the response. What I didn't expect was that the templates we had invested so much in were disposable, and I cried at the time because I thought it was too wasteful.\n\n\n \"In the future, I will prepare a lot of paper in advance and then print all the picture books in one breath.\"\n\n\n \"If you don't have enough paper, you can order it from my workshop.\"\n\n\n \"… no, it's too expensive. I'll make it at the Maine Workshop and buy it from Lutz.\"\n\n\n I puffed out my cheeks unhappily, and Benno gave me a wry smile. Just then we heard the loud voices of Lutz and Gil, who seemed to be having a quarrel over the same coat. \"I've already told you! It's mine!\" Benno's cheek twitched.\n\n\n \"… Maine, go and reconcile them.\"\n\n\n I trotted in the direction of the brawl and saw Lutz and Gil arguing about the same coat. They were about the same height, so it was not like I couldn't understand them at all.\n\n\n \"You're making too much noise. Be quiet. It's very rude of you to disturb others.\"\n\n\n As soon as they saw me, they rushed at me, clutching the same coat.\n\n\n \"Maine, who do you think will fit this coat better, Gil or me? It must be me!\"\n\n\n \"No! It would look better on me, Master Maine!\"\n\n\n They both bore down on me with fearful faces. I looked at the aqua-blue coat in their hands, sighed deliberately and shook my head.\n\n\n \"It doesn't fit either of you.\"\n\n\n They probably didn't expect me to give such an answer, so they both stared at me with round eyes.\n\n\n It was not the style that didn't fit! It was that their pale hair color combined with an aqua-blue coat would only make it visually colder. It was fine for summer, but definitely not for winter.\n\n\n \"Lutz, didn't Mr. Benno say before? There are warm colours and cool colours. Which do you think is the colour of this coat? And what colour is better to wear in the cold winter?\"\n\n\n Lutz reacted quickly and let go, but Gil still held the aqua-blue coat and cocked his head in confusion."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"Gil, put this aqua-blue coat back and try on this auburn coat and these brown trousers. They look warmer, don't they?\"\n\n\n \"I see. I'll try them on.\"\n\n\n Gil turned and walked away. Lutz sank his shoulders in frustration and watched the clothes I pulled out one after another. The camel coat looked very thin at first sight, but it should be warm with a fine fur lining.\n\n\n \"Lutz, you want to wear these dark brown trousers, don't you? Match them with this camel… this tan or this green coat. See which you prefer, but these two coats are of different fabric, and you must take into account the circumstances in which we live.\"\n\n\n \"Then this is the only one I can choose!\"\n\n\n Lutz grabbed the camel coat and glared at me. The fabric of the green coat was too superior to be worn around our house.\n\n\n \"Well, but aqua blue wouldn't be right for the season, would it?\"\n\n\n Lutz gave a grunt of disapproval, then said no more, but put on the camel coat in silence. Although the coat was a bit oversized, he would wear a thick shirt in the winter, and if he wanted to be able to wear it next year, a bigger size would be nice. The fur lining seemed to warm him, and at last he smiled.\n\n\n As Lutz was contentedly dressed in his camel coat, Turi came over with a dress in each hand.\n\n\n \"Which do you think is better, Maine?\"\n\n\n She was holding a dress in dark green with delicate floral embroidery and a dress in navy blue with a simple design. Personally, I'd love to see Turi dressed as a maid in a navy-blue dress and a white apron.\n\n\n \"Why did you choose these two?\"\n\n\n \"I chose this one because it's beautiful. Look, the colour and embroidery are great, and I think it goes well with my hair. The other one is because the fabric is nice and warm.\"\n\n\n In her usual pragmatism, she would definitely go for the navy-blue one, but she seemed to prefer the dark-green one.\n\n\n \"The overly beautiful dress might be too dramatic, but in winter you wear a coat over it. Since it will be covered up, I think you can choose whichever one you like. I think warmth is more important than beauty, but you want the beautiful one, right?\"\n\n\n \"Hmmm… it's so confusing.\"\n\n\n If she wanted to improve her taste as a tailor, I thought it was ok to buy something she liked. However, her mind was always limited by her common sense, and it was hard for her to choose beauty over utility.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, I want this dress!\"\n\n\n Just as Turi was hesitating, Delia sprinted over with a lovely pink dress and a warm coat. This smart girl was really good at seizing opportunities to exploit me! However, I could see that she was very happy, so I couldn't say no. I would give up the struggle today and pay for everyone.\n\n\n \"Well, you've decided on these two, haven't you?\n\n\n \"Thank you very much, Master Maine! Ho-ho!\"\n\n\n Delia hummed and looked at her pink dress, beaming with joy. Seeing her so happy, although the price was a little high, I also felt the money was not spent in vain. I didn't understand the feelings of those who spend a lot of money on gifts for lovely girls, but now I did.\n\n\n Turi seemed to have made up her mind to see Delia so happy with her lovely dress. She held out her dark-green dress to me.\n\n\n \"Maine, I want this beautiful one!\"\n\n\n \"Ok, but the coats here are so eye-catching in our quarter and workplace, so you have to give them up. Instead, you can buy a shawl or scarf here. By the way, don't forget to choose two for Mom and Dad.\"\n\n\n \"No problem! Thank you, Maine!\"\n\n\n Watching Turi happily run away, I walked over to Rosina, who was alone picking out the clothes. She seemed to have chosen her own clothes. She held a carmine dress in her hand and stared at an unadorned navy-blue dress. It looked so plain that Even Wilma, who had said that she wanted some drawing tools rather than clothes, would have liked to wear it.\n\n\n \"Rosina, speaking of Wilma's clothes…\"\n\n\n \"She said she didn't need new clothes, because she couldn't leave the temple. But now that she was able to make her appearance at the workshop from time to time, I thought she would be pleased if I bought her a simple dress to wear when she went to the workshop… Well, Wilma really hates dressing herself.\"\n\n\n It was a shame that she was so pretty but didn't like to dress up. But this was her personal choice, and I couldn't force her to change.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, you need not be discouraged. For her, going to the workshop with the children was a big step forward. \"\n\n\n Rosina smiled softly. I walked with her to the counter and found Fran standing motionless in the men's section. Perhaps because of the customer base, the shop had the most men's clothes. Surrounded by so many clothes, Fran looked desperate.\n\n\n \"Fran, have you chosen yet?\"\n\n\n \"… Master Maine.\"\n\n\n Fran turned around with a rare look of helplessness. He's kind of cute for being so overwhelmed.\n\n\n \"Your temperament is of the steady type, and if you like something simple, this one or that one will complement your temperament. If you want to look more tasteful, go for this one or this one.\"\n\n\n \"Master Maine… please decide for me.\"\n\n\n Seeing Fran's dismay, Rosina took a step forward, her chestnut hair floating gently with her movements.\n\n\n \"Fran, you have to overcome something you're not good at.\"\n\n\n \"Rosina, you look happy with the reversal of your usual position with Fran.\"\n\n\n \"Because I can finally help him.\"\n\n\n \"Then I'll leave the matter in your hands. I have no other opinion.\"\n\n\n Seeing Rosina in such high spirits, I ignored Fran, who had tried to reach me for help, and walked back to Benno. Clothes that had been chosen by others were neatly put on the counter, but no one was there except Benno.\n\n\n \"Where are the others, Mr. Benno?\"\n\n\n \"I was afraid they would make too much noise, so I told them to pick out your clothes. You'll need at least two or three for casual wear, and one for visiting and one for going out. I think they'll have a close match this time, so just relax.\"\n\n\n Benno said that Lutz and Turi, who had tied last time, had gone in search of clothes in sparks, and that Delia and Gil had joined the fight because they were my attendants.\n\n\n \"Oooh… the clothes here are so expensive. In the end, I spent the most money.\"\n\n\n \"Of course, after all, you have to dress like an aristocrat. As a commoner, you have already incurred the repugnance of the other priests and priestesses by wearing blue robe, and now you must not stir up others by wandering about the temple dressed as a pauper.\"\n\n\n Benno was absolutely right, so I hung my head. As I was counting my money desperately at the counter, Turi and Lutz rushed over with the clothes they had chosen for me.\n\n\n \"How about this one, Maine?\"\n\n\n They were both carrying thick shirts, long skirts and vests. Last time I told them there are more styles than dresses, so this time they had chosen to go beyond dresses. Delia and Gil followed them, also carrying some clothes.\n\n\n \"This is lovely, Master Maine.\"\n\n\n This time I was shown two dresses. There were not many clothes for my size here, which means I now had all the clothes I could wear in this shop in front of me.\n\n\n As they watched, I pondered which clothes to choose. Perhaps having finally chosen the right clothes, Fran and Rosina returned to the counter. Hearing that I was finally starting to pick out clothes, they also leaned over to examine the pile of clothes on the counter and tried to give me advice.\n\n\n \"If you are going to walk about the temple, these clothes will make you look more respectable.\"\n\n\n \"There is also a blessing ceremony in the spring, and you will leave the city with the Head Priest, so this is the right dress for your status. Then this one and that one should be your choice.\"\n\n\n Fran and Rosina started picking out the clothes I needed to live at the temple without me doing it myself. Although the attendants were very reliable, my purse was about to suffer a catastrophe.\n\n\n \"No!\" I uttered a silent cry in my heart. Benno crooked his finger, called Lutz to him, and whispered something. Lutz's eyes lit up and he clapped his hands.\n\n\n \"Maine, I will buy your clothes!\"\n\n\n \"Lutz?! Mr. Benno, what did you instill in him?!\"\n\n\n I glared at Benno, who merely grunted and looked at Lutz with interest.\n\n\n \"Every time you invent something new, you give me half the profit, and you helped me make up with my family before, so it's kind of a thank you gift. Friends can't borrow money from each other, but they can give each other gifts, right?\"\n\n\n Lutz puffed out his chest complacently, but I thought it was too much for gift-giving. And having men outside the family buy clothes for me was something even Urano didn't have. I was so upset that I didn't know what to do, but Benno was laughing and helping Lutz along.\n\n\n \"Maine, how can you refuse a gift from a man in front of so many people? It will not only make you look unromantic, but also make a man lose face.\"\n\n\n Although Benno's tone was full of humor, it would have been embarrassing for Lutz if I had refused. I didn't know how to turn him down tactfully. I looked around for help, but Delia scolded me with arms akimbo:\n\n\n \"What are you hesitating about? You just have to accept them with a smile. A man's gift is the best way to show a woman's value.\"\n\n\n \"Delia, please don't talk.\"\n\n\n If that's what she said, I was like a bad woman asking men to pay tribute to her. This made it more difficult for me to receive the clothes from Lutz. While I was in distress, Lutz held up his guild card and tapped me on the shoulder.\n\n\n \"I have paid for it. Give it up, Maine.\"\n\n\n … Lutz, how can you be so smart! Please give me some of your IQ!\n\n\n \"Well done.\" Benno smiled and rubbed Lutz's hair. I thought Lutz was definitely influenced by him. Even with Rosina's aristocratic upbringing, I still hadn't learned anything about tact, and I felt really disheartened about myself. But it was no use thinking about it. All I could do was pay for Turi and the attendants' clothes.\n\n\n The attendants went into the dressing room in order, put on their new clothes, and put the old ones into baskets. My clothes were to be brought back to the temple, so the attendants had folded them for me. While the others were concentrating on the clothes in front of them, I quickly approached Lutz and said:\n\n\n \"Lutz, thank you… you've really done me a big favor.\"\n\n\n \"Never mind. It was my master who reminded me.\"\n\n\n Not just paper, but picture books, hangers, writing boards and so on. You split the profits on everything, but you didn't split the initial investment with Maine -- Lutz said Benno reminded him.\n\n\n \"Although my master said I should wait until you found out or really ran out of money, you must be broken by now, so you wouldn't mind, would you?\"\n\n\n … Whoops! I didn't notice it at all.\n\n\n So I accepted Lutz's offer and spent it on cloth for my underclothes, replacement sheets and a winter carpet. Then we finished our winter shopping by buying the orphans' winter clothes and miscellaneous supplies."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The day after the shopping, the children of the Maine Workshop had a new job, which was to carry back to the temple what I had ordered from Benno. The children changed into thick clothes, piled the luggage on new carts, and bustled between the Gilberta Company and the orphanage. Half of the supplies were sent to my room, the other half to be used in the orphanage, and not only that, but tools for pork processing were coming in one after another.\n\n\n \"Everyone, please unpack here first. Anything that needs to be carried to the Dean's Office, please give it to Gil. Move the wood and ingredients to the basement of the girls' dormitory, and the tools to the basement of the boys' dormitory.\"\n\n\n As he counted the supplies, Fran instructed people to move them. The reason why such allocation, because the ground floor of the girls' dormitory was the kitchen, the ground floor of the boys' dormitory was the Maine Workshop. Food that needed to be kept would be locked up in the warehouse and managed by Wilma, so that the children could not touch it without permission. If the grain reserves were eaten before the winter was over, everyone would be troubled.\n\n\n The gray-robed priests and priestesses carried supplies to the basements of the boys' and girls' dormitories, while the children helped out and made joyful noises. Lutz looked at the scene and said:\n\n\n \"My family said they would also come to help with the pork processing. My dad seemed to be very grateful to the Head Priest, though he didn't say so explicitly.\"\n\n\n Stubborn, reticent, and with a craftsman's temper, old Dido was never a flatterer, but he seemed grateful to the Head Priest who had provided equal opportunities to communicate.\n\n\n \"But you see, the Head Priest is an aristocrat, and my dad couldn't find a way to thank him. So he thought, in that case, he'd help the orphanage instead, and it turned out to be all of us.\"\n\n\n \"All of you… Uncle Dido has made another arbitrary decision, hasn't he?\"\n\n\n Dido's four children were all boys, and it would be a great help to have them on board, but I worried about their individual will.\n\n\n \"Don't worry, my brothers all said, 'I'll be sorry if I don't help', and my mom was very concerned about it.\"\n\n\n \"With your family's help, it will go smoothly. I'm looking forward to pork processing!\"\n\n\n Ha, ha, ha. I laughed excitedly, but Lutz frowned at me.\n\n\n \"What are you thinking about? Of course you must stay, Maine. You have a fever at this time of year, and the last time you were alone you passed out on the stand with a fever and were sent to the gate, weren't you? This is going to be pork processing with a bunch of completely inexperienced people, and I have no reason to let you go.\"\n\n\n \"You're right… but now that mom's pregnant and I'm going to be a sister next year, I've decided I have to learn how to process pork this year.\"\n\n\n I managed to train myself to the point where I could watch a pig being dissected without shedding a tear, but he actually told me that I could not participate in pork processing, which made me very disappointed. And this year, in order to be sure to help my neighbors with their pork processing, I thought I would take advantage of this opportunity to practice.\n\n\n \"No, since the orphans are going to be there, you can't do anything yourself. If you stay out and watch us work all day, you'll have a fever, and you won't be able to make that gelatin, will you?\"\n\n\n Lutz listed one reason after another why I couldn't go, but the worst part was that I couldn't argue with him.\n\n\n \"You're meant to stay, and you don't have a choice, so you might as well take this opportunity to figure out how to make money. Er… what was that line? I thought you said it before… Oh, Now I think of it -- everyone has a place.\"\n\n\n \"Ooh…\"\n\n\n On the morning of the pork processing, my family and Lutz's family met at Well Square, worked out the details, and decided to send me, father and Turi to the orphanage. Because I had to wait in the orphanage, father and Turi took on the task of moving tools and showing the children the way.\n\n\n As an apprentice of the Gilberta Company, Lutz went to the butcher shop and led the staff to the village, where his family went to prepare the smokehouse and fetch water.\n\n\n \"Well, let's start today according to the groups we've just set up. The pork processing group is responsible for pushing carts to the village, and the housekeeping group is responsible for cleaning the temple and orphanage, and preparing soup for dinner.\"\n\n\n Fran divided all the members of the orphanage into two groups. Except for those who were in charge of supervision, all the gray-robed priests suitable for manual work were put into the pork processing group.\n\n\n \"Dad, make sure you bring the pig skins, I'm going to use them to make gelatin. I can't help it if I don't have the bones and guts, but I need the skins! Please, Dad!\"\n\n\n When I reminded father to bring the pig skins, he patted me on the head and said,\n\n\n \"I know, I know. Just stay in your room and be careful not to run a fever. Didn't Lutz say the task ahead is important?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. I'd like to go to the village with you, but I'll wait till you come back.\"\n\n\n After reminding father, I ran to Turi, who was carrying things with the children.\n\n\n \"Turi, please take care of Delia.\"\n\n\n \"I will. We'll look out for each other today, Delia.\"\n\n\n Turi turned to Delia and grinned. But Delia raised her eyebrows and protested:\n\n\n \"Why must I go, Master Maine?\"\n\n\n \"Because I want you to see the world beyond the temple.\"\n\n\n Among my attendants, Rosina and Wilma would stay, but the rest would go to the village. Delia was reluctant to participate, but I forced her to. I wanted her to be able to interact with orphans outside of the orphanage. She didn't seem to have much contact with the orphans, but when shopping, I saw that she and Turi were kindred spirits, and that Gil and Fran would be there, so she wouldn't be alone.\n\n\n \"What are you going to do here, Maine?\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to make a new picture book. Rosina and Wilma will work with me. Both of them have beautiful handwriting and can draw illustrations.\"\n\n\n Rosina was not only good at music, but also good at handwriting, so I decided to ask her to help me make my next picture book. And today, when all the male attendants were out, Wilma would feel free to come to the Dean's Office to work with me on the picture book. I also asked her to bring two girls who liked cooking to give them special training in the kitchen.\n\n\n Rosina and I watched everyone leave and went back to the Dean's Office. I was practicing the fespiel when Wilma came with two girls.\n\n\n \"Nicola and Monica, please practice your cooking in order to make a great meal.\"\n\n\n After encouraging the nervous girls, I asked Rosina to take them to the kitchen.\n\n\n \"During the Harvest Festival, the grace of god would be very humble with the absence of the blue-robed priests and priestesses. Some of the priests and priestesses would take the cooks with them, while other cooks would cut corners without the supervision of their masters. If we didn't know how to cook ourselves, these ten days would be very hard.\"\n\n\n I shivered when I heard what Wilma had said. I was the only blue-robed priestess who would stay in the temple during the Harvest Festival. If all the blue-robed priests and priestesses had gone out with cooks, there would be no grace of god at all.\n\n\n \"In previous years, the number of the blue-robed priests and priestesses was not as small as it is now. So even if half of them took the cooks to the Festival, at least half of the cooks stayed in the temple. In front of the other priests and priestesses, the cooks would never cut corners in order not to lose face with their masters. But now…\"\n\n\n With a sigh, Wilma's eyes darkened as she lowered them. But soon they had regained their former charm, and she looked at me and said:\n\n\n \"Thanks to you, we've been able to cook for ourselves, and the young children won't have to go hungry. And you've made preparations for the orphanage for the winter, which I'm very grateful to you for. So please don't hesitate to tell me anything I can do.\"\n\n\n With that, she went up to the second floor and began to lay out drawing tools on the table.\n\n\n \"Is this the next story?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, the story is called Cinderella.\"\n\n\n Wilma was reading Cinderella, so I picked up the fespiel and started practicing. What I wanted to practice was the third etude requested by the Head Priest and the self-selected song. In order to match the season, I chose \"Little Fox\" for this self-selected song, but according to the environment here, I changed the little fox into a little rabbit. It was never a big deal.\n\n\n \"What a nostalgic sound.\"\n\n\n \"Do you play it too?\"\n\n\n \"I'm just an amateur. You are used to the sound played by Rosina, I'm afraid the sound I played will be harsh to you.\"\n\n\n Said Wilma with a smile. But she was definitely better than me, who was still a beginner.\n\n\n \"Rosina is such a good fespielist, so I don't know what kind of amateur you mean. I want to hear you play.\"\n\n\n \"It's really just a hobby.\"\n\n\n Delighted at the touch of the long-lost instrument, Wilma took Rosina's fespiel with a look of ecstasy.\n\n\n She plucked at the strings, and the sound was true to her character. Soft and calm, like her, it made me feel safe. If she sang with her lullaby voice now, I was sure I would fall asleep."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"Your music is as soft as ever.\"\n\n\n \"I don't have your skill, so I have to pick something soothing.\"\n\n\n They were happily exchanging musical notes, and I couldn't get a word in edgeways except to be amazed at how much they expected of themselves. If Wilma's level was amateur, the aristocratic children were masters.\n\n\n \"… If Wilma's level of music is considered amateur to you, may I venture to guess that Rosina is also a good painter?\"\n\n\n \"We all have to hone a skill to the point where we can call it a hobby.\"\n\n\n From the level of Wilma's playing, I could approximate the level of Rosina's drawing. It seemed that Lady Christine was a very unusual trainee priestess for her attendants to receive such a high level of education.\n\n\n After the third bell rang, I finished the practice of fespiel and began to make the picture book of Cinderella. After Wilma had read the story, I discussed with her what illustrations to add.\n\n\n \"It's very difficult to show Cinderella's beauty. Besides, if it's only black and white, there's no difference in skin tone…\"\n\n\n \"What if Cinderella was separated from her stepmother and stepsisters by her figure?\"\n\n\n \"But that stepmother must be a beautiful lady, since she is capable of becoming the second wife of a middle level aristocrat.\"\n\n\n I had intended to embody Cinderella's beauty, but now I was forced to face the fact that her stepmother and stepsisters were beautiful, too. I was lost in thought, when Rosina suggested to me,\n\n\n \"Would it not be more convenient, my Master Maine, to reprint the Children's Edition of the Scriptures, than to trouble yourself with new stories? I think it is a little premature for you to write about the aristocracy. At least it will be more appropriate to consider the matter when you are acquainted with the interior of the temple.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest had said the same thing. Even Rosina pointed out how little I knew about aristocratic society.\n\n\n \"I wanted to make the picture book of Cinderella because I wanted to know if common stories would be accepted…\"\n\n\n \"That, Master Maine, is the language of a person who can write common stories.\"\n\n\n Rosina shook her head at me. \"Rosina, you're being too direct.\" Wilma tried to stop her. But this also meant that Wilma also felt that Cinderella was not a common story.\n\n\n \"… isn't Cinderella a common story?\"\n\n\n \"The stories people often hear are about the founding of this empire, the gods and the knights. I've never heard anything like Cinderella.\"\n\n\n Most of the stories they heard while serving Lady Christine were art-related. In this case, without a proper investigation, it would be impossible to make picture books acceptable to the aristocracy.\n\n\n \"Which do you think would be more acceptable to the aristocracy, the Children's Edition of the Scripture or Cinderella?\"\n\n\n \"The Children's Edition of the Scripture, of course, because it contains the knowledge needed to improve education, and it's easy to understand.\"\n\n\n They both said so bluntly that I decided to give up the picture book of Cinderella. Knowing that Cinderella would not be accepted, of course I had to make other picture books that were sure to sell well.\n\n\n \"Then let's give up Cinderella and remake the Children's Edition of the Scripture… Rosina, can you tell me the stories people often hear when you have a spare moment? I want to use them as the material for the next picture book.\"\n\n\n \"Those are the stories that you need to know to improve your education. You can always come to me.\"\n\n\n We took apart a Children's Edition of the Scripture and cut all the inside pages in half, dividing them into text and illustrations. The illustrations were then engraved over the thick paper that was originally used to make the Cinderella templates. In this way, we could print exactly the same illustrations as before. Rosina took the penknife that Lutz had put in the workshop, and together with Wilma she engraved the templates in earnest.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, please make the text templates as you did last time.\"\n\n\n Rosina smiled and assigned me work. I could only nod in agreement, as they quickly concluded that I was not suited for the job of making delicate templates for illustration.\n\n\n … Rosina had great hands and could engrave beautifully, but I must have been bad at this job just because my hands were so small! I believed that when I grew up, I would be dexterous, too.\n\n\n As for the fact that as an adult Urano had not become dexterous, I decided to ignore it.\n\n\n Before the sixth bell, the dinner to be delivered to the orphanage was finished, and Nicola and Monica, the first cook's assistants, walked out of the kitchen exhausted. I was going to have Fran deliver the dinner to the orphanage when he got back, so I asked Rosina to call the chef off duty.\n\n\n \"… why haven't they come back?\"\n\n\n \"It takes a long time to process pork. They will probably be back at the last second before the entrance guard.\"\n\n\n I said, looking out of the window. I could see the sun fading into the western sky. People in the city didn't process pork until it got colder, so traditionally the sun would have set long before my family would have returned home. So my guess was that they would not be back for a while. While I was thinking this, Delia came back panting. Her cheeks were as red as an apple, and I wondered whether it was because it was getting cold outside or because she had been running all the way back.\n\n\n \"Delia, you're back. How did it go?\"\n\n\n \"I'm back! We've made a lot of pork products! I think we'll be fine this winter!\"\n\n\n I had been worried about her, but now I was relieved to see her so happy. She had come back early to help me get dressed, and she said the others were moving all sorts of processed pork into the basement. As she helped me dress, she went on and on about how they made the sausages and how skilled the butcher staff were at cutting meat.\n\n\n \"And this big piece of bacon from the orphanage was hung up and smoked. It's amazing to hear that the meat doesn't spoil so easily after being smoked! And…\"\n\n\n I could see that working with others on pork was a good stimulus for her. Hopefully in the future she would start interacting with the orphans just as she did today.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, Lutz said he wanted to talk to you about pig skins. Will you please move to the workshop when you are finished dressing?\"\n\n\n From downstairs came the voice of Fran. I urged Delia to hurry up, and as soon as I had finished dressing I went downstairs.\n\n\n \"Gil, you go with Master Maine.\"\n\n\n On the way to the workshop, I saw many carts near the gate of the orphanage, where people were busy carrying food into the basement of the girls' dormitory. I also saw my father and Turi. Resisting the urge to run to them, I headed for the workshop.\n\n\n \"Maine, what do you do with these pig skins?\"\n\n\n Lutz asked as soon as he saw me, pointing to the rolled pig skins. I looked around the workshop, pointed to a pot and said, \"Put them in that pot first.\"\n\n\n \"No need to do anything beforehand?\"\n\n\n \"I was thinking of soaking it in lime water to remove the hair. But as I don't know how long it will take, I'd better watch and get rid of the hair slowly. Besides, it's quite late today, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"Just don't waste them.\" Lutz took out his writing board and glanced at me with his pen in hand. I immediately understood what he meant and started explaining to him how to make gelatin.\n\n\n \"First, you soke the skins in lime water to remove the hair, and then you peel them off into two layers, the inner layer and the outer layer for tanning. Can you do that?\"\n\n\n \"I'm not very good at it.\"\n\n\n Lutz shrugs, his eyes urging me on.\n\n\n \"The inner layer is one of the ingredients. But the outer layer is not used to make gelatin, so we can tan it to make the book cover.\"\n\n\n \"Who does the tanning?\"\n\n\n Lutz glared at me, and I flinched.\n\n\n \"Er… leather workshop?\"\n\n\n \"When you have money.\"\n\n\n I was stung by his words and could only pretend not to hear them and go on.\n\n\n \"The inner layer should be soaked in lime water until it is swollen and soft, which means the 'protein' and 'fat' have been eliminated. This happens naturally, so you just leave it alone. Then wash it clean, put it in hot water and cook it over low heat for two bells.\"\n\n\n \"Two bells? That's a long time.\"\n\n\n Lutz said as he took notes on his writing board.\n\n\n \"Then comes the hard part. To keep the water at the same temperature as the tea we drink, the impurities float up or settle down and the middle part becomes transparent. We use the clear middle part.\"\n\n\n When I stopped, Lutz looked up from his writing board, looking puzzled.\n\n\n \"… how do you use only the middle part?\"\n\n\n \"I have no experience either. We'll have to try.\"\n\n\n \"Are you kidding? Is it ok to scoop the needed parts into a small pot?\"\n\n\n I knew I could gently scoop out the impurities that were floating up, but I didn't know how to do it or to what extent, so I had to try.\n\n\n \"The final step is to pour the liquid into the box, put it by the window and let it cool and set.\"\n\n\n \"Well… it takes a long time to soak and boil, so we should make candles at the same time.\"\n\n\n Lutz looked at the notes on his writing board and concluded.\n\n\n \"Then tomorrow when we make gelatins, we'll make candles, too. We'll do the stinking stuff all at once.\"\n\n\n \"Good! We must work hard tomorrow!\"\n\n\n We're going to make gelatin! I threw up my hands in excitement."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n After the Harvest Festival, the blue-robed priests seemed to have returned to the temple. Although I hadn't seen them with my own eyes, it was easy to guess from the fact that the Grace of God had increased in the orphanage.\n\n\n The village to which the Head Priest had been sent was near, so that he came back quite early among the priests. My official duties were soon resumed, and every day, after the third bell, I went to the Head Priest's Office to help.\n\n\n \"Head Priest, I have done my calculations.\"\n\n\n This day, as always, I tried to calculate the accounts given to me by the Head Priest. The work was over, and I looked up just in time to see a white bird flying straight towards the window. “Look out!” I could not refrain from shouting, but the next second, the white bird flew through the window, circled the room, and fluttered down to the table, folding up its wings in a dignified manner.\n\n\n \"Whoa! What's this?!\"\n\n\n My eyes widened in surprise, but the attendants, unlike me, all seemed to understand where the bird came from, and all stared at it with some nervousness.\n\n\n \"Maine, be quiet.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest reprimanded me severely and reached out his hand to the white bird. Suddenly, a male voice came out of the bird's mouth.\n\n\n \"Ferdinand, the Order has made a request. Go at once.\"\n\n\n The words were repeated three times before the white bird disappeared, leaving only a yellow gem where it had been.\n\n\n Out of nowhere, the Head Priest took a wand that looked like a glowing baton, gabbled something, and tapped on the yellow gem. After a twist, the gem became the same white bird again.\n\n\n \"I see.\"\n\n\n So said the Head Priest to the white bird. He waved his wand, and the bird spread its wings and flew away through the window as it had entered the room.\n\n\n … Wow! Fantastic!\n\n\n The Head Priest glared at me when I was overjoyed at the magic he had done. When I recollected myself, I found that the attendants, who had been working quietly until now, began to tidy up hurriedly.\n\n\n \"Maine, the Order has made its request! Change into ceremonial dress, and march to the Patrician Gate!\"\n\n\n Affected by the amazing momentum of the Head Priest, I also responded with high spirit: \"Yes!\" But I didn't know where the Patrician Gate was.\n\n\n \"Er… where is the Patrician Gate?\"\n\n\n \"I know where it is.\"\n\n\n And as he spoke, Fran bowed to the Head Priest. Then he picked me up and strode toward the Dean's Office.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, you didn't forget your prayers, did you?\"\n\n\n Fran was walked so fast that I felt like I was going to throw up, so I just grabbed him and nodded.\n\n\n \"Delia, Rosina! Get the ceremonial dress ready at once!\"\n\n\n As soon as he opened the door of the Dean’s Office, Fran shouted in a loud voice I had never heard before. Without stopping for a moment, he quickly ascended the first floor to lower me, then turned and ran down the stairs.\n\n\n Delia rushed over with the ceremonial dress, placed it on the table and immediately began to take off the blue robe I was wearing.\n\n\n \"Whoa!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, please don't move!\"\n\n\n Her movements were not so gentle as usual, but rather rough. I was staggered by her, and then her water-blue eyes cast a fierce look at me. I wasn't sure what to make of their haste, but the ceremonial dress was already on me. I had no sooner put my arms up my sleeves than Rosina started tying my belt. Delia then handed her a long yellow ribbon, which she quickly wrapped around my belt to create a decorative knot.\n\n\n … What an amazing collaboration.\n\n\n As Rosina tied my belt, Delia pulled out my hairpin in a split second. Before my hair was even down, Rosina reached under my arm and lifted me into a chair.\n\n\n \"You are dealing with the Order, Master Maine. If anything has happened that makes you unhappy, it must not show in your face.\"\n\n\n As I sat in the chair, Rosina began combing my hair. While this was going on, Delia took out from the closet the ornate hairpin I had worn at the baptism.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, please use this instead.\"\n\n\n I took the hairpin Delia had handed me and curled my hair as usual.\n\n\n \"Master Maine is ready!\"\n\n\n Delia shouted. As soon as her voice fell, Fran rushed up, opened a bag that he was carrying, and dumped on the table all the tools I used to help the Head Priest with his duties.\n\n\n \"Rosina, put these things in their places. Master Maine, this is an emergency, so I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\n Fran picked me up again and strode out of the Dean's Office.\n\n\n \"Where is the Patrician Gate, Fran?\"\n\n\n \"It's in the deepest part of the aristocratic section of the temple. The Patrician Gate is the gate leading to the aristocratic quarter. When the blue-robed priests and priestesses go to the aristocratic quarter for ceremonies, they must pass through this gate.\"\n\n\n In order to avoid meeting the blue-robed priests and priestesses, I had always been careful not to linger near the aristocratic section, plus I was a commoner, there was no business to go to the aristocratic quarter, so it was a door I never went through before.\n\n\n \"Sorry we're late.\"\n\n\n When we reached the end of the aristocratic section of the temple, I saw the Head Priest standing in full armour ahead, and Arnaud standing beside him with the wand of the goddess of water, Freudorene. The Head Priest was covered with silver armour and held his helmet in his left hand. With a T-shaped nose shield and no fancy decoration, the helmet looked like a Corinthian one with only the eyes and mouth exposed after being worn. The blue cape complemented the silvery armour, giving the Head Priest a faint glow.\n\n\n Right in front of me was a high wall that seemed to shut off the world behind me, and a great gate that seemed impossible to open by man alone. They were both made of smooth stones, like the temple, and the midday sun shone on them, reflecting a dazzling white light.\n\n\n \"Is this ceremonial dress?\"\n\n\n When Fran put me down, the Head Priest looked me over from head to foot. Then he turned his forefinger, indicating that I should turn. I opened my arms and turned in place so that he could see the dress clearly.\n\n\n \"I seldom see such a pattern, but it is better than I expected.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest suddenly gave a gentle look and praised my ceremonial dress. Then he called, \"Arnaud.\" Hearing the call, Arnaud handed me something.\n\n\n \"Maine, you were born in the summer, weren't you? I'll lend you this, and you can wear it on your middle finger.\"\n\n\n The thing Arnaud handed me was a ring with an immense sapphire. I took the ring, which was obviously not my size, and thanked the Head Priest. \"Isn't it too big?\" Although I thought so, I put it on the middle finger of my left hand. The sapphire glowed at the touch of my finger, and the ring shrank to just the right size to fit on my finger.\n\n\n \"Whoa!\"\n\n\n \"Don't make a fuss about every little thing.\"\n\n\n \"But, but…\"\n\n\n It was impossible not to be surprised. To me, these were not \"little things\".\n\n\n The Head Priest must have lent me this ring because it would come in handy later.\n\n\n What kind of world are we heading for? Will it be a fantasy world where my common sense doesn't work at all?\n\n\n \"Wait where you are.\"\n\n\n So saying to us, the Head Priest clanged forward and raised his hands towards the great gate. As in the opening of the secret room of the Head Priest's Office, a huge glittering magic circle appeared in midair, and then the gate slowly opened before us. Although I had been used to seeing automatic doors in my previous life, it was the first time I saw a gate that opened automatically in this world, so I almost jumped in surprise.\n\n\n \"Oooh!\"\n\n\n \"You're acting too commoner. At least keep your mouth shut.\"\n\n\n I was indeed a commoner. I thought the Head Priest was really imposing on me. But Arnaud and Fran, as his attendants, seemed to take these things for granted. If this were the daily life of the aristocrats, the members of the Order would certainly look at me strangely if I continued to make such a fuss. So I started trying to control the corners of my mouth.\n\n\n \"Come on.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest walked to the gate, Arnaud at his heels. Fran, who once again picked me up, quickly followed.\n\n\n As soon as we passed through the gate, we came to the aristocratic quarter. Just a gate away, I was dumbstruck by how different the aristocratic quarter looked from the commoners' quarter I knew so well. Now before me was a square with a huge fountain, all paved with white flagstones. Instead of cramped houses and stinky air, there were endless white roads and green parks, and the ground was so unpolluted that I couldn't bear to set foot on it. This place might have been magically separated from the outside world, so even the air was different.\n\n\n In the square there was a group of knights, about twenty in number, dressed in silver armour like the Head Priest. The difference was that their capes were bright yellow. They must be members of the Order. Sensing that the gate was open, the knights gathered and lined up.\n\n\n \"Master Maine, please act like an aristocrat!\""

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Fran reminded me in a low voice that only I could hear. I nodded, smiling the elegant smile Rosina herself had imparted to me.\n\n\n Only the knight standing at the front had his helmet under his arm. He was a big, middle-aged man with reddish brown hair. I looked at him carefully, and found that he was agile in movement, upright in figure, and possessed the commanding air of a martial artist. When he had knelt before the Head Priest, the other knights knelt in unison with a clatter of armour.\n\n\n \"Lord Ferdinand, I'm glad you haven't changed a bit.\"\n\n\n \"Well, so are you, Castid.\"\n\n\n The man named Castid, who was talking to the Head Priest, must be the head of the Order.\n\n\n \"Why are there so few people?\"\n\n\n \"There are many who have not yet returned from the Harvest Festival.\"\n\n\n As if the Head Priest didn't want to ask any more questions, he answered 'Yes' and raised his hand to Fran. Fran put me down and gave me a gentle push on the back as a sign that I should move forward.\n\n\n \"Castid, this is Maine, the trainee priestess in charge of the ceremony. Please take good care of her.\"\n\n\n \"This is Maine, Lord Castid, and I would appreciate your advice.\"\n\n\n Castid was an aristocrat, so I knelt down respectfully and greeted him. When I caught his eye, his pale blue eyes narrowed as if to spy my thoughts.\n\n\n \"It's a pleasure to meet you.\"\n\n\n \"Let's go.\"\n\n\n With a voice from the Head Priest, all the knights rose at the same moment and touched the gem on the glove of their right hand. The next second, the gems were shining, and the square was instantly flooded with many animal statues. The gems on everyone's gloves had disappeared, leaving only round holes, which showed that these animals of various shapes had all been transformed from the gems on the gloves.\n\n\n \"Castid, get two men to carry my two attendants. Maine, you come here.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest put on his helmet as he instructed me. When I reached him, he picked me up and sat me down on a lion with wings. To keep steady, I straddled the lion. Then the Head Priest leaped upon the lion's back and grasped the reins, as lightly as if he were not wearing any heavy armour at all. The next moment the lion, which I thought was a statue, began to move like a living animal.\n\n\n \"Ah!\"\n\n\n This was really unexpected. I gave a sharp jolt, and the back of my head hit the Head Priest's chest hard.\n\n\n \"It hurts…\"\n\n\n \"Keep your mouth shut or you'll bite your tongue.\"\n\n\n I gritted my teeth and leaned forward a little, grasping the reins that swayed before my eyes. The winged lion ran lightly forward, then fluttered its wings and sprang into the air. On the way, I had the feeling that I had broken a thin spider web, but it was gone in a flash. The lion's wings beat powerfully and flew toward the commoners' quarter.\n\n\n \"Whoa, that's high…\"\n\n\n \"Don't you think it's scary?\"\n\n\n \"I was just surprised by something I had never seen before. And I can hardly feel any bumps now, so it's no more scary than riding in a carriage.\"\n\n\n I sat on the magical lion's back and felt like I was on a slow roller coaster. The lion was not so bumpy as the carriage, but very stable. The lack of a safety rope was very dangerous, but the Head Priest was sitting behind me holding the reins, and his arms were just holding me from either side, so I didn't find it scary at all.\n\n\n After a while, other animals began to appear around us, flying in neat formation like geese. Pegasus seemed to be very popular, because I found that they were the most numerous. As far as I could see, pegasus of different colors were flying gracefully, transforming the sky into a prairie. I also saw a few wolves and tigers, but I would say that the rabbits with wings were the loveliest.\n\n\n \"What are these animals, Head Priest?\"\n\n\n \"They are animal mounts from magic gems. They are free to be controlled as long as the owner gives them magic power. As for their form, it's up to the owner to decide.\"\n\n\n The lion flew over the commoners' quarter and then over the gate of the city. Looking down from the sky, I saw that the city was surrounded by fertile farmland and vast green forests. Between the farmland and forests, some streets winded their way into the distance, at the end of which the outer walls of other cities loomed.\n\n\n \"Where are we going, Head Priest?\"\n\n\n \"There.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest pointed to the forest where the orphans and I used to go, but where we were going now was deeper. It was the only place in the dense forest where there was a crater - like hole. As I gazed at the large hole, I saw that there was not even an ordinary plant there, except for a giant tree, whose long branches were waving and writhing restlessly. And as the tree's movements became more frantic, the hole grew larger.\n\n\n \"What's that?!\"\n\n\n \"It is the demon tree called Tronbay.\"\n\n\n \"Huh?! That's Tronbay?!\"\n\n\n The branch-waving Tronbay and the fast-growing tree I knew were so far apart that even seeing them with my own eyes, I couldn't identify them as the same thing. In retrospect, Lutz and other children in the commoners' quarter would rush to cut down a tree when they heard that it was Tronbay, and if it was a big one, the city would send more than half of its gatekeepers to deal with it. I had even heard that if the Tronbay was too big for the gatekeepers, the Order would have to be sent out. However, the magnitude of this Tronbay was beyond my imagination.\n\n\n … It was too horrible.\n\n\n When I first started making paper, I suggested planting Tronbay. Now I could see why Lutz was fuming at that suggestion.\n\n\n \"You won't come out until the Order has defeated it. It's a dangerous journey. Hide in the forest first.\"\n\n\n After the Order had destroyed the giant Tronbay, it was the job of the priests or priestesses to restore magic to the land that has been drained of it. This time because the Order was too small, the Head Priest had to help the Order before he could help me.\n\n\n … The Head Priest was truly omnipotent.\n\n\n The Head Priest let the lion land in an open field some distance from the hole, and the knights followed him.\n\n\n \"Maine, Fran and Arnaud, you three stand by here. Castid, send two men to protect them.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest leapt nimbly from the lion's back and turned to give Castid an order. Castid nodded and immediately selected two men.\n\n\n \"Damour, Skicossa, you two serve as their guards.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, your Excellency!\"\n\n\n Having accepted the task of guarding us, Damour and Skicossa jumped off the pegasus, and the pegasus disappeared. Two beams of light flew toward them, turning into gems and resetting themselves in the holes in the armour gloves.\n\n\n \"Thanks for giving me a ride.\"\n\n\n After thanking the knights who had given them a ride, Fran and Arnaud jumped off their animal mounts. Just as I was about to follow their example and leap from the lion's back in a handsome way, the Head Priest, as though reading my thoughts, stopped me with angry eyes.\n\n\n … I forgot I had to be elegant.\n\n\n I was reminded of where I was now, and I turned on the back of the lion, which had completely turned back into a statue, and waited with my legs folded. \"You are really…\" The Head Priest murmured as he took me from the lion's back.\n\n\n \"Protect the trainee priestess, don't let her get hurt.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest gave the word, and the two knights who were to be our guards answered at once, \"Yes!\"\n\n\n In the meantime, the giant hole created by Tronbay continued to grow. Out of the blue, a great flock of birds flapped up, and then there was a great crash of something falling, and the ground shook violently with it.\n\n\n \"Ah!\"\n\n\n I saw a big tree suddenly fall in the direction of Tronbay. Tronbay's roots then shot out of the soil and wrapped themselves tightly around the fallen tree. In a blink of an eye, the fallen tree's leaves were completely withered and its thick trunk shriveled. When the tree's nutrients had been drained, the roots sank back into the soil as if they had done their job.\n\n\n Tronbay was so scary… I broke out in cold sweat. As I looked from the crazy Tronbay to the Order about to fight it, I grew more uneasy and knelt in prayer.\n\n\n \"The Head Priest and all members of the Order, wish you all the best in this battle. May Angleff, the god of valour, protect you.\"\n\n\n As soon as I had finished my prayer, the ring the Head Priest had lent me shone blue on the Order. Sensing that the sapphire on the ring had taken away my magic power, I hastily suppressed it, so that its light vanished.\n\n\n \"The priestess has given us her blessing. Come on!\"\n\n\n When I heard that, I realized what I had done. I glanced up at the Head Priest, who was looking at me with a complex expression.\n\n\n \"Maine, do not, do not act before your turn.\"\n\n\n After the Head Priest left this instruction to me, he mounted the lion and flew up into the sky again."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"What a pointless blessing. How did she do such a stupid thing?\"\n\n\n As I looked up at the soaring knights, I overheard a scornful snort behind me.\n\n\n \"Skicossa, what are you talking about?!\"\n\n\n They were both wearing helmets and I couldn't see their faces, but I guessed that the one standing proudly was Skicossa and that the one stopping him was Damour. Judging by their voices, they were both very young. They were probably young adults and might even be minors.\n\n\n \"Am I wrong? It was foolish of her to bless the Order with her magic when there is a shortage of it everywhere.\"\n\n\n Skicossa pushed away Damour and pointed at me.\n\n\n \"It's true that the Order can never lose to Tronbay without a blessing, but it makes a big difference whether it has the blessing of Angleff, the god of valour. After all, there are so few men this time.\"\n\n\n I listened to their conversation with great anxiety. I only wished good luck to the knights who were about to fight the giant Tronbay, and when I said something that I thought would not sound strange to aristocrats, it somehow turned out to be a blessing. I was startled to see the ring suddenly glow. It probably wouldn't have turned out to be a blessing if the Head Priest hadn't lent me the ring, so it was just an accident.\n\n\n … Perhaps the Head Priest was startled too.\n\n\n And, although Skicossa said it was a waste of magic, I stopped as soon as I noticed that the sapphire on the ring was absorbing it, so it wouldn't have any effect on the ceremony.\n\n\n \"I'm awfully sorry if I've upset you. I'll be more careful about my behaviour in the future.\"\n\n\n I kept my rebuttal to myself and apologized at once to prevent the situation from becoming troublesome. Skicossa only snorted, but I hoped that would be the end of the matter.\n\n\n \"You don't have to worry about what Skicossa just said. There are not many of us right now, and we're grateful for your blessing… Look, the battle has begun.\"\n\n\n Damour said to me thoughtfully, pointing to the sky. Following his finger tip, knights circling in the air now and then flashed through the gaps between the trees. What exactly are they going to do to defeat Tronbay as a monster? I stood on tiptoe and watched them.\n\n\n \"——————!\"\n\n\n In midair came the voice of the Head Priest. All I knew was that he shouted a command, but I didn't catch it at all. After the command, a black mist rose from each knight's hand, and out of the mist came shining weapons.\n\n\n \"Fran, do you know what that is?\"\n\n\n \"I don't know. It's the first time I've ever seen a knights battle up close.\"\n\n\n The Order was usually accompanied to the battle by two priests, one carrying the wand and performing the ceremony, and the other providing magical support, so the attendants never followed, Fran said. But this time the Head Priest had to fight with the Order, and I could not carry the wand, which was twice my height, and Fran had to take care of me. With these three points in mind, the two attendants were able to come.\n\n\n \"It's a weapon blessed by the god of darkness, trainee priestess. The enemy loses a lot of magic when attacked by such a weapon, so it is indispensable in the crusade against Tronbay.\"\n\n\n I had not expected an aristocrat to act as a narrator for me, so I looked up at Damour in his metal armour with some surprise. I could only see his mouth in the shadow of his helmet, but I had no sense that he discriminated against me as a commoner.\n\n\n \"Very few people can see a knight in action. Enjoy it.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you very much.\"\n\n\n \"It starts with shooting to weaken Tronbay. You see, that blue cape is Lord Ferdinand.\"\n\n\n In the direction Damour was pointing, a knight was sitting astride a lion, drawing his bow. His posture was very similar to that of horseback archery. All the capes fluttered in the wind, and in a patch of bright yellow, only one was blue.\n\n\n … That is the Head Priest! He is so cool! Come on!\n\n\n In order to maintain my dignity, I could not shout at will, but in my heart I tried desperately to cheer on the Head Priest. Though I was too far away to see the bowstring, I could tell from the movements of his arms and the black arrow that flew out that he had fired. With a wheeze, the arrow burst through the air, splintering into myriads of tiny arrows, raining down on the giant Tronbay. The spots where the arrows had struck gleamed, and then a series of small explosions were heard, but Tronbay seemed completely oblivious to the scale of the attack and continued to brandished branches.\n\n\n \"It takes quite a bit of magic to make an arrow rain like that. It's impressive that Lord Ferdinand can even do it several times, isn't it?\"\n\n\n In a tone of adoration, Damour explained to me what was so wonderful about the Head Priest. He evidently held him in great esteem.\n\n\n \"If only Lord Ferdinand would rejoin the Order soon…\"\n\n\n I blinked in bewilderment as Damour blurted out this remark in a long speech in praise of the Head Priest. Seeing me looking up at him, he whispered after an awkward silence:\n\n\n \"… it's a secret.\"\n\n\n \"Got it. I won't tell.\"\n\n\n I had heard from the Head Priest that he was not born and raised in the temple, but I had no idea that he had ever served in the Order. No wonder he and Castid seemed to have known each other for so long, even their armour was identical. He was a slender man, with a sensitive personality, and the appearance and temperament of a man at ease with his room. It was inconceivable that he ever served in the Order. But he didn't strike me at all as a discordant note in this battle symphony.\n\n\n … As an aristocrat, he was not only proficient in literature and martial arts, but also proficient in the art of music. He really could do anything.\n\n\n I wish I could spare some of his abilities. So I thought, and looked up at the Head Priest. His blue cape fluttered in the wind like a flag, and arrows, driven by his magic, rained down on Tronbay.\n\n\n \"It's working. Tronbay is turning black. Can you see it?\"\n\n\n It was true, as Damour had said, that tiny black spots had begun to appear where the arrows of the Head Priest had struck. And as the arrows rained down, their numbers grew.\n\n\n \"I can see it. Ah, the branches…\"\n\n\n As if corroded from the black spots, the surprisingly powerful branches suddenly broke and fell. The broken branches turned into firefly lights and disappeared.\n\n\n Tronbay stretched its movable branches, trying to knock the knights out of the air, but failed to hit them who could fly at will. Instead, the knights seized the opportunity to counterattack and impaled the brandishing branches with black weapons that seemed to be a combination of axe and lance. The branches that were under attack all turned black and thumped down.\n\n\n I didn't know how many branches had fallen, but by the time I noticed, the Tronbay hole had stopped expanding, and the number of branches flailing had decreased. The knights cut through the dying remains of the branches and began to attack its trunk directly. The trunk was huge and strong, but it was already dotted with black spots. Tronbay gradually lost its life under the continuous attacks.\n\n\n \"It's almost over.\"\n\n\n Whispered Damour, who seemed relieved. I had been worried about how to defeat the giant Tronbay when I saw how dangerous it was, but now that it was coming to an end in such a short time, I could not help but sigh with relief with Damour.\n\n\n \"I was worried about what would happen to the knights fighting such a demon tree, but I was relieved they didn't seem to be hurt.\"\n\n\n \"Tronbay comes out every year, so after all these battles, even though the Order is small, it's never lost. And this time with Lord Ferdinand's help, even killing the branches was very easy.\"\n\n\n Damour said the arrow rain of the Head Priest greatly increased the effectiveness of the crusade against Tronbay. If too few men were able to attack Tronbay from a distance while avoiding its attack, it would be slow to weaken it, so each time a few knights would be hit by brandishing branches.\n\n\n I couldn't see Damour's face, but his voice was gentle. So I looked up at him with a smile on my face, but suddenly there was a grunt of displeasure behind me.\n\n\n \"Why are you so close to a commoner, Damour? Don't you know? She's a commoner. It's arrogant of her, a commoner, to wear a blue robe that only an aristocrat can wear. What was Lord Ferdinand thinking? It's true that the number of aristocrats is now greatly reduced, but that is not a reason enough for a commoner to wear a blue robe.\"\n\n\n \"Skicossa, what are you talking about… Please don't talk nonsense.\""

The next day, Lutz said he wanted to make cheese as well as gelatin and candles.\n\n\n Our family bought milk from herdsmen, but we only made cottage cheese with vinegar, and Lutz’s family kept eggs and milk and turned them into cheese.\n\n\n \"Cheese is easy to keep, so it's a good idea to have some for the orphanage.\"\n\n\n \"… I don't quite understand, but if only there would be more food in the winter.\"\n\n\n Lutz and Gil discussed these things as they worked. I had to practice the Fespeil until the third bell, so by the time I got to the workshop it was almost the fourth. As I walked around the workshop with Fran, I saw the gray-robed priests and the apprentices working together on different assignments. I seldom visited the workshop at this time, so now I felt very fresh.\n\n\n \"Lutz, Gil, how are things?\"\n\n\n \"It's all going well. The pig skins are being processed here, the candles are being made there, and now the priests are melting the tallow and filtering out the mince. The so-called salting out hasn't been done yet.\"\n\n\n The pot in front of Lutz and Gil was full of lime water, and the pig skins were soaking in it. It looked like they were just been soaking in, so there was no sign of expansion at the moment. In the direction Lutz was pointing, three gray-robed priests were filtering melted tallow.\n\n\n \"Let's soak the pig skins for a while. Salting out is a little troublesome, but it will reduce the smell and improve the quality of the oil. Come on, everybody.\"\n\n\n Lutz's family never salted out, and mine tried it at my suggestion, but only officially adopted it when they found out that the smell had really faded. Salting out was not common here. Part of the reason, I thought, was that I lived in a slum, and while salt was not as expensive as other spices, it was still hard to afford.\n\n\n \"Two herbs, Dyenb and Rumoza, can be added to melted wax to get rid of the stench. But you mustn't add Gajeli and Sarukoleyle, they'll only get stinker.\"\n\n\n Lutz snickered when I told him about ways to reduce the stench of making candles.\n\n\n \"Ah, are these examples of your failures?\"\n\n\n \"Alas… failure is the mother of success. After several failures, success is sure to follow.\"\n\n\n \"Oh… I see. Master Maine is marvelous.\"\n\n\n Gil's eyes sparkled as I spoke, and he nodded his head cunningly in agreement with what I said. He was so honest and lovely. I hoped he could just grow up like this.\n\n\n \"By the way, Master Maine, what is salting out? Is it difficult?\"\n\n\n \"It's just a few more steps. It's troublesome, but not difficult. All we need to do is pour the brine into the tallow, simmer for a while, and then remove the residue. As it cools, the tallow separates into the oil that floats on top and the brine that sinks below. When the oil has set to white, pour away the brine, leaving the oil on top.\"\n\n\n I explained the steps briefly, and Gil nodded his head as he listened. Lutz listened too, but all of a sudden he blinked.\n\n\n \"Maine, don't you save some of it for the soap?\"\n\n\n \"The Grace of God includes soap, so it can all be used for candles.\"\n\n\n My family made soap every spring, so we always saved some of the oil. But the temple would provide soap as part of the Grace of God. The priests and priestesses had to keep their clothes and bodies clean, so soap was provided in abundance. Although from the orphanage's point of view, we wanted ingredients more than soap, the priests and priestesses' priorities were different from ours.\n\n\n \"Ah, Gil, there must be a lot of mince in the cloth we used to filter the tallow. It will be good to add to tonight's soup. Please tell the gray-robed priests about it.\"\n\n\n Gil nodded vigorously and ran to the priests who were filtering the tallow. The priests unrolled the filter cloth and looked at it carefully. Then they shouted happily, \"There is meat on it!\"\n\n\n \"Well, meat is important, after all.\"\n\n\n Lutz and I looked at each other and smiled. Then I looked around the workshop and saw that in addition to making gelatins and candles, there were also gray-robed priests and apprentices using presses to extract oil from the fruit. This oil could be used not only as lamp oil, but also for cooking. I hoped to extract as much as possible, but unfortunately, the orphanage usually only made soup.\n\n\n The usual protagonist, the paper, was now stacked in the corner. By the wall I saw half-finished paper, still wet, and white and black bark hanging out to dry. Finally, my eyes rested on the paper that had been made and piled up.\n\n\n \"Lutz, how much paper does the workshop have now?\"\n\n\n Lutz followed my gaze and narrowed his eyes.\n\n\n \"We just printed the picture books a while ago, so it should be under 300 now. I won't know the exact number until those half-finished ones are finished. Do you need paper?\"\n\n\n \"Well, I'm going to reprint the Children's Edition of the Scripture. But I don't want to waste paper templates, so I'd like to print a lot in one go, so there's a huge demand for paper… How much paper can we make if we start now?\"\n\n\n As for pigments, I had ordered linseed oil from Benno, and there was still plenty of soot left. So right now, the most urgent need was paper.\n\n\n \"Although tuckahoe is not suitable for firewood, the bark is beginning to harden in this season. I will ask the wood shop. If all the bark in the workshop were made into paper, there would be about 750 pieces.\"\n\n\n \"Really? Please make as much paper as you can.\"\n\n\n \"Leave it to me.\"\n\n\n When Lutz took the job, I stopped worrying about paper.\n\n\n \"If you have time, Maine, would you like to see how the cheese is made?\"\n\n\n I nodded to Lutz's suggestion and moved with Fran to the ground floor of the girls' dormitory.\n\n\n \"Is the cheese made in the girls' dormitory?\"\n\n\n In my opinion, it was not acceptable for a pot cooked with ashes and bark to be used for making food, but here, many people assumed that it was ok to wash the pot after cooking something other than food. It would not affect the taste of the food, but I didn't want to.\n\n\n \"It's done!\"\n\n\n \"Let's put this in the sun next.\"\n\n\n When we arrived at the girls' dormitory, we found children airing fruits and mushrooms picked from the forest and gray-robed priestesses working hard to make cheese and soup. The fruit and honey were bubbling in the pot, and a delicious jam was about to be born. The air was thick with sweet smells, and compared with the stinking boys' dormitory, it was a paradise of sweets and cakes.\n\n\n \"But even after all this soup, it was all gone by noon.\"\n\n\n \"I hope the Harvest Festival will be over soon. It's tiring to have to cook so many times a day.\"\n\n\n During the Harvest Festival, when the Grace of God was much less, the priestesses who in charge of the soup were kept busy and needed to make nearly twice as much soup as usual. They were either pouting as they cut or grinning as they stirred the soup. Seeing how they looked, I couldn't help laughing.\n\n\n \"Ah, Master Maine!\"\n\n\n Seeing me coming, the children stopped their work in a hurry, crossed their hands and bowed to me. Heard me say, \"Get back to work, everyone.\" They resumed their work in a very stiff motion, completely different from the way they had been when they had not noticed me.\n\n\n … Ah, they were all scared of me.\n\n\n Because I had to go to the workshop a lot to discuss things with Lutz and to check on new projects, the priests who worked there would not be nervous about seeing me now. But I had never made an appearance at the girls' dormitory at this hour, and I could tell they were all shaking with nervousness.\n\n\n \"Lutz told me you were making cheese, so I just came by to look around. Is everything all right?\"\n\n\n \"We are heating the milk.\"\n\n\n The priestess gave a stiff smile as she slowly stirred the milk in the pot with a large wooden spatula. Lutz looked into the pot and nodded slightly.\n\n\n \"Keep heating until the milk starts to bubble.\"\n\n\n Probably able to calculate the time after looking at the situation, Lutz muttered, \"That should be fine,\" then called out to the children airing the fruit.\n\n\n \"Hey, children, I'm going back to the Company. I'll have things delivered in batches. Please go to the workshop and wait.\"\n\n\n The children answered in unison, stopping to air the fruit and starting to prepare the baskets.\n\n\n \"Maine, I think you should go back to your room. Everyone is nervous with you around.\"\n\n\n \"Well, I see. Then, please keep an eye on it.\"\n\n\n Seeing that all the work was going well, I returned to the Dean's Office with great satisfaction. In this case, we should be able to get everything done before the blue-robed priests and priestesses came back. With the exception of stinky work, everything else was less urgent.\n\n\n As well as preparing three meals as usual, the kitchen was busy today with the marinating and oil sealing of large quantities of pork that had been sliced and not yet smoked the day before. I watched the frantic kitchen as I made my way up to the first floor. Delia was practicing her writing against the Children's Edition of the Scripture, and Rosina was handling the tasks assigned to her by Fran.\n\n\n \"Shall we go on making paper templates then?\"\n\n\n I tried to get to work too, but Fran smiled and handed me a board.\n\n\n \"No, Master Maine, you may as well revise your prayers as your paper templates. You must expect a request from the Order at any moment.\"\n\n\n The Order must be assembled from a group of aristocrats, so no mistake, not even the slightest one, should be made in receiving a request from it. Fran was clearly more worried about the request from the Order than winter preparations for the orphanage.\n\n\n \"… when will the Order make its request?\"\n\n\n \"There is no specific time, but normally before winter they would make one or two requests, so it might not be long.\"\n\n\n \"Well…\"\n\n\n By convention, the trainee priests and priestesses would never be present at ceremonies, as no one would wish to have an important ceremony performed by an immature trainee. Therefore, I never attended the baptisms, the coming-of-age ceremonies, and star-union ceremonies at the temple as a blue-robed priestess. The Order's members were mostly men, and too much contact with them by the priestesses could lead to gossip, so requests from the Order were always addressed by the grown-up blue-robed priests. Now, however, the number of competent priests was obviously not enough, and it was me who was the least fit to take on the task.\n\n\n \"But, Fran, I don't quite understand. The Head Priest has a lot of magic, doesn't he?\"\n\n\n Besides me, surely there was another who was fit for it -- the Head Priest.\n\n\n \"On such occasions, he must prioritize the duties of an aristocrat over those of a priest.\"\n\n\n Not only was the temple undernumbered, so was the Order. Knights who performed well were promoted to the centre, just like the priests and priestesses of the temple. As a result, the Order was forced to recruit aristocrats whose magic was not strong enough to pass. In such a case, it was possible that the Head Priest, as an old school aristocrat who had graduated from the Aristocrats Academy, would come to the aid of the Order, and would therefore require me to perform the ritual of the Order as a priestess. This was what Fran told me in private.\n\n\n … I was finally able to do something like a priestess, but my first task was a request from the Order. Wasn't that a bit too much of a burden?\n\n\n As I recited the prayer through a cold sweat, Fran looked up as if he thought of something.\n\n\n \"Is your ceremonial dress ready, Master Maine?\"\n\n\n \"The fitting is over, and the formal work is under way, so it should be done before long.\"\n\n\n Corinna had said that if she was in good health it would take about four days, and even if she was not, it should take less than ten days. When I told Fran that, he was relieved.\n\n\n \"Please bring it to the temple as soon as possible, so that when requested, you may set out immediately.\"\n\n\n Then Fran joined me in reciting the prayers, and presently Gil returned with a wooden box, which seemed to have been delivered by the Gilberta Company.\n\n\n \"Fran, can you give me a hand? There are some big packages out there.\"\n\n\n \"I see. Delia and Rosina, please open this box first. Master Maine, please stay here and continue reciting.\"\n\n\n At Gil's call, Fran stood up and went downstairs, and Rosina and Delia followed him.\n\n\n \"Wow! The blankets are here!\"\n\n\n From downstairs came a loud cry of excitement from Delia. She liked to decorate rooms best.\n\n\n \"That way, the Dean's Office will be ready for the winter, too. I'll change the decorations immediately…\"\n\n\n \"Delia, lunch is coming soon. You can start after lunch.\"\n\n\n Rosina checked the impetuous Delia. So we decided to change the decorations this afternoon.\n\n\n \"Now, Master Maine, go to the workshop with Gil.\"\n\n\n Just after lunch, Delia ushered me out of the room, all smiles. The Head Priest was away at the Harvest Festival, so I could not enter the library, even with Fran. I could neither go to the library nor stay in the Dean's Office, so I had no choice but to go to the workshop. Delia said I couldn't take Fran, a scarce labour force, and in the end, I was piteously escorted to the workshop by Gil.\n\n\n \"Lutz said this morning that the pig skins were quite swollen, and would like you to see them. Master Maine, come with me to the workshop.\"\n\n\n Probably the others had not finished their meal, so there was not a single person in the workshop. Since no one would stop me, I ventured to take a closer look at the pot.\n\n\n \"… huh? Maine, what are you doing here?\"\n\n\n While I was looking at the pig skins in the pot, Lutz suddenly came back. I guessed he have had lunch at the Company and reported to Benno about his work for the day. As soon as he walked in the door, he saw me who wasn't supposed to be here, so his eyes widened in surprise. My position prevented me from doing anything myself, and it was a rarity for me to come to the workshop several times a day.\n\n\n \"The Company has brought in all that carpet stuff, so Delia is having a good time changing the decorations… She threw me out because I was in the way.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, that's just right. My master wants me to tell you that the ceremonial dress is ready and that you can go to Mrs. Corinna when you have time. Since you can't stay in your room, do you want to go to Mrs. Corinna now? I'll pick you up when you leave.\"\n\n\n I nodded at Lutz's suggestion. It was autumn now, and the weather was getting colder every day. I would catch a fever sooner or later if I stayed out like this. If there was a place to hide, I'd better get there quickly.\n\n\n \"Good. Then I will take Rosina to Mrs. Corinna. When you come to fetch me, remember to bring Fran with you. I can't let Rosina come back alone.\"\n\n\n \"I see.\"\n\n\n \"Lutz, please wash the pig skins. I will bring Master Maine back to the temple.\"\n\n\n When Gil and I returned to the Dean's Office, Delia was moving the large furniture. Seeing us come in, she bellowed, \"This is a mess that is not to be seen by the master, so you are not to come in until I have finished cleaning!\"\n\n\n \"I have heard that the ceremonial dress is ready, so I'm going to see it and then go straight home. At least let me change my clothes. And Rosina, will you come with me to Mrs. Corinna?\"\n\n\n \"At your command.\"\n\n\n Rosina went to change her clothes for the outing. \"I'll have the room ready by tomorrow.\" Said Delia, beaming as she dressed me quickly.\n\n\n \"Fran, Lutz will call you before he returns to the Company. Please go with him. We can't let Rosina go back to the temple alone after dark.\"\n\n\n \"At your command, Master Maine. Be careful. I look forward to your early return.\"\n\n\n With Fran's eyes on us, Rosina and I walked down the main road, where the sun was still warm but the wind was already cold. She looked exceptionally beautiful in her new rouge dress. Fran had been shuttling me between the Gilberta Company and my house, and Gil went to the forest from time to time, but Rosina, unlike them, had little opportunity to go outside. She frowned at the smell of the street, but at the same time looked around curiously, making me think she was lovely.\n\n\n \"If only Wilma could come out and walk around, she would be able to draw more things…\"\n\n\n \"Maybe in the near future, Wilma will want to go out, too. In the old days, when she was making soup on the ground floor, she would hide away in fear when the gray-robed priests came to help carry the water. But now she even has the courage to give them instructions.\"\n\n\n Now that Wilma was in charge of the orphanage, she must be stronger than ever. After listening to Rosina's report, I could feel that little by little, Wilma was changing.\n\n\n \"Good afternoon, Mr. Mark. I heard that Mr. Benno wanted me, and I came here as soon as I could.\"\n\n\n \"My master is on business. I will speak directly to Mrs. Corinna. Please wait here.\"\n\n\n As I sat down under Mark's invitation, Rosina stood quietly behind me. An apprentice followed Mark's instructions and brought me tea. I took a sip of it and let out a long breath.\n\n\n \"This way, Master Maine.\"\n\n\n Rosina was here today, and I was Corinna's guest, so Mark rarely addressed me as \"Master\". We went up the back stairs to the second floor.\n\n\n \"Mrs. Corinna, Master Maine is here.\"\n\n\n \"Maine, welcome.\"\n\n\n When Mark knocked at the door, Corinna came out to meet us with a soft smile. She seemed surprised when her eyes fell on Rosina.\n\n\n \"Is your attendant with you today? Shall I call you Master Maine then?\"\n\n\n \"I don't really care, but please call me 'Master' for Rosina's feeling.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, then, Master Maine, please come in.\"\n\n\n We followed Corinna into the anteroom, where my ceremonial dress hung directly in front of the entrance.\n\n\n \"Wow!\"\n\n\n The ceremonial dress was placed where the sun shined, so water ripples and embroidered flowers stood out. Against the light, the cloth glowed with a gorgeous sheen, as if it had real water flowing over it. I was dumbfounded at the stunning beauty.\n\n\n \"… it's so beautiful.\"\n\n\n Rosina's admiration brought me to my senses.\n\n\n \"Mrs. Corinna, this is a marvelous dress. Thank you very much.\"\n\n\n \"I'm the one who should say thank you.\"\n\n\n With a smile, and holding her enlarged belly, Corinna removed the ceremonial dress with a very careful movement.\n\n\n \"Please try it on. I am sorry, but I am a little clumsy now, so may I ask you to help Master Maine to change?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, of course.\"\n\n\n Rosina took the dress from Corinna and put it on for me. As a high attendant who had served a noble daughter, Rosina dressed me in a fluid and graceful manner. The main color of the dress was blue, and most of the embroidery was of the same color, but silver thread was used on the cuffs and hem, and gold one on the chest. The pattern embroidered in gold thread was the emblem of Maine Workshop, which perfectly decorated the empty space.\n\n\n I stood at attention nervously, feeling as if I had put on a coming-of-age kimono with long sleeves. I must be dignified and elegant. On no account should I get my clothes dirty. I couldn't get these thoughts out of my head.\n\n\n \"The belt is here.\"\n\n\n \"Underage trainee blue-robed priests and priestesses must wear a white belt with silver embroidery. When they become adults, silver embroidery will be replaced by gold embroidery. These embroideries are prayers in the Scripture.\" Corinna explained.\n\n\n \"Excuse me, why is the cloth of this ceremonial dress so thick?\"\n\n\n Rosina adjusted my belt and looked up at Corinna. Corinna, still smiling attractively, explained to her the special technique used in the dress.\n\n\n \"By folding and stitching the cloth like this, you can adjust the length of the dress according to the height… I actually did it according to Master Maine's request. It's very rare, but the ceremonial dress is not widely worn, so it makes sense.\"\n\n\n \"…Master Maine always surprises me.\"\n\n\n After hearing that this was not Corinna's original craft, but my proposal, Rosina sighed with understanding. After getting dressed for me, Rosina stood up and checked from all angles, then nodded vigorously.\n\n\n \"The dress is excellent, Master Maine. The flowers look so lifelike in your movements. I am sure the eyes will follow you in spite of themselves.\"\n\n\n Because of the new technique used in the ceremonial dress, Corinna seemed unsure of how it would work. She was relieved to hear that Rosina, who had served Lady Christine, had given such a high evaluation.\n\n\n My ceremonial dress was ready and my room was rearranged. The food and candles had been processed, and the wood had been moved into the basement. The gelatin had been placed in an airy space, and the workshop had made lots of paper and ink for subsequent picture books. All kinds of tools had been bought. In this way, the orphanage's winter preparations were finally completed."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n I tried to raise my left hand as high as I could to keep the blood from dripping, and shouted for help. Almost at the same moment the ring gave off a blue light, which shot straight into the sky.\n\n\n Then I heard the sound of wings and something was falling from the sky. Boom! I felt a slight impact from the soles of my feet. I tried to look down and saw that there were many black arrows at my feet, and Tronbay stopped as if it had lost its strength.\n\n\n \"Head Priest!\"\n\n\n Seeing the familiar arrows, I looked up again. The winged lion was coming down straight for me. With the arrows of the Head Priest, I had no more to worry about.\n\n\n But that was just my wishful thinking. Tronbay stayed quiet for only a few seconds, and after absorbing my dripping blood, it grew fast again. From my waist to my belly, from my belly to my chest, I felt the branches slowly climbing over me. Fear seized me again.\n\n\n \"Head Priest, hurry…\"\n\n\n The lion glided to the ground and the Head Priest sprang down. He rushed towards me with a long black bow in his hand.\n\n\n \"Maine, how did this happen?!\"\n\n\n \"Priestess, sorry to keep you waiting!\"\n\n\n Perhaps the god of darkness had finally answered his prayer, Damuel wielded his black knife and began to try to save me. The effect of his knife, however, could not be more different from that of the black arrows of the Head Priest. No matter how he attacked, Tronbay didn't stop.\n\n\n \"How did blessings not work?!\"\n\n\n \"It's not that the blessing didn't work, it's that Tronbay recovered in an instant! Why?!\"\n\n\n After being struck by the arrows, Tronbay only stopped for a moment and immediately resumed his activities. Though its growth slowed, it showed no sign of withering. The Head Priest continued to shoot black arrows at it in disbelief.\n\n\n \"Head Priest, it is blood. It is my blood that makes it…\"\n\n\n \"Your blood?!\" \"After I told him why Tronbay was growing so fast, he suddenly raised his voice. I couldn't see his face, but I could tell by this alone that his eyes must have widened.\n\n\n \"What do you think I was doing to keep you out of the battle? I even sent guards to protect you! Thoes guards are useless fools!\"\n\n\n These words were uttered angrily by the Head Priest, and they severely rebuked the two knights who had been left to guard me. Now Damuel was fighting Tronbay with a knife, and Skicossa was trying to get the blessing of the god of darkness. After all, it was Skicossa who ignored the order of the Head Priest and threatened me, who was supposed to be protected, that led to this situation, so the Head priest was absolutely right.\n\n\n Moreover, after listening to the complaints of the Head Priest as he attacked Tronbay, I knew that my blood contained considerable magic. Not only Damuel, he muttered, but even half the knights with blessed weapons would not be able to save me.\n\n\n \"There is no point in our attacking Tronbay now. We must stop the bleeding first. Where is your wound, Maine?!\"\n\n\n \"Here.\"\n\n\n I tried to stretch my left hand. At the sight of the wound, the Head Priest groaned and whispered a spell: \"Interverrugu.\"\n\n\n His black bow turned back into a wand. Then he muttered another spell and waved his wand, and a jet of red light shot skyward. The red light was probably a signal, because I noticed that other knights coming when they saw it.\n\n\n \"What comes next will hurt, but you mustn't cry. Tears, like blood, have a magical power.\"\n\n\n As he reminded me, he ran his wand slowly over my wound. As soon as the wand, which emitted a dim glow, touched the wound, my body shuddered.\n\n\n \"Ah!\"\n\n\n A sense of conflict and pain as someone else's magic forced its way into my body made me tremble. My eyes involuntarily welled up physical tears. I looked up and kept breathing deeply, trying not to let the tears fall. I felt the wound begin to burn. The magic in me began to flow into the wound, fighting with the magic the Head Priest had injected into me, making it glint a yellowish light. As the light faded, the blood stopped.\n\n\n \"My wound…\"\n\n\n \"This first aid is only going to stop the bleeding for a while. Your wound is not healing. Releasing magic around Tronbay would be like committing suicide, but there's nothing else I can do.\"\n\n\n Thus said the Head Priest, in his exhaustion. My wound was no longer bleeding, but Tronbay was more alive than ever.\n\n\n \"Head Priest…\"\n\n\n \"In order to stop the bleeding, I have lost the blessing of the god of darkness, so I have no weapon against Tronbay. Rescue should have come…\"\n\n\n Said the Head Priest, looking up into the air, and shouting at the knights who were coming this way: \"Too slow!\". He had always been so aristocratic that he never showed any real emotion outside the Secret Room, so it made me shiver to hear him roar now.\n\n\n \"Lord Ferdinand, that signal for help… What happened?!\"\n\n\n As soon as the knights landed, they were stunned by what they saw.\n\n\n \"Castid, it's the incompetence of the guards you chose that caused this! Save Maine now! I had lost my blessing to stop her bleeding, and now had no weapon against Tronbay. The branches are about to wrap around her neck. Hurry up!\"\n\n\n \"Yes!\"\n\n\n With no weapon to confront Tronbay, the Head Priest turned aside to make way for the knights. Knights in metal armour charged with black weapons and stormed it. Explosions rang out all around me, sending up clouds of dust and debris.\n\n\n I began to cough uncontrollably.\n\n\n \"Don't hurt Maine, Castid! Her blood will make good food for Tronbay!\"\n\n\n The Head Priest gave his order and walked slowly to Skicossa and the attendants. I could only see his back, but there was no need for expressions or eyes to convey his burning anger.\n\n\n Although it was Skicossa who was at fault, he was an aristocrat of high standing. Under the rigid class system of this world, will I in the end bear all the responsibility? At any rate, will they punish or question me, as my blood has caused this unexpected battle?\n\n\n … It's possible.\n\n\n My mood darkened as I thought of what might happen next. The knights gathered around me, attacking the roots of Tronbay without a moment's rest.\n\n\n \"… the blessing begins to take effect.\"\n\n\n Damuel sighed with relief. Because the wound on the back of my hand no longer bled, Tronbay lost its nourishment and stopped growing.\n\n\n As a result of being attacked by weapons with the blessing of the god of darkness, the Tronbay around me began to wither, just like the giant Tronbay. Freed from the fear of strangulation, I settled for a moment.\n\n\n \"Oh, it's really hard to use!\"\n\n\n \"Damuel, you're the only one here with a knife. Be careful!\"\n\n\n It seemed that the blessed weapon could not change its form, and so it fell to Damuel with the knife to cut the branches around my neck, while the other knights had to slowly and deliberately cut the surrounding branches with the large weapons they had used in their crusade against the giant Tronbay.\n\n\n \"Damuel, trainee priestess… is your name Maine? How did this happen? It's the first time I've seen Lord Ferdinand so angry.\"\n\n\n Castid asked me in a low voice as he cut a branch at my feet.\n\n\n \"Well……\"\n\n\n Damuel turned his head to look at Skicossa. But he seemed unwilling to tell on Skicossa, and for a long time he faltered and said nothing. I felt an inexpressible restlessness at his ambivalence.\n\n\n How harsh the class system was here!\n\n\n The branches around my neck had been cleared away, so it would not be difficult to tell the truth in my present state, but whether Castid believed me or not was another matter. In a world where status was everything, I didn't know how much he would hear or believe what I say as a commoner. After all, he was also an aristocrat.\n\n\n … What should I do?\n\n\n \"I must know the truth. Come on!\"\n\n\n Castid, driven by our silence, urged us through gritted teeth.\n\n\n Then I remembered that the Head Priest had said to him angrily: \"Castid, it's the incompetence of the guards you chose that caused this!\" He was now anxious to know, in order to save himself, why the Head Priest was so angry; perhaps he would listen to me.\n\n\n \"If I tell you what happened, Lord Castid, will you keep me safe?\"\n\n\n I asked gingerly, also wanting to make sure that Skicossa was behaving in a way that was acceptable to the aristocrats. At least they wouldn't suddenly kill me before the ceremony had done, I figured. At last I made up my mind to speak to Castid. \"Even if I confess everything,\" I said, \"would an aristocrat be allowed to seize me by the hair, throw me to the ground, and threaten to gouge out my eyes with a knife, if I displeased him?\"\n\n\n \"What do you mean?… did you do these things to her?!\"\n\n\n Castid took off his helmet with a loud clang, and showed his angry face. He glanced sharply at Damuel, who seemed frightened and began to defend himself with all his might.\n\n\n \"It wasn't me! It was Skicossa who threatened her with a knife. I wanted to help her, but Skicossa wanted me to remember who I was…\"\n\n\n \"Idiot! No wonder Lord Ferdinand was furious!\"\n\n\n Castid tore off the branches that had become extremely fragile. The branches cracked with a clatter. It seemed that not only the Head Priest, but Also Castid was angry at the guards' behavior. In this case, even if I had told the truth, I should not have been suddenly hacked to death. I made my own judgment and turned to face Castid's pale blue eyes, which were brimming with anger.\n\n\n \"Speak quickly, Maine. But you must swear to the gods that you will speak the truth without any falsehood.\"\n\n\n \"I see, Lord Castid. I swear to the gods that there will not be a lie in what I say next.\"\n\n\n \"Wait a minute…\" Damuel interrupted me, but Castid pushed him aside. Convinced that Castid was serious about hearing my story, I gave a full account of what the two guards had done, and stated that the attendants, who were present at the time, could testify for me.\n\n\n It took the Order quite a long time to get me out of the tangle of branches without hurting me, so long that I could not get out of it until I had told all the details.\n\n\n \"Hey, are you okay?\"\n\n\n \"I don't think I'm okay. Call my attendant, please.\"\n\n\n It was a long time before I was free again. I looked as miserable as a lamb. My new ceremonial dress had been torn, and the blood-stained cloth was riddled as if it had been corroded. I felt pain all over my body, and probably because I had fought so hard, I couldn't muster any strength.\n\n\n \"Where is the attendant of the trainee priestess?!\""

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Castid hoisted me onto his shoulder when I could no longer stand. The knights were shoveling away the roots of Tronbay, and I thought it might affect them if I lay out like this. The impact of the metal armour made the pain worse, but I had no strength left to complain.\n\n\n \"Master Maine!\"\n\n\n Fran came at me like a departing arrow. As soon as Castid put me down, I fell limp over Fran.\n\n\n \"Master Maine has a fever, Head Priest!\"\n\n\n \"That's not surprising. Give her a good rest and some medicine. She must have lost a lot of magic after all that blood loss and being tangled in the branches.\"\n\n\n At the end of Skicossa's confession, the Head Priest gave me only a glance and soon looked ahead again. Without the helmet, I could see his face clearly now. He seemed even angrier than before.\n\n\n \"At your command.\"\n\n\n Fran helped me move to a warm spot in the sun. After I sat down, he took a small bottle of light green liquid out of his bag.\n\n\n \"Please take this medicine, Master Maine. It is made by the Head Priest.\"\n\n\n Although I dared not drink something strange, but if I didn't obey, the medicine might be forced into my mouth. Reluctantly, I reached for the bottle, but my hands, which I had raised so desperately to keep the blood from dripping, were now as heavy as lead and could not be lifted.\n\n\n \"No. Fran, I'm sorry. I can't lift my arm.\"\n\n\n I couldn't get any strength out of my body, so Fran had to hold me up and put the bottle to my mouth. I held my breath as a strong smell of herbs hit me.\n\n\n \"Fran, is this really drinkable?\"\n\n\n \"The Head Priest drank it just now. It is said to relieve fatigue and restore magic.\"\n\n\n Since it could relieve fatigue, I must drink it. The Head Priest himself drank it, so it was certainly not poison. After some internal struggle, I swallowed the medicine in one gulp, suppressing the bad smell.\n\n\n I almost threw up the moment the medicine entered my stomach.\n\n\n I covered my mouth in a hurry. My tongue was numb and my throat was burning. A strong bitterness ran through my mouth, and I suspected that whatever I ate now would have no taste.\n\n\n This is not something to drink at all!\n\n\n Seeing me in such pain, Fran ran to the Head Priest with a livid face.\n\n\n \"Head Priest, Master Maine seems to be in great pain…\"\n\n\n \"There's nothing strange about it. I sacrificed the taste of the medicine to make it work quickly.\"\n\n\n Said the Head Priest, without looking at me. But he was right. After I took the medicine, I didn't feel tired any more. Even the fever went away instantly.\n\n\n \"Oh, I think my fever's gone…\"\n\n\n The effect of this medicine was amazing. But while \"good medicine tastes bitter,\" this was too much. I sincerely hoped that the Head Priest would improve its taste. He had just said categorically that taste was sacrificed for effect, so it was unlikely that he would put much thought into it, but couldn't it be at least like vegetable juice?\n\n\n … Vegetable juice is bad enough, if you ask me.\n\n\n While I was resting, the knights also completely destroyed Tronbay. Unlike the previous giant Tronbay, this one did not create a hole. One of the knights said it was because the Tronbay here had been sprouted by absorbing my magic. In general, naturally growing Tronbay takes months or even years to soak up the magic of the surrounding land before it sprouts, so it takes a long time and effort to destroy it because its roots are deep and extensive.\n\n\n Having destroyed the Tronbay, the knights regrouped under the command of Castid. The only people who were not lined up were the two men who had just been ordered to guard me. They had taken off their helmets and were kneeling side by side before the Head Priest.\n\n\n \"Maine, come forward.\"\n\n\n I was named by the Head Priest with my recovery. I stood half a step behind him, as he had instructed me. I was still not tall, and the two kneeling knights only raised their heads slightly so I could see their faces. They were both young adults, just as I had judged them by their voices.\n\n\n Skicossa had striking yellow-green hair, and his dark green eyes were full of hatred for me. His features, though fine and regular, were pervaded by an undisguised pride.\n\n\n Damuel, by contrast, had unpretentious brown hair. He was looking at me with frightened, apologetic gray eyes. When he wore his helmet, I thought he was just a knight in shining armour, but when he took it off, I always felt that he had an aura about him that made people want to bully him.\n\n\n \"Skicossa, Damuel, have you anything to say in defence of this commotion?\"\n\n\n Upon hearing this from the Head Priest, Skicossa raised his head.\n\n\n \"I have nothing to defend. She is a commoner. That explains everything.\"\n\n\n Said Skicossa confidently, as if certain that the Head Priest knew what he meant. I felt my heart beating violently. If the victim is a commoner, then the perpetrator does not even have to justify himself -- again, I recognized this as a matter of course in this world.\n\n\n \"I must have ordered you not to let her get hurt.\"\n\n\n \"She suddenly stood up and hurt herself. I don't think I'm to blame for that.\"\n\n\n Hearing the angry questioning of the Head Priest, Skicossa remained firmly in denial.\n\n\n \"Is it?\" The Head Priest asked in a low voice and turned his eyes towards Damuel. Under the watchful eyes of the Head Priest, Damuel shuddered all over and said without daring to raise his head:\n\n\n \"Skicossa wanted me to remember who I was, so I couldn't disobey him. I'm awfully sorry.\"\n\n\n Looking at Damuel who was hurriedly defending himself, the Head Priest sighed.\n\n\n \"Yes, indeed you ought to remember who you are.\"\n\n\n Skicossa looked up in surprise at the words and looked at me triumphantly. Silently, I stroked the ceremonial dress disfigured by Tronbay.\n\n\n The Head Priest took a step forward.\n\n\n \"Then Let me ask you, Skicossa, who is the highest-ranking person here?\"\n\n\n \"Of course it's you, Lord Ferdinand.\"\n\n\n Skicossa answered without thinking. But he didn't seem to understand why the Head Priest asked such a question, and was now tilting his head in bewilderment.\n\n\n \"Yes, it is. And I have ordered you to protect the trainee priestess from any harm. If you know who you are, you will know who you are protecting and what your priorities are. It's you who don't remember who you are!\"\n\n\n Skicossa looked up at the Head Priest in astonishment.\n\n\n \"But she's a commoner, and a stupid kid who disturbs the temple…\"\n\n\n \"You don't seem to know anything about Maine, so I'll tell you. Maine is the trainee priestess who was given the blue robe. She possesses a magical power that no one else can match, so the temple made a request for her blue robe, and this request was granted by the Lord. If you are discontented with this, you are discontented with the temple and the Lord!\"\n\n\n Said the Head Priest sharply, and there was a gasp not only from Skicossa and Damuel, but also from some of the knights in the rear.\n\n\n \"You are well aware that the number of aristocrats in this kingdom is not what it used to be. This means that there are far fewer people who can manipulate the magic. Skicossa, you returned from the temple to the aristocracy, shouldn't you know this better than anyone else?\"\n\n\n I was just wondering about the relationship between Skicossa and the Temple Chief, and now it was all clear. It turned out that Skicossa had been a blue-robed trainee priest, who had been brought up in the temple. I finally understood why he was so disgusted by the fact that I was wearing a blue robe as a commoner. The blue-robed priests and priestesses in the temple shared his indignation at being equated with a commoner.\n\n\n \"In fact, Maine and I are the only people in the temple who can perform this ceremony. The temple would never send a trainee priestess here if there was a blue-robed priest who could do it. Haven't you thought this through? You are too stupid for me to judge. Maine, who has come with you here, is officially a blue-robed trainee priestess who is able to perform the ceremony, so what you have harmed is not a mere commoner as you think, but a trainee priestess who has been given the blue robe.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest emphasized several times my status as a blue-robed trainee priestess, just to show that if I were only a commoner, I would not be able to question Skicossa. Holding on to the blue dress that would have saved me from danger, I thanked Benno again for his wisdom. Without his advice, I would not be in the position I am now in.\n\n\n \"Not only have you disobeyed orders and harmed the blue-robed trainee priestess whom you were supposed to protect, but you have also placed an additional burden on the Order. Your conduct is a serious breach of the Order's rules and a stain on its reputation. The crimes you have committed are all felonies, and I am sure the Lord will give you a 'just' punishment.\"\n\n\n Then the Head Priest averted his eyes from Skicossa and Damuel, and turned to the Order in the rear, looking coldly at Castid, who was kneeling in the front.\n\n\n \"Castid, your complete ignorance of the character of your men has caused grave consequences. It also reflects your inadequate education of new men, for which you are to blame.\"\n\n\n \"As head of the Order, I take full responsibility. I'm sorry for the trouble this incident has caused you.\"\n\n\n According to what Castid had said, he must have been prepared for his punishment. His face was unruffled, and he quietly bowed his head to the Head Priest."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n \"Maine, finish the ceremony while the medicine is still working.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest calmed the anger a little and turned the gem into the winged lion again. In response to the action of him, the knights rose to their feet and summoned their animal mounts.\n\n\n \"Come on.\"\n\n\n I made a graceful move and took the Head Priest's hand which was stretched out to me. This time I had experience, and as soon as he lifted me onto the lion, I grabbed the reins to keep my balance. Then the Head Priest jumped upon the lion himself, and raised his hand.\n\n\n \"Let's go!\"\n\n\n The Head Priest clenched the reins and the lion was given life. Waving its huge wings, it took to the sky and headed for the hole created by the giant Tronbay.\n\n\n The Tronbay that had entangled me was the result of my blood, not the magic of the surrounding land, so there was no need for a special ceremony. But the magic had dried up where the gaint Tronbay used to be, and it was said that without the ceremony, nothing would ever grow.\n\n\n \"… I'm so sorry for what happened to you.\"\n\n\n We didn't have to worry about being overheard in the air, so the Head Priest behind me whispered to me.\n\n\n \"I had no intention of injuring you, nor of exposing you to such unguarded malice. I really didn't expect such a thing to happen, even to the point of forcing you to regain your strength by medicine for the ceremony. It was a mistake on my part not to take into account the fact that the Order would disobey my orders.\"\n\n\n There was regret and chagrin in the voice of the Head Priest. The guards were assigned to protect me in order to make sure everything went well, but the guards messed up, and the Head Priest seemed to feel very guilty about it. But neither the disobedient guardians, nor the malicious rumours, nor my natural infirmity, were his responsibilities.\n\n\n \"It's not your responsibility.\"\n\n\n \"No, whatever concerns you is my responsibility.\"\n\n\n Said the Head Priest firmly. He added that since the temple was in such a critical situation that I, as a commoner, had to be used to continue its operation, it was his duty as a superior to use my abilities properly. The Head Priest was very talented, so he must be one of those people who take care of everything himself.\n\n\n Did he ever feel tired?\n\n\n \"Maine, does the medicine work?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, it works.\"\n\n\n \"That's good. I know the ceremony is too much for your body, but now you must let the Order know that you are a blue-robed trainee priestess who is capable of doing a good job. I will protect you. You must show them that you are worthy to wear the blue robe and that you are indispensable to the temple and the Order. If the Order decides that your power is needed, it can be your guard hereafter. Let them see.\"\n\n\n On account of class, the Head Priest must protect me on the ground that I was not a commoner but a blue-robed trainee priestess, and I must give a result that corresponded to my status.\n\n\n \"But… I'm so nervous. Because it's my first time, I'm worried about whether I can make it.\"\n\n\n I knew I had to do it, but I was terribly worried about whether I could really make it. The Head Priest only gave a little laugh when he heard me mutter.\n\n\n \"Don't worry. I'll prepare a foil to compel the Order to acknowledge you.\"\n\n\n \"… Huh?\"\n\n\n \"My rule is never to fight a war without a chance to win.\"\n\n\n I shuddered at the icy tone of the Head Priest. It seemed that he was still angry that his plan had been ruined.\n\n\n \"… Well, Head Priest, Damuel is a good man. He tried to save me, and he did speak to Skicossa, so please be kind to him.\"\n\n\n Where the giant Tronbay grew, there was a circular hole with bare soil that looked as if someone had placed a huge reddish-brown plate in the forest.\n\n\n \"It would be a good place to build a village if the plants grew after the ceremony.\"\n\n\n \"If a village is built here, the priests and aristocrats who come to take part in blessing ceremonies and the Harvest Festival will suffer.\"\n\n\n \"Without regular blessing ceremonies, the magic of the land will be lost over time.\" The Head Priest added in a low voice. Indeed, if a village were to be built in the depths of such a dense forest, the peasants who would have to move in, and the priests and aristocrats who would have to travel long distances for the ceremonies, would probably complain a lot.\n\n\n The lion landed in the very centre of the hole, and the Head Priest helped me to the ground. The knights also landed all around us, and one by one the animal mounts returned to the knights' armour gloves.\n\n\n The knights took off their helmets and knelt when they were all in formation. It was said that wearing a helmet to the ceremony was disrespectful to gods. The Head Priest also took off his helmet and laid it at his feet. The soil beneath my feet was not the moist black soil I'd seen in the forest, but the reddish-brown dry soil I'd seen in the school playground.\n\n\n \"Head Priest.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest took the staff Arnaud had handed him, which was even taller than the average adult male.\n\n\n The staff was used in the ceremony and was a symbol of the goddess of water, Freudorene. A green magic stone, almost as big as a man's fist, glowed in the sun on the top of it, while rows of small magic stones were embedded in the handle below. Now, almost all magic stones had changed their colour, indicating that the staff was full of magic.\n\n\n \"Skicossa.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest shouted to the knights. Hearing that he was being called upon, Skicossa came quickly toward us, his armour rattling. The Head Priest handed him the staff.\n\n\n \"You perform the ceremony.\"\n\n\n Skicossa looked blankly at the Head Priest, but the Head Priest only looked down at him with cold eyes and sighed deliberately.\n\n\n \"You must have so much magic power left that you dared to ignore my command. I was going to show the trainee priestess myself, but because of you, I have done so much extra work that my magic is very little left.\"\n\n\n … What a lie! There is more than enough power in him!\n\n\n The Head Priest's medicine was so bitter that my tongue was numb, but as he himself said, the effect gained at the expense of taste was so great that it was impossible for him who had just taken it to be devoid of magic.\n\n\n \"You can do it, can't you? Come on, show Maine the difference between commoner and aristocrat.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest forced the staff into Skicossa's hand. Skicossa seemed overwhelmed by the unexpected, but as soon as he caught my eye, he stared sharply at me and straightened up.\n\n\n \"Freudorene, the goddess of water with the power of healing and change, and thy twelve attendants.\"\n\n\n Skicossa began his prayers in a clear, resonant voice. At the same time, the big magic stone inlaid on the top of the staff glowed, and the dry soil, centered on the staff, slowly turned out into rich black soil, and the green shoots came out one after another.\n\n\n I couldn't help marveling at how Skicossa could change the colour of the soil just by holding the staff and saying the prayers. It was like the special effects I'd seen in educational shows when I was still Urano.\n\n\n But before I had finished marveling, the soil stopped changing.\n\n\n \"No, that's not enough.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest reprimanded Skicossa and forced him to keep the staff. As long as it was held, the staff absorbed the magic of the person who held it. As the magic continued to be absorbed by the staff, Skicossa seemed to begin to lose consciousness and fell to his knees in weakness.\n\n\n \"Well, that's all you've got? What about that cocky look you've just had? The Order is seriously short of talent, I suppose.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest did not even give a glance to the limping Skicossa but reached out his hand to the wobbly staff and let me come forward.\n\n\n \"It's your turn, Maine.\"\n\n\n With all my energy, I spread my feet shoulder width apart and tightened my grip on the tall staff that could easily fall over. Thanks to Skicossa's demonstration, I was able to perform the ceremony with confidence.\n\n\n … Since the Head Priest wants me to show others what I can do, I'd better pour a lot of magic into the staff, wouldn't I?\n\n\n I exerted force on the hands that held the staff, breathed deeply and slowly, and then opened the lid, which was usually tightly closed to keep the magic from escaping, allowing the magic inside me to begin to flow. The magic gushed out of the depths of my body and sought an outlet to the staff.\n\n\n \"Freudorene, the goddess of water with the power of healing and change, and thy twelve attendants. Hear my prayer, and grant me the holy power to heal thy sister Gaederich, the goddess of earth, who has been perished by demons.\"\n\n\n The big green magic stone on the staff suddenly gave out a strong light. The magic swirled around me. My hair was blowing up and the sleeves and hem of my ceremonial dress were flipping.\n\n\n \"Sacred music is offered to thee. Spread supreme waves, and give us the clear guard of thee. May thy colour fill the land I desire.\"\n\n\n The magic surged into the staff, spreading through the magic stone into the dry soil. The area of the black soil expanded instantly, and in the blink of an eye the vegetation sprouted in succession.\n\n\n \"… stop, that's enough.\"\n\n\n At this I suppressed the still gush of magic and closed the lid. At the same time, the magic stone's light dimmed. I looked up and saw that the dry land was covered in ankle-high grass.\n\n\n \"Head Priest, is this the completion of the ceremony?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, the whole land is full of magic… it's a bit too much, actually.\"\n\n\n The last few words were very low and vague, so I didn't catch them. I looked curiously at the Head Priest, but he just shook his head slightly and turned to face the knights. I followed him to the knights, and found them all dumbfounded, as if they had seen something they couldn't believe.\n\n\n … Huh? Why is everyone wearing that face? I worked so hard with the magic because the Head Priest wanted me to show it to others. Did I… go too far?"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Seeing all the people looking at me in amazement, I didn't know what to do, but slowly approached the Head Priest. The Head Priest stood in front of me and cleared his throat.\n\n\n \"This is the blue-robed trainee priestess who has been approved by the temple and the Lord. Does anyone have any objections?\"\n\n\n The knights were all silent. That was probably a sign of no objection. I looked up at the Head Priest and he gave me a slight nod.\n\n\n \"… it seems your answer is no. Very good.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest chuckled, and the knights finally came to their senses. But their expressions had changed. Their eyes were no longer wide with surprise, but all glowed as if they had found a game.\n\n\n \"Huh?!\"\n\n\n I forced myself not to scream. Under their eyes, I was petrified and stiff. I felt like a frog targeted by a snake, ready to be eaten if I wasn't careful. To escape the sight of the knights, I moved my trembling feet and hid myself in the shadow cast by the Head Priest.\n\n\n \"And I forgot to tell you that the trainee priestess is under my protection. You all understand what that means, don't you?\"\n\n\n With these words the carnivorous looks of the knights vanished. I felt relieved, but what did the Head Priest really mean? Looked like I was the only one who didn't know.\n\n\n \"Very well. Let's go back to town.\"\n\n\n While I was still confused, everyone else was already preparing to head back to town. Arnaud took the staff from the Head Priest, and Fran came to confirm my condition. The knights put on their helmets again, summoned their animal mounts, and got ready to take off.\n\n\n \"Come here, Maine.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest and Castad called to me from the spot where Skicossa had collapsed. Resisting the urge to run, I walked slowly toward them.\n\n\n \"Maine, do you have any claims for what happened today?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest fixed his eyes on Skicossa, and it seemed that he was only going through the motions of asking my opinion as a victim. His expression clearly wanted me to say \"no\", but I decided to ignore it.\n\n\n \"Yes.\"\n\n\n As soon as I replied, the Head Priest frowned. Even though I knew he was screaming \"Mind the occasion! \" to me inside, but I decided to keep ignoring it.\n\n\n \"I would like to ask you to prepare a new ceremonial dress for me.\"\n\n\n They both seemed surprised at my request and stared down at me. I spread my arms so that they could see my clothes better -- there were two big holes in the sleeves and they could even see the trees through them.\n\n\n \"Please make me a new dress like this one, for it is newly made and very expensive. A commoner like me cannot afford to order another ceremonial dress.\"\n\n\n \"I see. We really should compensate for that.\"\n\n\n Castad could not help laughing, and immediately agreed with me. \"What do you mean when you say you want one like this one?\" asked the Head Priest, perhaps not quite understanding me.\n\n\n \"The dress was made especially for me. I asked my tailor to use special techniques so that I could still wear it when I grew taller. It was torn before I could grow even 1cm taller, which was just too much to accept.\"\n\n\n I heaved a huge, exaggerated sigh, which provoked Castad to laugh.\n\n\n \"It seems that women's obsession with clothes has nothing to do with age. You may rest assured that a new ceremonial dress will be prepared for you.\"\n\n\n Castad gave his full consent. It was hardly a punishment, but I was satisfied.\n\n\n \"Thank you, Lord Castad. A visit to the Gilberta Company will help you settle the matter. I cannot attend the ceremony without ceremonial dress, so please make sure this is done before winter.\"\n\n\n \"Before winter? Why?\" Asked Castad, puzzled.\n\n\n \"There will be ceremonies in the winter… and if she is not wearing a ceremonial dress, the temple chief and the other blue-robed priests and priestesses will laugh at her for not being able to afford a ceremonial dress, even if she has done nothing wrong.\"\n\n\n When the Head Priest finished, I nodded gravely. This was what I found most troubling and what I feared most. Even if another Tronbay appears, it doesn't matter if I'm wearing a ceremonial dress full of holes, as the knights know what happened today. However, for the winter ceremonies, I still wanted to wear a new and beautiful dress.\n\n\n \"I see. I will let the new ceremonial dress finish on time. Do you have any other requests?\"\n\n\n \"I shall be quite content if you can get me a new ceremonial dress. In other matters the order of the Order shall be obeyed, and I do not wish to provoke further undue resentment.\"\n\n\n \"Well, that's wise. Then, the other matters will be decided by the Order.\"\n\n\n Castad nodded, and I bowed my head to thank him.\n\n\n \"This is too much! Why are there big holes in Master Maine's dress? It's only just been made!\"\n\n\n \"Fran, what has happened to Master Maine?!\"\n\n\n When I returned to the temple, Delia screamed at my torn ceremonial dress, and Rosina covered her mouth and stumbled a little.\n\n\n \"Much has happened, but as it concerns the Order, the Head Priest has decreed that it cannot be talked about.\"\n\n\n Fran replied, dodging their inquiries.\n\n\n I changed my clothes before Lutz saw me, but he knew I was in danger. When he came to pick me up, he looked flustered. He grabbed my hand and said, \"Maine, the best thing is that you're safe!\" He immediately began to examine my physical condition, as if he knew what had happened to me.\n\n\n \"Lutz, how do you know?\"\n\n\n \"All of a sudden in my head I heard you yelling, 'Lutz, help!' and then I saw you… It almost killed me that I wanted to save you, but I didn't know where you were.\"\n\n\n Lutz's mental image had stopped just before I was rescued, so he didn't know what had happened to me, and he was in a state of panic until I returned.\n\n\n \"I'm sorry to have worried you, Lutz.\"\n\n\n I suspected that the blue light must have been responsible for Lutz's magical experience. The ring had been returned to the Head Priest. I looked at my bare fingers, and all the memories of today flashed through my mind.\n\n\n \"I'm really glad you're okay.\"\n\n\n Lutz threw his arms around me, and his voice came straight to my ears. My nerves relaxed in the face of a boy who cared nothing about status or magic, but genuinely worried about my safety. I knew he would never throw me off at any time, so I was able to coquettish to him without being shy.\n\n\n \"… aristocratic society is terrible.\"\n\n\n I whispered, holding Lutz tight.\n\n\n Not surprisingly, I fell into a trance after the disturbance. I slept for a few days, but this was a common occurrence at this time of year, so my family didn't say anything. I just wish the Head Priest would stop thinking that everything was his fault and take on so many unnecessary responsibilities.\n\n\n By the time I was well enough to move about, the end of autumn was drawing near, and it was too cold to make paper out of the river water.\n\n\n \"I've got to go to the Gilberta Company before I go home.\"\n\n\n As I pondered this, I reached the temple gate, where Fran was waiting for me.\n\n\n \"The Head Priest has called for you, Master Maine. He seems to have something important to say to you. He wants you to come to his office as soon as you arrive at the temple.\"\n\n\n I went to the Dean's Office and changed into the blue robe before I set off for the Head Priest's Office. It seemed that I couldn't touch Fespiel, but I wanted to practice it especially today. I walked slowly, but no matter how much I procrastinated, I finally arrived at my destination.\n\n\n \"Maine, here you are. I think Fran has told you. Come in.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest's face was a little grave, and he strode off to the secret room. It seemed certain that I would not escape his sermon. I had no choice but to enter the secret room opened by him.\n\n\n \"Bring me all the papers over there.\"\n\n\n I pushed aside the papers on the bench, and was about to sit down as before, when the Head Priest, as he spoke thus, held out his hand to me. I organized the papers into a sheaf and handed them to him. He laid the papers on the table and pulled up his chair as usual. But today he carried a fine gold headband set with a red gem, and a bottle small enough to hide in the palm of his hand.\n\n\n \"Drink this, Maine.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest opened his hand and handed me that little bottle. I saw that it contained some red liquid.\n\n\n \"What's this?\"\n\n\n \"It's a potion I concocted to make it easier for the magic to penetrate the body. You have to drink it in order to use this magic tool. No matter how bitter or foul it smells, you have to drink it.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest, with a power which I could not question, held the bottle before me. Hearing what he said, I felt even less inclined to drink it. I still remembered the murderous smell of his medicine. Seeing my hesitation, he narrowed his pale golden eyes and smiled.\n\n\n \"Do you prefer to be held by the nose and force-fed?\"\n\n\n He was serious. He was the kind of person who would do terrible things whenever he saw the need.\n\n\n I hurriedly shook my head and took the bottle in his hand. What will it taste like this time? I nervously raised the bottle to my mouth. This time, however, there was no strange smell. I drank all the potion in one gulp with a heroic attitude.\n\n\n \"… eh?\"\n\n\n This potion was not bitter at all, and even tasted good.\n\n\n \"Head Priest, not only is this not bitter at all, but it has a sweet taste. If only the healing medicine were as good as this.\"\n\n\n I handed the empty bottle to the Head Priest, and his eyes widened in surprise.\n\n\n \"Does it taste sweet to you?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. What's wrong with that?\"\n\n\n \"… nothing. Well, put this on. The gem should be on your forehead.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest held out the gold headband. There was probably no use resisting, so I took it and put it on. Like the ring, the headband was immediately shrunk to my size and fitted over my head.\n\n\n \"Head Priest, what is it? Is this also a magic tool?\"\n\n\n \"It is what I asked the Lord to lend me, and now it has finally arrived.\"\n\n\n \"What is it for… eh? What's the matter?\"\n\n\n After putting on the headband, I suddenly felt very sleepy. My mind went blank and I couldn't lift my eyes.\n\n\n \"Why? Why am I so sleepy…?”\n\n\n \"Close your eyes and sleep. There is no need to resist.\"\n\n\n The voice of the Head Priest sounded faint. I could hear him, but it seemed to take me a while to catch his meaning. Now that he had said I had no need to resist, I resigned to the intense drowsiness and prepared for bed as usual. I took off my hairpin, my shoes, and lay down on the bench. As soon as I lay down, my consciousness fell into the abyss of darkness.\n\n\n \"Good night…\"\n\n\n As I made a last effort to say good night to the Head Priest, I felt his fingertips brush my bangs. He seemed very close to me, and his voice entered my head without any hindrance.\n\n\n \"This is a memory-exploring magic tool that is used in critical situations to determine whether a suspect or witness has lied… So, let me see your so-called dream world.\""

    "content": " \n\n\n\n <Lord Karstedt, your guest, Lord Ferdinand has arrived>\n\n\n After receiving the announcement from one of his assistants, Karstedt made his way to the main hall. There he found his first wife, Elvira, and his oldest son, Eckhard, talking friendly with Ferdinand. Karstedt couldn't help but smile at the respect his family still had for that man; there were just a few noblemen who still respected Ferdinand after he was sent to the temple, and it was nice to see his family between them.\n\n\n <Lord Ferdinad>, Karstedt gave his welcome, Ferdinand turned to him. after exchanging greeting and getting a seat, their assistants began to place the table. <I hate to interrupt your conversation but Ferdinand and I need to discuss things in private>.\n\n\n Karstedt received displeased looks from Elvira and Eckhard, but when Ferdinand waved his hand and said <This is highly confidential>, both of them left at the same time. The way they both treated Ferdinand with more respect than him would have frustrated Karstedt if he weren't s used to it. *1\n\n\n As soon as the wine and the food arrived it was placed on the table, and all assistants left, leaving Ferdinand and Karstedt alone in the room. Only when the door was tightly closed Karstedt relaxed, Changing to the informal tone he always used with his old friend.\n\n\n \"Sorry for making you come to my place instead of the palace, Ferdinand. Things are not so pretty over there\"\n\n\n Karstedt picked his glass and took a sip of his wine to show it wasn't poisoned and made a small gesture to Ferdinand, after which he took the glass with his hand and also took a sip. his mouth crawled his approbation, showing the wine was of his liking.\n\n\n \"I imagine it wouldn't be. The mother of Shikikoza is making a ruckus and is pestering everyone to be heard, no? and the High bishop has been making a tantrum about it\". Ferdinand was correct, leaving Karstedt only able to nod with an ironic smile.\n\n\n Ten days ago, during a standard Trombe extermination mission, Karstedt - the captain of the knight order - had assigned Shikikoza and Darmuel to watch over the blue shrine maiden. They possessed way less mana than the other knights present, and none of them had experience against Trombe, for that reason Karstedt thought it was the best to get away from the fight, protecting the people of the temple.\n\n\n However, they had harmed the one they were supposed to protect which led to the growth of a second Trombe in what can only be described as a catastrophic disaster. For that reason, they were under house arrest in the knight's headquarters until their punishment was decided.\n\n\n Shikikoza, however, managed to get in contact with his family with the hopes of a lighter punishment, and her mother was asking for help from any person with power that heard her.\n\n\n \"It seems like she even cried in presence of Lady Veronica, the reason for which I imagined it would be better if I returned that tool in your stead\", said Karstedt while pointing to the box that contained the magic tool that Ferdinand had with him.\n\n\n \"Indeed, thanks, I'd prefer to avoid seeing her if I can help it\"\n\n\n The box, which was only able to be open by the archduke or a person with his authorization, contained the magic tool capable of reading another person's memories. It was lent to Ferdinand to see if the commoner made into a blue shrine maiden that has shown an enormous amount of mana in the recovery ritual was a potential threat to Ehrenfest or a blessing.\n\n\n The apprentice blue shrine maiden had dark blue hair as the night sky as if she had received the blessing of the God of Darkness from birth, and her beautiful face was highlighted by two golden eyes like the moon. But the most peculiar thing was her small body, so thin and underdeveloped that it was hard to believe she had already been baptized.\n\n\n But in contrast to her childish appearance, she had exploded with so much mana that dazzled the mind. She hasn't shown any signs of exhaustion after refilling the drained land, and by a glance, you could see she had way much more times the mana that Shikikoza, a laynoble who was only allowed to leave the temple because the country was experiencing a lack of mana.\n\n\n That wasn't the normal quantity of mana that a normal blue shrine maiden has. How much would she has when she grows up and got to the majority of age ceremony\n\n\n Karstedt himself had never made the ritual, nor touched a divine instrument, which made it difficult to judge the amount of mana the blue shrine maiden had. But it was abnormal enough that Ferdinand had immediately requested the archduke to determine if she was a threat or not, and the archduke gave the permission to use the mindreading tool.\n\n\n \"…So, how did it go?\" Karstedt ask while taking the box\n\n\n In a rare display of transparency, Ferdinand didn't make any effort to hide his face while rubbing his forehead.\n\n\n \"she doesn't have any trace of malice or deceit on her. Her mind was fill of nothing but books, in a tiering way\"\n\n\n He said with a completely upset expression, but Karstedt could feel that something was different in him. Ferdinand looked expressive and excited, maybe for the first time since the death of his father, when he said <I'm tired of handling the pressure of those around me. I don't care what happens to the world>, before renouncing everything and going to the temple with a dead expression.\n\n\n \"Truly\", Ferdinand continued, \"Myne is a girl that has memories of living as a high noble in another world\". Despite her age here, she has memories of her past life as an adult\"\n\n\n \"Huh? here we go again?\"\n\n\n The report from Ferdinand about Myne was so out of rule that Karstedt doubts his ears. Without even thinking about it. he asked Ferdinand to repeat it, and he did. Karstedt didn't hope that there was any mistake since the magic tool was made to get rid of all doubts, but the report from Ferdinand was still difficult to believe.\n\n\n \"I, eh… don't know what to say. It's absurd\". Karstedt managed to make a response and Ferdinand nodded with his head.\n\n\n \"Even I believe it's absurd and I saw that world in her memories. I doubt many believe it, but is true. Myne's extraordinay behavior is due to living in the lower city in addition to keeping her memories of living on the other world. However, she has no malice nor bad intentions towards the city. But she only cares about books, it'll be necessary that the ones beside her, are able to guide her to make her usefull\"\n\n\n What interested Karstedt the most wasn't the ridiculous story about Myne living in another world, which he still could not believe, but how talkative was Ferdinand beeing. In spite of having to link his mind with another to see by force his memories. surprisingly he didn't look disgusted.\n\n\n \"Did you take a liking to her\"\n\n\n \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\n \"Who else the blue shrine maiden apprentice called Myne?\"\n\n\n Karstedt knew very well the importance of a blue shrine maiden apprentice these days, where there was a drastic lack of mana and nobles, but Ferdinand was showing more interest than he would have thought to this low profile girl Myne. Ferdinand had allowed her to ride his own beast, he allowed her to bring not one but two assistants, and shown extreme overprotection by assigning two guards before the hunt, he had even given her a ring and a potion of his own creation.\n\n\n And, above else, he had declared she was under her protection in front of all knights. Karstedt could remember how surprised he was when that happened, he'd never expected to hear Ferdinand said anything like that.\n\n\n Karstedt observations led Ferdinand to make a girn with dissatisfaction.\n\n\n \"I haven't take a liking to her or anything like that. She is that valuable\"\n\n\n \"Oh?\"\n\n\n When Ferdinand started to say how useful her abundance of mana was and her exceptional mathematical abilities were in the temple. on top of her constant discoveries and inventions, Karstedtfelt the urge to ask how was that different from liking her. But he deliberately kept that in silence. Ferdinand had the tendency to hide things that were important to him or distance himself apart from them, and that tendency had only intensified when he joined the temple.\n\n\n …Ferdinand, in spite of all his stubborn and obstinate tendencies, finally had found someone he liked. There was no reason to make fun of him and risk it to mess it up - that was the conclusion Karstedt arrived to. having known Ferdinand since he was young, and thus knowing how susceptible he was to self-sabotage, Karstedt knew there were a lot of things he had to be cautious about.\n\n\n \"She has shown a great quantity of mana to everyone\", Started Karstedt. \"the rumors have extended like powder through the Noble district, with the knight order in the center of it, Myne will be in more danger than before\"\n\n\n \"undoubtedly. Her mana was more extraordinary than what I had predicted. although I said she is under my protection, ultimately, I'm nothing but a simple priest. The noblemen that look for mana will pursue her, and one day they will put her in harm's way. It's impossible for me to say if I'll be able to avoid all their advances\" Ferdinand quietly spoke, his face inexpressive as ever. There weren't many people that really know that he was making an expression of someone immensely frustrated with their lack of power.\n\n\n \"What will you do then?\n\n\n \"I'd like you to adopt Myne\" Ferdinand asked, which made Karstead open his eyes with surprise. As captain of the knight order, Karstedt was an Archnoble. By suggesting him adopting Myne, Ferdinand insinuated that she had at least as much mana as an Archnoble.\n\n\n \"The sooner she is adopted by a noble the better\" Ferdinand continued. \"she has too much mana to be kept as a simple Blue shrine maiden. This means shell have to learn to control her mana in the Real Academy, but as a man of the church, I will not be able to support her with noble matters. I trust in few to defend her from the dangers that await her.\n\n\n Karstedt considered the preposition. Who could Ferdinand trust so much as to leave Myne in their care despite her lower uprising and that would provide the proper education for someone with her amount of mana? he couldn't on anyone but him and his family.\n\n\n \"I have the intention of educating Myne so that she doesn't become a shame for your family. And Myne has enough talent to sustain herself economically, and I'll make sure that you don't have to strain yourself by adopting her\".\n\n\n \"Is truly rare that you are so worried about someone else\" reflected Karstedt\n\n\n Ferdinand lowered his sight. he sank into his chair and kept silent, his long fingers intertwine while looking for something to say. He then started.\n\n\n \"Since she is a commoner, it's impossible to tell what's going to happen without a powerful ally who supports her. I wouldn't like anyone to though what I lived. That's all\".\n\n\n That wasn't everything. but at least Ferdinand was telling the truth talking from the hearth without trying to deceive anyone. Karstedt, knowing well the painful past of Ferdinand, let out a sigh and looked to the window.\n\n\n \"…I'm willing to adopt her, but someone will complain to you about asking my help first, no?\"\n\n\n Ferdinand could guess who Karstedt was referring to. His expression darkened and he tapped his forehead \"it should be really difficult to manage everyone…?\"\n\n\n There weren't many who could tell that his dark expression meant he was really relaxed. Karstedt once more made an ironic grin at how difficult was Ferdinand to understand."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The head priest used a magic tool to look into my memories of my previous life. That really surprised me, but I understood his reasoning really well. There wasn't a better way to prove that I was innocent and not a threat. And that magic tool was shown to be more than incredible. Using that tool, I could reed any book I previously read by simply visiting that world in my mind.\n\n\n I asked the head priest to use the tool again, but he strongly refused.\n\n\n …I know he only saw my memories to see how valuable I was and if I was a threat, but still, what would be the danger in doing me a favor let me play sometimes. Head priest you stingy.\n\n\n I was complaining a bit, but honestly, I was thankful that the head priest decided I was no longer a threat and allow me to continue inventing new products under Benno's supervision. Thanks to that I was able to keep living as if nothing happened.\n\n\n …without mentioning that I learned a lot from all of this.\n\n\n I learn how much my mother was looking out for me, and how much my current family is taking care of me. I want to repay my family in this life, to compensate for what I did in the past. I want to cherish my time with them, instead of thinking about it as mundane and ordinary.\n\n\n \"Myne, we started printing the illustration books yesterday, together while making paper\".\n\n\n It was the day after my experience with the dream world and Lutz was telling me about how the Myne Workshop was doing while on our way to the Gilberta Company, for what it seems the first time in a long while.\n\n\n \"So, Lutz, how many illustrated books do you think we can do? how much paper do you have?\"\n\n\n \"I think that eighty books is the best we can do and that is if we also use the paper we are doing now. We can make seventy-five with what we have now… seventy-six in the best case, but I know you said you want to do as many as possible at the same time\"\n\n\n \"Uh, Huh, thanks. It's going to be harder now that it's cold, but I'm counting on you\"\n\n\n According to Lutz, the second printing of the children's bible would end up having around eighty copies. It wouldn't take long to finish since the gray priests had already learned how the printing worked the last time we did it together. with that done, we just need a way to sell the illustrated books.\n\n\n I looked at my feet and mutter \"maybe we should make a new guild for this\"\n\n\n \"a new guild?\"\n\n\n \"Uhn, Like a printing guild or an editorial guild… the books we are doing in the Myne Workshop are different from the books that the nobles have, right?\"\n\n\n The books that existed before ours were packs of parchment, each made individually by hand. They attached colorful and detailed illustrations to the pages and the studded leather covers were decorated with gold and gems, making the books into pieces of art with an extravagant cost attached to them.\n\n\n \"The books we are making can hardly be called art, yes\" and Lutz pointed out \"Well we do children's books after all…\"\n\n\n \"And the production method is completely different. I only know this because the Head chief told me but, other books aren't made by a single workshop\"\n\n\n Until now, each step in the process of creating a book had required the contribution of numerous craftsmen and different workshops- someone to write the text, someone to draw the art, someone to gather the paper and strap it together, someone for the leather cover, someone to decorate it with gold and gems, and so on and so on. Due to this, there wasn't a workshop dedicated to books in this world.\n\n\n However, the books made by the Myne Workshop utilized Myne's printing technology which meant that one single workshop was able to do many copies of the same book at a time. That would introduce a completely new line of work. the Stokebrokers profession was born overnight, and it was necessary a guild to guaranty the rights to the technology and the profits, and to organize workshops to handle a certain standard.\n\n\n \"First I need to talk with Benno but… Well\"\n\n\n If I started to sell books, they will have to pass through Lutz to be sold to the Gilberta Company. In which case, Benno would be the one that has to add the printing guild to his list of jobs. After all, it was hard to imagine entrusting that kind of job to another person. Maybe that would be too much.\n\n\n \"the Gilberta Company is a clothing Shop right? Then you have the Rinsham workshop, the plant paper guild and his workshops, the Italian Restaurant that we hope to be open by spring…\" I counted all jobs I know Benno had surprised at how he was basically involved in all of them. \"There is a lot to do and we add the printing guild on top of that, I'm afraid Benno might get so busy that he may collapse\"\n\n\n If Benno Died from overwork, would I be the culprit? Luts shacked his head while I was turning pale with concern.\n\n\n \"Master Benno is busy because he wants to be. It's not something that should worry you. We only have to worry when Mark starts to intervene\"\n\n\n Having in mind that Benno took the extra work by choice, while Mark simply followed him to make sure everything was going fine, I decided that I should be more concerned about Mark dying first due to work overload.\n\n\n \"Myne! What the hell did you do this time?\n\n\n A thunderstorm from Benno fell the moment I entered his office. I hadn't even mentioned the printing guild yet- in fact, I had come to speak with him before I did something myself, so I had no idea why he was so angry. All I could do was shake my head, blinking confused, while shaking in fear.\n\n\n \"W-wha-what are you talking about?! I haven't done anything yet!\"\n\n\n \"I received an order from an Archnoble- they are telling me to make new ceremonial robes for you as soon as humanly possible. Of course you did something! Spit it out ten! What happened!?\n\n\n I immediately understood what Benno was referring to and I clapped my hands.\n\n\n \"Ooh, by an Archnoble do you mean Lord Karstedt, right? He is the captain of the knight order, you know. I'm happy he kept his promise\". I was a bit worried that he wouldn't… What a relief.\n\n\n \"Not for me! My heart almost stopped when an Archnoble summoned me out of nowhere!\" Yelled Benno. \"Tell me when this kind of thing happens!\"\n\n\n After imagining what he felt, the blood drained from my face. Being summoned by an Archnoble out of nowhere without knowing anything would be scary.\n\n\n \"I'm Sorry! I was in bed with fever and completely forgot\"\n\n\n Without mentioning that I shouldn't discuss things related to the order with no one, so I hadn't give Lutz all the details yet nor to my assistants. The idea of informing Benno didn't even cross my mind.\n\n\n \"Well, whatever. I almost had a heart attack, but now I have a connection with an Archnoble. I'm going to take advantage of this as much as possible. Anyways… didn't we just finish your ceremonial robes just the other day? What happened to those?\"\n\n\n \"They told me not to say anything because it involved the knight order, but in short they are completely destroyed\" thinking about the torn robes in my mind, I let my shoulders down and made a <X> with my arms in front of my chest.\n\n\n Benno Scratched his head\n\n\n \"That doesn't help, then. I can guess it's one of those things that is better not to know. That said, if you are not here for the robes, what do you have for me?\"\n\n\n \"We started the second round of printing for the children's bible and thought it would be better to talk with you about how to sell them. You made a plant paper guild for the paper we created, so I wonder if you would like to do a printing guild for books\"\n\n\n I explain why I thought a printing guild was necessary while looking at my diptych, and Benno just nodded while stroking his chin.\n\n\n \"A printing Guild, eh? That will be necessary sooner or later, and we don't want no one stealing the rights to your inventions, we could go ahead and create one now. Myne, how many books can you sell at this moment\"\n\n\n \"…I can use some of the ones we are about to make as textbooks, so we can sell the twenty I made before if necessary\"\n\n\n In the end, I hadn't had the need to sell any books when I was buying clothes. I had given five books as presents and the other five in the dining hall, but the other twenty were in the workshop.\n\n\n \"Lutz,\" Benno said, \"go get the ones in the workshop. We aren't getting permission for the printing guild without real examples\"\n\n\n Lutz ran to the temple, leaving me behind to answer any question that Benno had about opening the new printing guild. He looked so busy while scribbling on the wood tablets that I couldn't help but frown, worried that I was really giving him too much work.\n\n\n \"…Benno, isn't the printing guild and all the other work I piled on you too much to handle?\" I asked worried \"will you be alright?\"\n\n\n He looked at me and sigh\n\n\n \"Don't worry about it, We could be making a guild here but that's not gonna mean the creations of new printing workshops\"\n\n\n \"What? Why not? I need more workshops to appear so they can fill the world with books\"\n\n\n \"In the first place, the market is too small; Not many people buy books. Second, there aren't many plant paper workshops yet. No one even knows how to make printing ink. Things haven't developed enough yet to make more workshops possible. That's why making a new guild won't give me too much extra work.\n\n\n Benno was extremely busy when he created the plant paper guild since he had to fight back against the created interest and at the same time create workshops before anyone else could do it. But that wasn't the case with the printing guild, not much would happen since the necessary components for printing weren't widespread yet.\n\n\n \"I can't believe I've worked so hard to make printing happen and it isn't giving place to new books. I'm happy you are not busy Benno, but I'm displeased to hear that the printing guild won't be able to prosper\"\n\n\n \"The fact that the printing guild ends busy or not would depend on how much people like those books you are making\" mutter Benno while writing.\n\n\n I started to reflect on our client base and the alphabetization rate on the country\n\n\n \"I believe that the bibles for childer will be really appreciated by the noblemen with small kids… particularly the laynobles and the mednobles, since they aren't as rich in general. For that reason, I plan on to keep making illustrated books about the gods and knights, and such for a while\"\n\n\n \"I had thought about it while on the bed. Particularly about the magic weapons that the knight order had used in the fight against Trombe, the divine blessings, and the healing ritual. The bright staffs that everyone had most likely were catalysts to use magic, since changing its form with mana should be very easy, But when it comes to blessings rituals and other bigscale magic uses, it was essential to use the name of the gods. All the difficult prayers that I had to memorize included them, as did the one utilized by the knight order to enchant their weapons with the good of darkness blessings. I had even given an accidental blessing by mentioning the name of one god in my prayer.\n\n\n In other words, in the noble society is absolutely necessary to learn the name of the gods to use any type of significant magic.\n\n\n \"The nobles have to learn the name of the gods, whatever happens. And the owner of big stores with connections to the nobles also have to memorize the name of the gods, right? I remember that you said the name of a god when meeting the head priest, Benno. I believe we could sell our books to both nobles and rich merchants if we focus on how productive the learning would be\"\n\n\n \"…You have been learning about nobles little by little over there. If that is what you think, I'd say you are probably right. But it's still not looking good enough. You should really work on getting leather cover for them\" Benno said\n\n\n But I shook my head\n\n\n \"No. it's fine as it is. I believe it's going to be better if anyone that wants a leather cover to get one in a workshop that already makes leather covers for books\"\n\n\n \"Your reasoning?\" Benno's gaze got sharper, his red eyes shined in the dark\n\n\n I raised a finger, pointing directly to the roof.\n\n\n \"First, to spread the workload. If you order the leather covers through the Gilberta Company, you'll have to ask all of them to the same workshop. I don't believe that placing all that pressure in one workshop is going to be good for the quality or fast deliveries. The principle of economic competition is really important here\"\n\n\n \"Oh right, you hate exclusivity and all that\"\n\n\n Benno seems to have interpreted from our discussions about the Italian restaurants me hating dedicated workshops. However, I didn't hate the idea by itself.\n\n\n \"Actually, I believe it's ok to have a preferred workshop, but not when that prevents to order from another workshop, even when you know your favorite workshop won't be able to handle the amount of work, not to mention that I believe that letting a workshop monopolize the work will lead to conflict\" I frown my lips while Benno let out a sigh.\n\n\n \"Next?\"\n\n\n \"Second, let the client adapt their books to their own preference\" I continued explaining now with two fingers raised \"if they are going to spend so much money on a book, they will like it to be exactly as they want, Right? I think the clients will be happier if we let them choose the type of cover they want. That way they won't have to take out what we place to have their own cover. Books made in our workshop are sewed with thread so it's easy to pull them apart and personalize them\"\n\n\n While explaining, I thought about the second batch of books. My intention was to use the fur glue that we made to make the books, but if we are going to make the books with personalization in mind I think it's going to be better to keep using a string.\n\n\n \"Third is about the time. It'll take much more time to make books if each of them needs a fancy leather cover. The key strength o the Myne Workshop is that it can produce a large number of identical books in a short amount of time, which would be undermined by the time it takes to create leather covers. I'd prefer to use that time to make more books\"\n\n\n I was more worried about the number of books in the world than making sure that each book was a work of art beautifully crafted, that's why I hate the idea of a book taking so long to be made. That was just personal preference, but even then,. I won't budge on that.\n\n\n \"Fourth is the price. If the books aren't cheap, our small client base won't increase, and the most important thing for us is to sell the books in the first place. Not to mention that even poor noblemen that would only want them for the pride of having them, can shield themself by saying that their favorite workshop is busy, and I'm sure that there are some clients that are interested in the content of the books, not their appearance\"\n\n\n Benno frowned his brown when I finish listing all the reasons as to why I don't want leather covers.\n\n\n \"I understand that you want to sell the books as cheap as possible, to expand books as much as you can. It's a shame that that is the exact opposite of what a merchant would do. I want to raise the price as much as I can and get all the profit I'm able to\"\n\n\n Benno says that it is a common practice to focus on the aesthetic side to raise the value of a product. the price would increment until the clients are almost unable to pay it, to get the most amount of money possible.\n\n\n \"…My way won't work?\"\n\n\n \"If you only stay in the city, then probably not, but is not a really bad idea if you are talking about selling it in the whole country\" You only have to focus on how are they different from the current books. Benno briefly closed his eyes and then looked at me with the look of an opportunistic merchant\n\n\n \"I'm talking from my trader instinct her but… I have a feeling that when it comes to books I should just let you do as you please while it's possible. I only wanted to hear your reasoning, since this is new territory for everyone\" he said, giving me permission to sell my books bind as they were.\n\n\n \"Alright, then, let's drop the price as much as we can without leaving the point of balance\"\n\n\n \"No. we are still going to profit here. expand the books while earning money, you idiot\"\n\n\n …Grr, it's always about the profit With Benno.\n\n\n Lutz came back with a bag full of books, just when we finish the paperwork. I sold them to Benno and got three big gold coins. On one side I was a bit sad because there was still a lot of time before could sell at a lower price, but on the other side, I felt safer by having a decent amount of money again. With this, I will be able to buy a bit more food for me and the orphanage before the snow began to fall.\n\n\n \"Myne, we're heading to the merchant's guild\"\n\n\n Benno gave the books to Lutz and picked me up as he always did when we headed to the guild. The moment when stepped outside, we were met by a row of carts filled with crops. The farmers sold their products when the city started to prepare for the winter, and since a lot of people were buying crops the streets were livelier than ever. There was an awful smell from all the people making candles.\n\n\n \"actually, Benno - do you think that nobles would buy candles that don't stink?\"\n\n\n I've heard that nobles used candles made from bee wax, but maybe nobles were interested in a cheaper alternative maybe they would be like normal candles that didn't smell. I asked Benno what he thought about it while thinking about the candles we have made in the orphanage, and he raised his brown while looking at me with an unbelievable face.\n\n\n \"candles that don't smell you say?\"\n\n\n \"Oh, Myne, are you talking about the candles you salted and then mixed with herbs? I haven't used them yet, but the candles themselves smell less than the normal ones\"\n\n\n \"Lutz! you didn't tell me about this!\", Benno shouted, which made Lutz's green eyes open wide.\n\n\n \"What…? I told you about them when I gave you my winter preparations report for the orphanage. You might have ignored it since you were so focused on the skin glue\"\n\n\n \"Aaaah… that, that might be possible\"\n\n\n The glue made out of skin was much more interesting than the candles to Benno that he had all his mind place into it. The glue already existed in this world, but people usually bought what they needed when they had to, and no one did it outside of the workshops that needed glue for their products.\n\n\n \"Nobody in my neighborhood sells their candles because we are poor, but I was wondering if rich people salt their candles. Benno, are the candles you use yellow? or are they white?\"\n\n\n \"They are light yellow, half of it is fat and the other half is wax\".\n\n\n \"Tahat means that even rich people don't salt their candles, then\"\n\n\n Benno had mentioned that he used the money to take care of most of his winter preparations. If he wasn't familiarized with salted candles then, it should be safe to assume that nobody in the city should be.\n\n\n \"I simply buy my candles instead of making them, so you probably should sell that information to a wax workshop or a guild\".\n\n\n \"Ok, I'll sell the information to a wax workshop in the spring, I'll ask them to help me make some waxed paper too\"\n\n\n While we kept talking about the paper, we went through the bussy second floor from the merchants guild and went to the third. While Benno was speaking with the receptionist about the registration of the printing guild, Freida came out of a backroom with her apprentice uniform, her pink twin tales fluttering while smiling. Maybe due to her growth since the last time I saw her in the summer, she looked much more adult than what I remembered.\n\n\n \"Ah, ah! Is good to see you Myne\"\n\n\n \"Long time no see, Freida how are the cake sells doing?\"\n\n\n The last time I saw Freida was during the sampling event last summer. It was a big success, with the name <Pound cakes> and the diverse range of flavors spreading like a wildfire through the high-class society, skyrocketing Freida's and Leise's reputation in the process.\n\n\n \"they are selling magnificently - even the nobles love it. Many have asked if I have more sweets under my sleeve. Myne, would you like to answer their pledge? I'll buy the recipes at the right price for the market\" said Freida with a wide smile.\n\n\n I looked at Benno. the moment we made eye contact, he glared at me with a death stare, which I inmidiatly understood as \"no\". although, to be honest, I would have sold some recipes in the act if I were still broke. Having a financial margin is very important.\n\n\n \"I think Benno would kill me if I do, and I have enough money at this moment, so next time maybe\"\n\n\n She might have expected that Benno wouldn't give me permission since she only placed her hand on the chick and said \"oh well\" without looking dissapointed\n\n\n \"…I worried a lot when I heard you entered the Temple, but I can see you are doing well. Has devouring calm a bit? have you found a noble that wants to sign?\"\n\n\n \"Thank you for thinking about me. My devouring is ok now, but I'll definitely not sign with a noble, I prefer to be with my family\".\n\n\n \"Oh really? Surely there has been a lot of petitions for you\" said Freida, while tilting her head a bit confused.\n\n\n I was also confused; not a single noble had ask me about or anything of sorts. \"No one has made a petition for me, and in any casy I have no intention to sign with them. I mean I'm having a little brother on spring. How would I sign with a noble when I'm about to be an older sister?\" If i sign now I wouldn't be able to see his face. That's simply would be too much.\n\n\n \"My God, congratulations. Tell your mother I wish her the best. By the way come visit us when you are free Leise is waiting for your visit\".\n\n\n \"… Mm, I will be bussy for a while. There's so much I need to do\"\n\n\n I had been extremely bussy since I started to go to the temple. Excluding the days I had free due to sickness, I was so bussy that there was no day I could just relax at home.\n\n\n \"This new guild you are trying to make, does it has to do with the reason you are so bussy, Myne?\"\n\n\n \"Uh huh. Is what I want to do the most, so… \"\n\n\n We were using thick paper as template now, but I wish to start proper mimeographic printing and if possible I also wanted to try movable type printing. there is still a lot of work to do to upgrade the paper, without mentioning the ink. My mind was obseced with books, even though I'm bussy, I'm still having fun.\n\n\n \"It is what you want the most…? It involves books then?\"\n\n\n \"Yes!I finished my first book. I'm going to make and sell lots of them now. you should also buy some Freida\"\n\n\n \"I'm afraid I can't promise anything without seeing one first\" Freida answerd with a small smile lightly shaking her head.\n\n\n Not even our friendship was enough for her to buy one just by the pitch. just what I expected from an apprentice that even Benno has to raise his guard from-\n\n\n I took a kids bible from the ones that Lutz brought here and gave it to Freida. she has the insight of a rich lady raised by merchants, and I wanted to take advantage of this chance to hear what she thought about them.\n\n\n \"here, one of the books,What do you think about it?\"\n\n\n Benno must have thought the same since he stop filling the form and directed his eyes to Freida. She looked at the books with merchants eyes.\n\n\n \"… It is certantlya book\" remarked Freida while scamming the pages. \"But just the insides of one. it seems\"\n\n\n I had place flowers in the cover. but it seems that in the eyes of someone used to books a paper cover was as good as nothing.\n\n\n \"That page with the flower is the cover. The plan was for the clients to ask for the cover they wanted from their prefered workshop. Those who don't have a prefered workshop can ask for one to the Gilberta company.\n\n\n \"It's good I don't have to depend on Gilberta company favorite workshop\" said Freida, while looking at Benno \"How much is the book then?\"\n\n\n I looked at Benno so he could answer insted of me. I didn't know how much profit he wanted to get out of the books.\n\n\n \"A small gold and eight big silver, Intrested?\n\n\n \"Yes, happily\"\n\n\n Freida inmediatly touched cards with Benno to buy the kids Bible. I was surprised she was ok with buying it on the spot, but even more that Benno had the objective to make three big silver from each book. Maybe I should've rise the price to get a bit more money for myself.\n\n\n While I plunged in disappointment, mad with my self for not being a good enough merchant, Freida closed the book and smiled.\n\n\n \"Myne, I would recomend that your next book be about the Gods of each season. It has been really difficult to memorize the subordinates gods from the Five Central Gods\".\n\n\n The picture book I made discussed about the Darkness God and Light Godess, and the five central gods that made up the seasons. The multiple subordinate gods didn't appear at all. By making this reques, Freida was telling me what rich and noble children probably liked. Requests like this made easier the decition of what books to make next.\n\n\n \"Thanks for the idea Freida. My next book will be about the subordinate gods\". I wrote it down into my diptych, which made Freida ope her eyes a bit. She looked from above with her eyes focused on the pen.\n\n\n \"Myne, what is that? does Benno has the rights for it already?\"\n\n\n \"… You really have a nose for buisness, little girl\" Benno let out a sight of admiration while looking at Freida. who in turn exhale with disappointment.\n\n\n \"I trully lament that you found Myne before me, Benno. A sharp nose means nothing if the sweets at out of your reach\"."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Benno finished the paperwork while I talked with Freida. The registration would take a couple of days to be done, which meant our business in the merchants guild was over.\n\n\n \"Bye Frieda\"\n\n\n I said goodbye to Freida and started walking toward the stairs, but the second floor was filled with so many people that I needed Benno to carry me, to not end up crushed. The moment that Benno gave his first step, a loud shout was heard above the mumbling of the people.\n\n\n \"Wait! Please wait! Gilberta Company Girl!\", shouted a person, Benno and I look at one another.\n\n\n \"… Looks like Corina has some crazy fans\"\n\n\n \"Idiot, you are in my arms, He is definitely talking about you, ignoring reality won't make it go away\"\n\n\n But, I mean… I don't want to speak to someone that shouts in a place filled with people. Especially if he calls me <Gilberta Company Girl> when I'm not even Benno's daughter.\n\n\n \"I wouldn't like that everyone kept looking, lets go outside. If it is truly important he'll follow\" I told Benno while we head out.\n\n\n As expected, the person followed us. Benno stoped in the central plaza and put me down.\n\n\n I turned around to see a younger guy with bright orange hair tied behind his head come out of the Guild and start running here.\n\n\n Oh, that's Johann.\n\n\n As I reflected on the fact that I had always been wearing my Gilberta Company apprentice clothes when ordering stuff from Johann, he finally contacted us.\n\n\n \"What's your business?\", Benno asked behind me. Johann, who was now out of breath, knelt down in front of me and the fountain in the middle of the large crowd of passersby passing through the central square.\n\n\n \"Please become my patron!\"\n\n\n … Here we go again?!\n\n\n I could feel the crowd glaring daggers at us. I could even hear some whispering about what was going on, which made me feel unbearably uncomfortable.\n\n\n \"Um, Johann, there are a lot of people here, so maybe we should go to your workshop?\"\n\n\n \"No,\" Benno replied. \"If you have something to talk about, you can discuss it in my store.\"\n\n\n Benno rejected the idea of us going to Johann's store, instead, he said we should talk in his. I thought it would be best to avoid going there since Johann was confusing me with Benno's daughter, but I wasn't letting that fly.\n\n\n \"It will be better for you and me if I know what you are about to jump to next. Talk to me and Lutz over there.\"\n\n\n \"Good. In that case, Johann, would you come to the Gilberta Company for me?\", I asked, and Johann stood up, with sparkling eyes.\n\n\n \"Yes, of course, what father wouldn't be worried about sending his daughter to a workshop alone?\"\n\n\n \"He's not my father!\"\n\n\n \"She's not my daughter!\"\n\n\n Benno and I screamed at exactly the same time. When Johann's mouth dropped and his eyes opened, I took a firm step forward and looked at him.\n\n\n \"I am Myne. Benno helps me a lot, but he's not my father and I'm not even an apprentice in the Gilbert Company.\"\n\n\n \"What? But you're wearing apprentice clothes and you have a guild card\" Muttering in disbelief, Johann blanched and started listing all the reasons why he thought we were related.\n\n\n \"Myne is in charge of her own workshop and I am her financial tutor. Given her age, I assume you want to talk about your exam, right? then follow me.\" Benno spoke with a resigned sigh, then picked me up and started walking. That was exactly the kind of thing that made people think we were related, but I hated my slow walking speed too much to stop him. He walked entirely at his own pace, forcing Johann to walk briskly to keep up and causing Lutz to run.\n\n\n \"Hey, are those two really not related?\" Johann asked quietly to Lutz, refusing to give up on the matter.\n\n\n \"They aren't. Master Benno is single,\" Lutz replied in exasperation.\n\n\n Benno listened to their whispered conversation and looked at Johann, who jerked in fear and straightened up. I saw it all since I was looking over Benno's shoulder.\n\n\n When we entered Benno's office, Lutz followed Mark upstairs to go make tea. Johann, as a simple craftsman in a blacksmith's shop, had probably never been brought into the office of the owner of a large store before. He looked around sheepishly as he sat in the offered chair. It was hard to think that this was the same person who had boldly shouted, \"Please become my patron!\" In the middle of a busy square.\n\n\n \"Benno, what exam were you talking about?\", I asked as I leaned over the table, climbing into my chair.\n\n\n \"It's your business, Johann. You explain.\"\n\n\n Johann jerked and straightened his back once again as he was met by Benno's gaze. He looked between Benno and me several times as he searched for words. Finally, he took a deep breath and began.\n\n\n \"When a leherl in the Blacksmith's Guild comes of age, he has to pass a test to be recognized as an adult.\"\n\n\n Johann must not have been much of a skilled speaker, since he spoke in a quiet, deliberate tone as he searched for words. The test was to obtain one of the clients who recognized his ability to fund his efforts as a sponsor; the patron would give the leherl a task that would have to be completed within a year. Some customers would ask for weapons and others everyday items.\n\n\n More important than the task itself, however, was the patron they found. Of course, their satisfaction with the finished product was important, but what really mattered was ensuring continued support for the workshop in the future. If a smith failed the test, their leherl contract would become null and void, forcing them into the position of a lehange.\n\n\n \"But you're pretty good, Johann. Won't it be easy for you to find a patron?\" I asked curiously.\n\n\n Johann lowered his eyes before slowly shaking his head.\n\n\n \"I, I'm always so bothered by the details that customers don't like me too much.\"\n\n\n Johann wanted precise details about his orders and repeatedly asked questions to find out those details, leading customers to conclude that he lacked the necessary skill so he couldn't do anything without a tedious grasp. Somehow, it was not wrong to conclude that a mark of a skilled craftsman was the ability to make what a customer wanted based only on rough instructions, but Johann had the ability to make precise instructions come true and had more or less been doing all the precise orders his shop received alone.\n\n\n Naturally, Johann's workshop foreman didn't want to let him go, but there was nothing he could do if Johann didn't pass the Blacksmith's Guild test.\n\n\n \"I'm the only leherl in the whole Guild without a patron, and I'm coming of age in late fall, so I'm really at the end of my rope here.\"\n\n\n There was a baptism ceremony at the beginning of each season, and a coming of age ceremony at the end of each season. Given how late in the fall it was, Johann really didn't have much time left to find a patron.\n\n\n \"Sorry to keep you waiting, Master Benno.\"\n\n\n Lutz and Mark came downstairs with tea. Mark distributed the cups before leaving and Lutz moved behind Benno, who took a sip of tea before looking at Johann.\n\n\n \"Myne may be a client, but she's still a child. I'm sure your boss wasn't a fan of that,\" Benno said, making Johann shrink a little.\n\n\n \"He wasn't, but she's our only customer who brings me detailed plans\"\n\n\n It seemed most people were opposed to having someone minor like me as their sponsor, and there weren't many kids with a lot of money to use. But I had a guild card, respected Johann's talent, and had a history of placing large orders. On top of that, I happily answered Johann's detailed questions, praised his work, and specifically asked about him.\n\n\n It seemed that by applying for his work several times, I had qualified to become his sponsor. But since I was a minor, I would need the consent of a parent or guardian.\n\n\n \"You're the only one who can be my sponsor now. My foreman kicked me out of the shop and told me it would be a long shot, but I had to try.\"\n\n\n It seemed he had assumed that the daughter of a big store would be willing to become a sponsor for the demonstration while using her father's money. On top of that, Johann would gain the prestige of securing the Gilberta Company as a patron.\n\n\n \"To think you weren't really related\" Johann dropped his shoulders.\n\n\n Because Benno took me to the workshops and to the Merchants' Guild, as well as placing expensive orders while wearing Gilberta Company apprentice clothes, it seemed everyone had certainly thought I was his daughter. Which reminded me that Otto had mentioned that we looked like father and daughter to everyone around us. Given the age gap, I could hardly blame them.\n\n\n But to Benno, the bachelor, that was nothing but frustrating. He looked at me with harsh eyes.\n\n\n \"Of course Myne is not my daughter. I wouldn't raise a senseless idiot like her. My daughter would have at least as much common sense as Corinna,\" said Benno, who had raised his little sister after their parents died when they were little.\n\n\n I pursed my lips into a sharp pout and glared at him as hard as I could. But sadly, it bothered Benno more to be treated as my father than it did me as his daughter.\n\n\n \"I guess that means you can't be my sponsor, then\" Johann, picking up on the tense atmosphere, started to stand up with a defeated expression.\n\n\n But I grabbed his sleeve. I wanted something for him to do regardless of all this guild testing business. He needing a patron was just an added convenience.\n\n\n \"Benno, Benno. eh, eh, eh. There's something I want Johann to do.\" I smiled at Benno while still holding Johann's sleeve, and he rubbed his temples as he let out a sigh that told me he'd already seen it coming.\n\n\n \"Fine. I will give you my permission as your guardian and I will be the cosigner.\" Benno granted his permission as he waved a hand dismissively. The one who was most surprised to see him grant permission so casually was actually Johann.\n\n\n \"Um, if the sponsor runs out of money, the cosigner will have to-\"\n\n\n \"You think a merchant doesn't know what it means to be a cosigner? Don't worry. I don't need to worry about Myne running out of money. Cosigning for her hardly matters,\" Benno said with a shrug. He knew that even if I ran out of money, I could make it up by selling the books we were printing now, and my information about the candles would help smooth things over even more.\n\n\n \"You just got your hands on a customer who won't run out of money, you know.\"\n\n\n Every craftsman wanted a rich patron more than they could say. Benno's words made Johann light up with joy.\n\n\n \"That's amazing! Are you really going to be my patron, Myne? Uh, I mean Miss Myne?\" Johann hesitated as he pondered what to call me, earning him a light smack from Benno.\n\n\n \"Hey, don't you know you're supposed to respect your customers? I know she's just a little girl in looks and age, but she's paying to keep you alive. Call her Lady Myne if you know what's good for you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm sorry. Lady Myne, then.\" Johann hastily corrected himself.\n\n\n I smiled and waved my hand to say that he didn't have to worry about that - I don't worry about what people were calling me. Titles were not important to me, but the task I was about to give him was.\n\n\n \"All right, Johann. I think I'll have the catalog and detailed plans of what I want you to do in your workshop by tomorrow.\"\n\n\n If I put my all into it, I could probably finish the production process and the finer details on the plans by the end of today. I clenched my fists with determination as Johann blinked in surprise.\n\n\n \"Huh? Catalog?\" what, various things? B-But the test is only supposed to be doing one thing.\"\n\n\n \"Well, it is one thing. All metal punch letters belong to one set.\"\n\n\n The thirty-five-letter alphabet in this world had uppercase and lowercase letters just like English, which were similar to Japanese hiragana and katakana. Naturally, it would need letter perforations for uppercase and lowercase letters; after all, the terms \"uppercase\" and \"lowercase\" were historically derived from where cases containing such perforations were arranged in print. Fifty of each vowel sound and twenty of each consonant should suffice.\n\n\n \"If I'm going to be your sponsor, I want you to make metal punch letters. I imagine it will be quite an arduous task since each one has unique details and there are so many of them, but hey, that's the way it is. Do you regret choosing me as your sponsor?\"\n\n\n I gave a brief explanation of what the punch-lettered ones were, which made Johann blink in surprise. He looked at Benno and Lutz for help, and the two looked at each other before exchanging slight winks.\n\n\n \"Listen to what people tell you. I told you she'd be a good sponsor because she won't run out of money, right? You should have thought about why I didn't say anything else,\" Benno said.\n\n\n \"If you don't think you can keep up with Myne's craziness, you should give up now and find someone else. She's always like that,\" Lutz added.\n\n\n It was hard to tell if they were giving him warnings or words of support. Either way, Johann clenched his fists in his lap and closed his eyes tightly. After a moment of deep thought, he looked at me with eyes full of determination.\n\n\n \"I will. Become my sponsor.\"\n\n\n I got things up and running and finished the plans and detailed instructions before the end of the day. I then brought them to Johann's workshop the next morning. Judging by how surprised he seemed when I arrived, he shouldn't have expected me to complete the plans so quickly, but they got him so excited that I was sure he'd be fine.\n\n\n \"Looks like we're one step closer to mobile type printing, Lutz.\"\n\n\n \"… It sure looks like you're having fun, Myne.\"\n\n\n \"If we can overcome this challenge, movable type printing will be just around the corner. Once Johann has finished the stroke lettering, I will modify a presser foot to make an actual printer. However, that will be in the spring. I need to spend the winter making a lot of money.\""

    "content": " \n\n\n\n As the fall came to an end, we finished printing our second batch of children's Bibles. I set aside the twenty we were going to use as textbooks and sold the other forty to Benno, earning six large golds. After months of being just over the poverty line, I was suddenly rich\n\n\n Not long after, Fran and Rosina came to my quarters to talk about my family, about the upcoming winter, and using the money earned from the picture books to further complete our winter preparations. And with that, I, my family, and the orphanage had completed our respective winter preparations, just as the weather cooled enough that it looked like it would snow at any moment.\n\n\n Lutz gave me a report as we headed home from the temple.\n\n\n \"Myne, Master Benno said that the head of the Ink Guild and the foreman of the ink shop came to see you this morning.\"\n\n\n \"…I guess they noticed the new ink we're using?\"\n\n\n As predicted, wealthy people with connections to the nobles were beginning to buy the children's bibles from the Gilberta Company. One could tell at a glance that the ink used was not normal ink; there was a big difference between the blue-colored walnut ink and the solid black paint ink made from soot and oil.\n\n\n Naturally, the Ink Guild noticed this immediately and started looking for who had done it, but no one in the guild knew anything. No one, except the foreman of the ink shop I had visited, that is.\n\n\n \"They said that a girl from the Gilberta Company knew how to make a different kind of ink.\"\n\n\n That revelation sent the head of the Ink Guild and the foreman in question straight to the Gilberta Company - specifically to ask Benno if he intended to make another Ink Guild for his new ink.\n\n\n The Gilberta Company had a precedent for making new guilds. They had fought against the Parchment Guild to make the Vegetable Paper Guild and the accompanying workshops, which now filled the market with vegetable paper, somewhat cheaper than parchment. Although there was an agreement that parchment would continue to be used for official contracts, vegetable paper surpassed it to a large extent because it could be mass-produced; it only made sense that those with a personal interest in ink would be on guard after Benno began using different ink on plant paper to sell books.\n\n\n \"Master Benno wants you to come to the store tomorrow. He has something to talk to you about.\"\n\n\n \"Okay.\"\n\n\n That was standard business for me, and the next day Lutz and I went to the Gilberta Company first before going to the temple.\n\n\n \"Good morning, Benno.\"\n\n\n \"There you are, Myne. Good to see you coming.\"\n\n\n Benno gestured for me to sit at the table as Lutz went up the back stairs. As a leherl, Lutz was practicing how to prepare and serve tea to visitors.\n\n\n \"As I expected, the Ink Guild came to ask. You said you wanted to teach them how to make ink and then let them do it all, right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. If you continue to expand your business into all these other fields, it will only create more enemies for you, and ink making really has nothing to do with the Gilberta Company's main line of work. As long as they let Myne's Workshop continue to make their own ink, I wouldn't mind selling off the production process and letting them take care of the rest.\"\n\n\n Mass production of ink will be important to spread printing around the world, but trying to manage both processes on our own might end up being too difficult to handle. It would make more sense to me to let other people take over these jobs when possible.\n\n\n \"How much money are you thinking?\"\n\n\n \"Mmm, as much as I'm giving the temple, so… How about ten percent of the profits?\"\n\n\n My suggestion made Benno shake his head with a grimace.\n\n\n \"You're setting it too low.\"\n\n\n \"But the profits will increase as the ink spreads, and I want you to sell the ink at a low price just like the vegetable paper sells at a low price.\"\n\n\n My thought process was entirely based on spreading the product as far as possible, but Benno dismissed the idea with a wave of his hand.\n\n\n \"At least raise it to thirty percent for the first ten years. Then you can reduce it to twenty percent for the ten years after that, then ten percent for the rest of the time. That's just why I'm bringing you to the table. You shouldn't sell new technology that low.\"\n\n\n \"Okay. I'll leave the percentages to you.\"\n\n\n Benno was certainly going with thirty percent rather than something much higher to accommodate me. I knew he had my best interests in mind, so I felt comfortable leaving all that to him.\n\n\n \"Here's the tea.\" Lutz came down the stairs, looking tense as he placed cups in front of us.\n\n\n Benno took his cup, examining its contents with a sharp look in his eyes before taking a sip.\n\n\n \"… It's still not there.\"\n\n\n \"Definitely not the best, but it's getting better. Lutz, do you want Fran to help you a little? He's a good teacher; both Gil and Delia are much better at making tea now.\"\n\n\n \"That sounds good… Haaah.\"\n\n\n Lutz was working hard under Mark's supervision, but his tea wasn't good enough to serve other visitors yet. For now, he was practicing on me.\n\n\n \"That just leaves the magic contract.\"\n\n\n \"Do you think we should use it?\"\n\n\n Contract magic was expensive enough that it was generally only used when nobles were involved. Benno had signed magic contracts with me twice before, but both times he was thinking long term and laying the groundwork to protect me from nobles. But this time we were only dealing with the Ink Guild, which as far as I knew didn't have any nobles.\n\n\n \"The deal we're making will last a long time and involve a lot of money. It's worth it, and personally, I don't trust the leader of the Ink Guild. I might as well play it safe with contract magic, this will be a contract with the Ink Guild itself, not with him.\"\n\n\n \"A contract with the Ink Guild?\"\n\n\n It seemed that the groups were also seen as separate legal entities in this world. I tilted my head in thought and Benno nodded slowly.\n\n\n \"Yep. It will be important to ensure that the contract remains in place even when the head eventually changes.\"\n\n\n There seemed to be many historical cases where people who assumed positions of power decided not to honor the contracts their predecessor had signed. It had happened enough times for the judicial system to develop the concept of legal personhood.\n\n\n \"We are going to sell the ink production process to the guild. They will let Myne's Workshop continue to make their own ink. We will make the price of ink cheap so that it will spread along with the vegetable paper. We get thirty percent of their profit from the ink. That amount will change every ten years. Sound good?\"\n\n\n \"Be sure to tell them that the ink is not good for use on parchment as it doesn't absorb much.\"\n\n\n After confirming the details with Benno and Lutz, Mark called and came in.\n\n\n \"Master Benno, two visitors from the Ink Guild are here.\"\n\n\n \"Let them in once I ring the bell.\"\n\n\n \"As you wish.\"\n\n\n Mark left the room.\n\n\n Benno immediately stood up and set me down from my chair with a grim expression. He then lifted his chin toward Lutz, who responded with a silent nod before opening the inner door to the stairs.\n\n\n \"Myne, I'll negotiate with the Ink Guild. You don't want to be seen. Stay with Corinna and I'll send you the magic contract to sign once it's all written down.\"\n\n\n \"…Why jump through so many hoops to hide?\"\n\n\n I thought it would be rather strange to sign a contract with one of the parties absent. I blinked in surprise, and after glancing over to where the visitors were probably waiting in the other room, Benno explained in a low, dark voice.\n\n\n \"The shop foreman might be okay, but the guild boss has connections with the nobles and I don't hear a lot of good things about him. There are a lot of bad rumors. You'd better not let him see you.\"\n\n\n \"Good. I'll trust you on this.\"\n\n\n I was very curious about this Ink Guild master, but I went ahead and climbed the stairs to Corinna's room with Lutz. Once there, he immediately turned to go back downstairs, as it was his job to deliver the magic contract paper.\n\n\n \"Lutz, tell me how the head of the Ink Guild is later, okay?\"\n\n\n \"Yeah, sure.\"\n\n\n After dismissing Lutz, I turned to Corinna.\n\n\n \"I'm sorry, Corinna. I just barged in out of nowhere.\"\n\n\n \"It's okay, Myne. Let's take this opportunity to do the temporary stitching on your tunic.\"\n\n\n \"Right. Sorry to give you such a big job to do so quickly.\"\n\n\n Corinna led me into the living room with a kind expression. On the way we saw Otto in the hallway, who greeted us with a friendly greeting. He must have been off work today as Dad was.\n\n\n \"Sheesh, Myne. I can't believe you're making Corinna work hard for an arch noble when she's pregnant.\"\n\n\n \"Otto, how many times have I told you to keep your nose out of my work?\"\n\n\n \"I'm just worried about you, Corinna.\"\n\n\n Otto did not back down even after receiving a hard look from Corinna. They were as loving as ever.\n\n\n I watched Corinna pull Otto out of the room like a petulant child, wondering if Otto was actually causing her headaches instead of her pregnancy.\n\n\n \"I'm worried about you too, Corinna. has Otto gone overboard lately? He and dad are famous on the gate for being madly in love. is he so excited about his first baby that he's causing problems…\"\n\n\n \"My God, is that's what people say about him? I imagine your mother has it as hard as I do then. \"Corinna burst out laughing and brought in some blue cloth, which she began to spread out on a large table.\n\n\n \"Do you think you'll be able to finish the ceremonial robes? You really haven't been given enough time.\"\n\n\n \"It will certainly be a struggle; The workshop is very busy. But it's still rare that we get work from the archnobles, so our seamstresses are giving it their all. We charge them quite a lot, after all.\"\n\n\n It seemed that while making the fabric for my first set of tunics, they had also dyed extra fabric in the same color to use for another order placed by someone else. They were using that extra fabric now, and apparently, everyone in the shop was working at full speed on the embroidery.\n\n\n \"We still have to do the first fitting for that other order, which gives us plenty of time to dye new fabric before the deadline. But we were told to finish these tunics as soon as possible, and while we don't have time to use a different fabric for the first fitting, I can't imagine it's grown enough that the measurements will be too different from the last time.\"\n\n\n As I spoke, Corinna fitted me with the blue fabric with pinning needles. It was hard for her to do with her big belly, and it seemed like everything she did was a struggle for her.\n\n\n \"I'm sorry, Myne. I'll have to call a maid to help me. This is too much for me on my own.\"\n\n\n \"Your belly really is big now. Is it almost time?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, I was told to expect it in mid-winter. The baby is quite energetic, he's always rolling around in there. Maybe it's a boy?\" Corinna rubbed her big belly as she rang a bell to call a maid.\n\n\n But it was Otto who came in, saying \"You called?\" And he seemed eager to help. I couldn't help but laugh at Corinna's exasperated expression.\n\n\n \"You know, now that Myne has stolen Benno from us, I think it's time for me to quit and accept my new life working for the Gilberta Company.\"\n\n\n \"Um, Otto, what do you mean I stole Benno from you?\"\n\n\n I don't even have the arm strength to lift Benno, let alone carry him anywhere.\n\n\n \"It means what it means. As his financial guardian, Benno plans to continue expanding his business. That's why he's in the middle of beating how the Gilberta Company works into my head,\" Otto said with a shrug as he began to help Corinna. He was actually doing a pretty good job, a sign that he had been working hard to learn.\n\n\n \"Otto, you look so in your element here that I almost forget you're a soldier. At this rate, it won't be a long time before you open your own store with Corinna, huh?\"\n\n\n \"… Well, it'll be a few years at least. I'll work hard for Corinna and for the sake of our baby.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, yes, dear. Work your hands, not your mouth.\"\n\n\n Corinna finished the temporary stitching while giving Otto instructions. The length was fine, so we decided to go with the same measurements and everything as last time. Then she chased Otto out again and fixed my hair, which had been messed up by the temporary seams.\n\n\n As I was putting my top layer of clothes back on a knock sounded from further into the house, followed by Mark announcing himself. We could hear the footsteps of someone walking to let Mark in; I hurriedly finished dressing and nodded as Mark knocked on the living room door.\n\n\n \"Please come in.\"\n\n\n \"Excuse me, Corinna.\" Mark entered with a sheet of paper and a jar of ink. He spread the magic contract on the round table and confirmed each point with me. It was almost exactly what I had discussed with Benno, and the numbers in our favor showed that Benno had won the negotiations.\n\n\n There was only one point I didn't recognize. A line that said, \"The contents of this contract will be recorded in the Ink Guild bylaws.\"\n\n\n \"Mark, what does this part of the Ink Guild regulations mean?\"\n\n\n \"All workshops belonging to a guild must abide by the guild's rules. In short, the contents of the contract recorded in the Ink Guild regulations mean that they will also apply to Ink Guilds and ink workshops in other cities.\"\n\n\n The magic contract itself was only magically binding in Ehrenfest, but the guild regulations were maintained in all cities. As such, although there were several different Ink Guilds, they all followed the same regulations - although there were slight variations in the rules depending on the city and workshop in question. To my way of thinking, the guild regulations were very similar to the federal law that existed in addition to the regional laws.\n\n\n \"But how would the Ink Guilds in other cities know to enforce these rules, is there any line of communication between then?\"\n\n\n \"They are buying the production process of this ink precisely because it will be profitable for them. It is natural for this Ink Guild to send a message to their fellow Ink Guilds in neighboring cities. They will amend their copy of the regulations after learning about the production process.\"\n\n\n I nodded at Mark's explanation and grabbed the ink. The contract already had Benno's name and a line for the Ink Guild, but the guildmaster's name had not yet been written. I wrote my name as close to the bottom as possible.\n\n\n \"So, Lutz, what kind of person was the head of the Ink Guild?\"\n\n\n \"… He had a nasty look in his eyes. He was looking for you.\"\n\n\n \"Bwuh?\"\n\n\n Lutz clenched his fists and explained, speaking softly.\n\n\n \"He told Master Benno that he knew a girl had brought out the new ink in the workshop. He said 'Let me see her if she is here.' I think Master Benno was right to hide you…… He felt much worse than the guild master.\"\n\n\n If Lutz was saying that this man was much worse than the guild master, it must have been really bad. Lutz and Benno both on guard around him was a sign that I should be on guard too.\n\n\n \"But anyway, Myne. Hold out your hand,\" Lutz said, readying his knife.\n\n\n I grimaced as I remembered that the contract magic needed blood, then held out my hand. A sudden sharp pain shot through the tip of my finger and the blood came out. I pressed it against the contract which then burst into a golden flame, burned the paper, and sealed the deal. It seemed as magical as ever.\n\n\n \"Myne,\" Mark said, \"wait here quietly until Master Benno calls for you.\"\n\n\n \"I know, Mark.\"\n\n\n With the contract signed, I passed the time talking to Corinna about her baby and ignoring Otto's crying about how I couldn't help him with the work over the winter.\n\n\n It was about lunch when Benno came running up the stairs with an angry look in his eyes.\n\n\n \"Myne, I sent Mark to take Lutz home and call your father and sister to come get you. Don't even think about leaving until they're here! \"\n\n\n \"…What, did something happen!\" I stood up and ran over to Benno, who looked out the window with a frown on his face.\n\n\n \"I sent Lutz on an errand to the Merchants Guild, and on the way, some men joined him. They started asking questions about 'the Gilberta Company girl'. He said he must know about you as he is a leherl and mentioned the contract.\"\n\n\n \"That must mean they are…\" I paused, and Benno nodded deliberately.\n\n\n \"They must have been from the Ink Guild, but I can't understand why they would start looking for information after signing the contract.\"\n\n\n It made sense that they would want to gather information beforehand to help them get better terms for themselves or something, but the contract was already signed. They had cornered Lutz even though that would obviously put us on our guard, and we had no idea why. And there was no greater fear, than fear of the unknown.\n\n\n \"… There may be something going on behind the scenes here. Keep your eyes and ears open out there.\"\n\n\n \"Okay.\"\n\n\n \"Myne, we're here.\"\n\n\n \"Dad! Tuuli!\"\n\n\n They had both been off work and, judging by how heavy their breathing was, they must have been rushing here at full speed.\n\n\n \"My apologies for calling you,\" Benno said to Dad, rising from his seat.\n\n\n \"No, I appreciate you going out of your way to protect my daughter, do you mind if I ask you what the hell is going on?\"\n\n\n \"The Ink Guild has definitely seen her, but I don't know who's pulling the strings,\" Benno explained. \"The fact that they're looking for information after the contract signing is strange, and the fact that they're after Lutz just doesn't make sense.\"\n\n\n I could see my father's eyes harden. Tuuli, who looked nervous, gave me a tight hug.\n\n\n \"I think Myne will be safer if you send her to the temple now,\" Benno continued. \"I'll leave the decision up to you and your wife, but they won't be able to do anything to her if she's at the temple. It will also give us time to look for information ourselves.\"\n\n\n \"… Agreed.\"\n\n\n Dad nodded gravely, then lifted me up with a frown.\n\n\n \"What do you think, Myne, do you want to go to the temple, or do you want to go home?\"\n\n\n Honestly, I wanted Dad to take me home so I wouldn't be alone. But that would make it more likely that these people would go after Lutz and my family.\n\n\n \"… I don't want to leave so soon, but I don't want anything to happen to you or Lutz even more. I'll go to the temple. The snow will start soon, anyway.\"\n\n\n I put on a brave face, but the thought of living in the temple made me indescribably nervous. I squeezed Dad's shirt tightly.\n\n\n And so began my winter in the temple."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Dad and Tuuli took me to my rooms in the temple, where Fran greeted us with wide eyes. He looked between them and me, blinking rapidly.\n\n\n \"Did something happen, Sister Myne?\"\n\n\n \"Sorry to barge in like this, Fran.\"\n\n\n He started to usher me in, but I stopped him and told him I didn't want Delia to overhear before I started explaining the situation at the door. I explained that the head of the Ink Guild was targeting me, that Lutz was approached by a group of men, and that he would start living in the temple a little earlier than planned for security reasons.\n\n\n I also mentioned that while we didn't know what the Ink Guild boss was after, we did know that he had connections to the nobles and a lot of bad rumors surrounding him, which meant we should avoid mentioning this to Delia - especially since he apparently didn't even know my name (nor did I know his name).\n\n\n Fran listened to everything with a frown and then nodded deliberately.\n\n\n \"Understood. I'd ask you to tell the Head Priest what you told me.\"\n\n\n \"Fran,\" Dad began, squeezing his hand on my shoulder, \"let's try to figure out what's going on here. For now, I'll leave Myne with you. But I'll be back to check on her.\"\n\n\n Fran nodded and looked back around at him. \"You can count on me. Your visits will no doubt be the warmth that keeps Sister Myne going through the winter.\"\n\n\n \"Myne, don't be too difficult with them. And be sure to tell the Head Priest everything. Nothing good comes from lack of communication with your boss.\"\n\n\n Dad gave me some very soldier-like advice, to which I responded with a smile and two bumps of my right fist against the left side of my chest. His expression softened, then he gave a similar salute.\n\n\n Tuuli gave me a tight hug, then looked at me with his big green eyes wavering with trepidation.\n\n\n \"Goodbye, Myne. I'll come by on my next day off. Be good while I'm gone, okay?\"\n\n\n \"Okay. I'll be waiting for you.\"\n\n\n After saying goodbye to Dad and Tuuli, I went into my quarters. Despite having my own room here, spending the night in the temple made me a little nervous. All my attendants were surprised to see me arrive out of nowhere just before dinner time.\n\n\n \"What brings you here today, Sister Myne?\"\n\n\n \"Due to certain circumstances, my winter stay at the temple has been moved up and will now begin today.\"\n\n\n \"What circumstances?\" asked Delia, her head tilted to one side.\n\n\n I shook my head.\n\n\n \"I can't give any details as nobles might be involved.\"\n\n\n Delia tried to start changing me into my blue tunic, but I stopped her since I had no plans to go out today. That said, I didn't have much else to do. I looked around the room, thinking about how I used to be at home at this point.\n\n\n \"What does everyone do when it gets so late?\"\n\n\n I noticed what Rosina did without even looking - she was playing her harspiel. She actually played as long as she could before the seventh curfew of the bell.\n\n\n Delia was carrying hot water from the kitchen, probably to prepare the bath. It seemed that bath time was where women polished their charms; I had a lot to learn from Delia's girl power.\n\n\n Gil was writing a report on his whiteboard about the Myne Workshop activity for the day and the products he had finished. It was a report based on how the Gilberta Company handled their stock, and Lutz was having Gil write them as part of his training.\n\n\n Fran was finalizing reports on the food and supplies consumed by the orphanage and my rooms so that he could prepare orders for more stock. He was busy every day with all kinds of different paperwork. Still, he said things were much easier for him now that he could split the work with Rosina and Wilma.\n\n\n \"… I think I will write a letter to the Head Priest requesting a meeting with him.\"\n\n\n I sat down at my desk and began writing a letter to the Head Priest, asking to speak with him so I could tell him what had happened. However, it would be days before he would respond, so who knows how long it would be before we could talk.\n\n\n After finishing my letter, I began planning the next few picture books. Guided by Freida's advice, I decided to make new children's bibles with stories of the subordinate gods below the Five Eternals, organized by their season.\n\n\n I ate a fancy dinner delivered to my table, took a luxurious bath in hot water with Delia's help, and then crawled into my warm bed alone. It was so big that I could stretch my arms and legs as much as I wanted. Beside me, I could see a table with a pitcher of water, a cup, and a bell to summon my attendants.\n\n\n \"Good night, Sister Myne.\"\n\n\n \"Good night, Delia. Good night, Rosina.\"\n\n\n The curtain for which surrounded my canopied bed closed, leaving me alone in my wide bed in complete darkness. Despite the delicious food, the bath full of warm water for which no one was mad at me, and the comfortable bed with plenty of room, I would rather have eaten around the table with my family, bathed in a shallow tub that had only a little warm water while playing with Tuuli, and slept in a smaller bed while clinging to my family for extra warmth.\n\n\n … Getting homesick after a single day of travel sure is sluggish.\n\n\n I had attendants, but there was a firm line between us: I was their master and they were my servants. They would treat me with respect, but I was not allowed to get emotionally involved with them. I was trapped in bed, sadder and lonelier than I could describe, shaken by fear of whoever it was that attacked me.\n\n\n The morning at the temple came late. Or to be more precise, the morning came early for the attendants, while I, on the other hand, was stuck in bed waiting for them to finish preparing breakfast. If I tried to get up before they finished, Delia would angrily yell at me saying that I had to go back to sleep until I was called. That's when I learned that the noble daughters had to pretend to be asleep in bed until their attendants were ready for them.\n\n\n Would they get mad if I sneakily read books to pass the time?\n\n\n \"Now then, let's start practicing.\"\n\n\n After a light breakfast, it was time to practice the harspiel with Rosina. She set up the instruments with a smile, commenting how wonderful it was that she no longer had to wait for me to arrive at the temple.\n\n\n By the time she and I began practicing, Delia and Gil were cleaning the room and drawing water while Fran went to the Head Priest to deliver my letter and give a brief summary of the situation. When he returned, he said that the Head Priest had given me a strict order to remain in my quarters until further notice while he investigated the situation. It seemed that I would spend my days; not only trapped in the temple, but also trapped in my quarters.\n\n\n \"You are a surprisingly good teacher, Sister Myne. Muuuch more easier to understand than Gil.\"\n\n\n \"You think so? Maybe I should teach at the temple school too,\" I said, my voice coming out a little shy since I wasn't used to being complimented by Delia.\n\n\n Fran gave me a somewhat dubious look and asked me what the \"temple school\" was.\n\n\n \"A place of education where I will teach the children to read and write.\"\n\n\n \"… Is this plan written in stone?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, I've already made plans to hold sessions throughout the winter.\"\n\n\n Fran blinked repeatedly in surprise, then slowly shook his head.\n\n\n \"Sister Myne, I don't think you've briefed me on that. Please explain exactly what you plan to do and in what manner.\"\n\n\n \"What? But it's all written right here.\"\n\n\n I pulled out my winter time sheet and handed it to Fran. He looked at it and then muttered, \"This is going to be the temple school…?\" With lowered eyes.\n\n\n It seemed he hadn't fully understood me when I told him I was going to educate the children. He had thought that Tuuli's sewing classroom and her teaching them how to do winter work would be the extent of their education.\n\n\n \"But you know,\" Gil interjected, \"I don't know how much you'll need to teach them, Sister Myne. They can already read a little thanks to the karuta and picture books you gave me.\" He shrugged and I hesitated, stumbling over my words.\n\n\n \"I want them to learn to write too. It will be easier for them to work for the nobles as assistants if they can read and write, surely. And if they know how to count and do math, they will even be able to manage the workshop and the orphanage by themselves. I think knowing these things is better than not knowing them.\"\n\n\n I mentioned the workshop report Gil had been writing yesterday, which made my point click with everyone. Gil was still bad at reading big numbers, so he had been writing his reports with the help of the gray priests.\n\n\n \"Sister Myne, where do you plan to hold this temple school?\"\n\n\n \"In the orphanage dining room, both boys and girls can participate. I will be the teacher.\"\n\n\n \"Please leave the teaching to the gray priests. That kind of activity is beneath you, Sister Myne.\"\n\n\n Fran and Rosina shot down my idea together. I was stuck working behind the scenes, as usual.\n\n\n Finally, I decided to do something like a school curriculum, which I would teach Delia first in my rooms. Fran and Rosina would learn from my example, then they themselves would teach in the dining room. They would also train grey priests who were formerly assistants to teach, then stop when the time was right, thus establishing the temple school.\n\n\n …Damn. I wanted to be a teacher since apparently, I'm really good at it.\n\n\n For the temple school, I set a goal of teaching all the children to write the alphabet and add and subtract with single digit numbers. I had plenty of stone slates and slate pencils at the ready, not to mention the children's bibles to use as textbooks.\n\n\n The fourth bell rang once, not long after I had worked out the general flow of how things would go. I had lunch and was having tea when Lutz visited.\n\n\n \"Are you holding up well, Myne?\"\n\n\n He had finally been given the go-ahead to visit me after Benno did a thorough check to make sure no one suspicious was following him.\n\n\n I ran downstairs and ran to Lutz as he waved to me from the hallway.\n\n\n \"Lutz, give me a hug!\"\n\n\n \"Woah!\"\n\n\n I jumped into Lutz's arms, demanding a hug; I had been so starved for warmth that I needed him to recharge me. In my days as a Uranus I had been fine with nothing but books in my life, but maybe because of adjusting to this girl's body, or maybe because I was getting used to my family hugging me, I now craved the warmth of other people.\n\n\n \"I'm so lonely without my family here. I want to go home already.\"\n\n\n \"It's only been one night, you know?\" Lutz smiled in exasperation at my complaint and shook his head, but I couldn't help how I felt.\n\n\n \"I'll get used to it eventually. This is the loneliest I'll be all winter.\"\n\n\n \"I don't know about that - who's to say it might not just get worse and worse?\"\n\n\n \"… If it gets worse than this, I could die of loneliness.\"\n\n\n I was stuck in my rooms without even the option of going to the reading room to read, and there were no books in my rooms other than the children's bibles. If I had to continue living without my family here, I might well lose the will to live.\n\n\n \"… That doesn't sound like a joke, because you always end up close to dying when I take my eyes off you.\"\n\n\n \"I'm going to hang on and survive the loneliness, so I want you to bear with this and let me hug you.\"\n\n\n \"Good, good.\"\n\n\n Lutz let me cling to him until I was satisfied. Then, with my arms still around him, he looked at the report Gil had written and compared it to his own, pointing out any errors in his calculations.\n\n\n I received several complaints from my assistants as I steadied my emotions by clinging to Lutz. Some of them I remember:\n\n\n \"How brazen!\"\n\n\n \"A proper woman would never…\"\n\n\n \"Geez! You should at least pursue a rich, noble guy with lots of money.\"\n\n\n \"Why don't you trust me like that, Sister Myne…?\"\n\n\n But I ignored them all. The winter ahead of me would be long and cold; So for the sake of my mental health, I needed warmth from where ever I could find it.\n\n\n \"Right. Myne, the shop is out of things to do; What's our next step, starting the winter work?\"\n\n\n The second round of printing was over, and although we had the templates to print more, there was no more paper to turn into books. We couldn't make any more either since the river was freezing now. Not to mention that now that winter preparations were done, we would be running out of soot for our ink.\n\n\n \"Good. I'll explain what the winter work will be like, so could you go get the tools and boards for reversi from the workshop?\"\n\n\n \"Sure. Let's go, Gil.\"\n\n\n \"Okay.\"\n\n\n Lutz and Gil returned with boards and tools. They laid them on the table in the hallway and I began to explain how to make reversi boards and disks.\n\n\n \"These thick boards are what we're going to use as game boards. Using a ruler and a pen, keep drawing straight lines until you have eight squares by eight squares,\" I explained, drawing example lines on the board using my own pen.\n\n\n \"Once you draw the lines, cut grooves along them with one of the ones you dug, draw the lines again with ink. You'll just trace the grooves, so I think the ink should stay inside them pretty well, but be careful not to let anything splatter.\"\n\n\n \"Good.\"\n\n\n \"Cut the thin boards into sixty-four squares to match the size of the squares on the game board, then polish them so they're smooth and nice to the touch. After that, just cover one side with ink, so once you're done cutting them, all the hard work is over.Also…\"\n\n\n I explained that for fake shogi, or rather fake chess, I cut the board as I would for reversi. But instead of covering one side, I'll write a letter over them. That made Lutz grimace.\n\n\n \"Hey, Myne, do you think we could print the letters instead?\"\n\n\n \"Why?\"\n\n\n \"Not many people at the orphanage can write, and not everyone who can is that good. These letters will be small, and I think it will be a problem if the handwriting is too bad to read.\"\n\n\n \"Mmm, good point… I guess I'll make a template for it.\"\n\n\n Lutz wrote all the steps on his diptych as I continued. I myself wrote down the things I would need to improve or think about in my own diptych.\n\n\n Gil, who had been watching our usual discussion, looked at Lutz with his purple eyes.\n\n\n \"…Have you been having Sister Myne teach you all that, Lutz?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. She can't work in the workshop since she's a blue shrine maiden, so she has to teach me what to do ahead of time so I can make sure the workshop runs properly.\"\n\n\n \"I thought you knew everything and were amazing, but it's actually Sister Myne who is amazing.\" Gil pouted with puffy cheeks.\n\n\n I nudged them with my finger.\n\n\n \"Gil, Lutz is really amazing. He only needs to listen to my explanation once before he can repeat it in the workshop and get things done. Now you were listening too, but you wouldn't be able to teach someone else what to do, would you?\"\n\n\n \"…I wouldn't.\" Gil looked at the floor, then raised his head and pointed to Lutz's diptych. \"But that's only because I don't have a diptych! It would be awesome if I had one, too!\"\n\n\n \"Oh, right, you've learned to read and write now. I guess you'll need one soon if you're going to write those workshop reports. I can't get out now, but I'll get one for you when spring comes.\"\n\n\n \"Really!!! All right, I'm definitely going to beat Lutz!\" Gil raised his head and declared himself Lutz's rival, getting a casual reply, \"Good luck winning before spring.\" It looked like Lutz would be going with Benno to the neighboring towns next spring to check out the vegetable paper shops; he wished Gil would run the entire Myne shop before then.\n\n\n \"Oh, right,\" Lutz added. \"Next time I come here, there will be an apprentice with me. Aaah, he's actually pretty close to the age of majority, but yeah.\"\n\n\n \"Why, is he going to take your place while you're gone?\" I tilted my head in confusion, and Lutz frowned a little.\n\n\n \"On paper, he's here to help with the workshop like me, but Master Benno really wants him to learn how to act as an assistant.\"\n\n\n \"Right. He mentioned that he wanted waiters for his Italian restaurant.\" I added a note in my diptych to plan for that as well.\n\n\n \"… Hey, Myne. I've got reversi and all that, but what about letters?\"\n\n\n \"I wish we had different color ink to use here, but there's no point in wishing for the impossible. We'll just use regular black ink for now.\"\n\n\n I drew the four sets of cards and the nine numbers used on my stone slate, then drew three diamonds in the middle of a large rectangle as an example.\n\n\n \"We'll make four different sets of cards, one for each symbol, and we'll differentiate the cards in each set using numbers.\"\n\n\n \"That's going to be a lot of cards,\" Lutz said.\n\n\n \"Hey, that symbol looks a bit like a divine instrument,\" Gil observed proudly as he pointed to the diamond symbols. \"It's like the spear of Leidenschaft. And that other one looks like Flutrane's staff.\"\n\n\n According to him, the diamonds resembled the spear of the God of Fire, while the swords resembled the staff of the Goddess of Water. Now that he mentioned it, the decoration around the tip of the divine spear and the magic stones of the divine staff resembled those shapes.\n\n\n \"In that case, Gil, what about Schutzaria, the Goddess of Wind?\"\n\n\n \"Her shield is a circle, so none of these fit. The symbol of Geduldh, the Earth Goddess, is the chalice, so it would look like this…\"\n\n\n It appeared that a circle symbolized the shield of the Wind Goddess, while an inverted triangle symbolized the chalice of the Earth Goddess. That covered all four letters perfectly, and the change would probably make those in the temple more likely to accept them.\n\n\n On Gil's recommendation, I changed the card suits to swords, diamonds, circles and inverted triangles.\n\n\n \"I think I'll make the jack, queen and king cards symbols, too, then. Drawing art for each would be a pain anyway.\"\n\n\n I replaced the jack with a sword to symbolize the God of Life, the queen with a crown to symbolize the Goddess of Light, and the king with a black cloak to symbolize the God of Darkness. The main goal here was to make the designs as simple as possible.\n\n\n I thought about what to do with the joker and decided on a twisted ring to symbolize the Goddess of Chaos, who had fallen in love with the God of Darkness despite being taboo, and spurred the God of Life's jealousy to turn him into a stalker.\n\n\n \"Okay, perfect. Now they really look like cards made in a temple.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, and they will be easy to understand since they also look like the karuta.\"\n\n\n Gil and I complimented each other on the letter designs, but Lutz looked at the board with a frown.\n\n\n \"Myne, you really have to make stencils to print them. There's no way this will all match if we try to stamp it.\"\n\n\n \"…That's right. I'll make the template.\"\n\n\n I made a stencil out of thick paper - a process I was now very used to - so I could print the ink directly onto the board. After all, I had more than enough time, and making stencils for something as simple as playing cards was very easy.\n\n\n \"All right, Myne. I have to go home now.\"\n\n\n I didn't want Lutz to leave, but I couldn't exactly ask him to stay the night.\n\n\n \"Okay…\" I nodded sadly, and Lutz pinched my cheeks with a worried smile. I covered my cheek and glared at him.\n\n\n \"… Don't look so sad. I'll be back tomorrow with Tuuli.\"\n\n\n \"You better, unless you want me to die of loneliness.\"\n\n\n After dismissing Lutz, Gil looked at me with concern.\n\n\n \"Are you lonely, Sister Myne?\"\n\n\n \"UH Huh. I'm so used to living with my family that I really miss them already.\"\n\n\n I knew staying at the temple was safer for me, but I wanted to go home. It had been my choice to come here and yet I felt like I had been abandoned.\n\n\n \"Do you want to hug me like you hugged Lutz?\", Gil asked, trying to help. But before I could answer, I heard a loud \"Absolutely not!\" from behind me.\n\n\n I turned around surprised to see Fran standing there, with a terrified expression on his face. He walked over to Gil and chastised him in a low voice.\n\n\n \"Gil, Sister Myne is your master. Consoling her is not the place of an assistant. Lutz is a friend whom she considers family, you are not in the same position as he is.\"\n\n\n \"… I know.\" Gil nodded his head, his teeth clenched in frustration.\n\n\n Seeing that, Fran's expression softened a little. Then he knelt down in front of me to look directly into my eyes, his expression hardening once again.\n\n\n \"Sister Myne. I understand that your extreme circumstances have left you feeling uncomfortable. Out of concern for you, I will overlook Lutz and your family comforting you. However, I request that you keep the proper distance between you and your attendants.\"\n\n\n He gave me a strict reminder not to be too friendly with my assistants, and I couldn't help but look at where Lutz had been a few moments ago. He was already gone, and a cold wind was blowing from the empty doorway. It hurt as it brushed against my cheeks, but I was more worried about how lonely winter would be than how cold it would be."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Three days after I started living in the temple, a letter arrived from the Head Priest asking if the ceremonial robes ordered from the Gilberta Company were ready yet. Disappointed that he had not written to set up a meeting, I had Rosina call Lutz. He arrived fast since he was in the workshop teaching the orphanage children how to do their winter work.\n\n\n \"Did something happen, Myne?\"\n\n\n \"The Head Priest sent me a letter asking when the ceremonial robes will be ready. I'm sorry, but could you ask Benno about them when you stop by the store for lunch?\"\n\n\n And so he did, returning with the reply that it would take three days to finish at the absolute minimum. To give them a little leeway, I sent a reply to the Head Priest saying that the robes would take five days to finish if they went all out. Hopefully, that will keep him from rushing them too much.\n\n\n When Fran brought me the reply from the Head Priest, he also brought with him a summoning letter for Benno. I gave this to Lutz when he visited my quarters to say goodbye and give me an update on the workshop.\n\n\n \"It looks like he'll be calling Lord Karstedt in seven days from now, and he wants Benno to deliver the finished robes at that time,\" I said, clinging to him the whole time.\n\n\n \"Fine. I'll give it to him on the way home. But you know, Myne… You haven't improved at all, are you all right?\"\n\n\n \"Not really. I want to get home at least once before the snow falls.\"\n\n\n Far from getting used to the loneliness, my homesickness was getting worse. It was also quite clear as I gradually spent more and more time clinging to Lutz and Tuuli whenever they came to my room. And Mom definitely couldn't visit because her pregnancy wasn't helping either.\n\n\n \"You know I won't be able to visit every day once the snow starts, right?\", Lutz said with a sigh as he gently stroked my head.\n\n\n Dad was busy enough with his afternoon shifts that he could only visit me once a week, while Tuuli could only visit me every other day. I would feel even lonelier when Lutz stopped visiting me every day to keep an eye on the workshop and his winter work.\n\n\n \"I wish the snow simply didn't exist.\" My arms around Lutz tightened at the thought of how cold it was, cold enough that snow would start falling at any moment.\n\n\n On the day of the meeting, the snow started falling just before the third bell. It wasn't enough for the snow to settle, but everyone knew that winter had truly begun.\n\n\n \"Do you think it will settle?\"\n\n\n \"Not yet, Sister Myne. There will be nothing to disrupt your meeting,\" Rosina assured her.\n\n\n After finishing harspiel practice, I was instructed on how to properly greet Karstedt. Rosina had been forcing me to repeat a beautiful bow over and over again.\n\n\n The road to elegance is not an easy one…\n\n\n \"Sister Myne, Benno will arrive this afternoon. There is not much time left to practice.\"\n\n\n Today's meeting was scheduled for the fifth bell. Benno would come to see me in my rooms beforehand, on the pretext of thanking me for giving him a connection to an archnoble. In the meantime, I had to learn a respectable enough greeting not to embarrass myself in front of Karstedt. And so, I put everything into practice.\n\n\n \"Hello Benno, Mark. Oh? Where's Lutz?\"\n\n\n Benno and Mark came into my room, the former wearing winter clothes with long sleeves in the style of the nobles and the latter carrying a box. I pursed my lips in a pout, waiting for Lutz to come with them.\n\n\n \"It started snowing, so I'm having Lutz prioritize his work in Myne's workshop. He should arrive with the finished work soon - one copy of each. Be sure to bring them to the meeting.\"\n\n\n \"The winter games? But why?\" I tilted my head in confusion, not understanding why Benno would want me to bring toys to a meeting with the Head Priest and an archnoble.\n\n\n \"My gut tells me those things are going to cause quite a stir. I figure now is a good time to hear what the Head Priest and an archnoble think about them before bringing them out to the public.\"\n\n\n \"Hmm, assuming there's never been anything like that before, I think they'll have a really big impact.\" I replied after thinking about how the cards and reversi had impacted the Earth, and Benno glared at me with distaste.\n\n\n \"… A really big impact? You threw away the paper and print without considering the consequences, and yet you're warning me about how important some toys will be?\"\n\n\n \"Well, to be clear, I know that paper and print are important enough to change the course of history. But my main reason for making them was because I needed them.\"\n\n\n It was hard not to know what a huge impact printing had on past civilizations and culture in general. And yet, for me, they were just the necessary steps I had to take to get my books.\n\n\n \"What's the matter, Benno? You look a little sick.\"\n\n\n \"I am. From you. We are going talk to the Head Priest and an archnoble, you know?\"\n\n\n Benno also has a sensitive side, I thought as Benno leaned over with a hand on his stomach. I had always thought of him as a tough guy who loved to pick a fight with someone, so it was a little strange to see him so nervous.\n\n\n \"Why are you so nervous, Benno? You've never had a problem standing up to the guild master and all the vested interests. These two are really good people. You'll be fine.\"\n\n\n \"Don't put the guild master on the same level as an arch noble! Whose fault do you think this is all about!\" shouted Benno before collapsing onto the table and pressing his forehead against it.\n\n\n A lock of his hair, previously combed back with what was probably some kind of hair gel, fell onto the table.\n\n\n \"Master Benno, please don't hit your head against the table. Your hair is getting mussed.\" Mark pointed out with an amused smile.\n\n\n Benno hatefully combed the hair back into place before looking at me with his dark red eyes. \"…Bah. It's times like this - and only times like this - that I really wish you could give me some of your wonderful ignorance.\"\n\n\n \"What? But you're just handing out some robes, aren't you? I remember how happy you were to have a connection to an archnoble.\"\n\n\n \"You idiot! Use your head and think! In what world would I be summoned to the temple to deliver an order? I'm going to get drilled for all the information I have on you,\" Benno said with a withering look, forcing me to point at me in surprise.\n\n\n \"Um, me? What exactly would they want to learn about me?\"\n\n\n \"I can expect us to share all the information we dug up on the head of the Ink Guild, and then we'll talk about what to do with you. I have information from the lower city, the arch noble has information from the Nobles district, and the Head Priest wants to know everything we do.\"\n\n\n Speaking of which, the Head Priest had also talked about gathering information. And that I should stay inside my room until he was done with it. I guess this meeting meant he was done.\n\n\n \"Benno, has anything else happened with the head of the Ink Guild?\"\n\n\n \"No, nothing yet. The colder it gets, strange people hanging around outside a store stand out more. Either they don't want to push things, or they've already found out what they wanted to know and are waiting for the winter social season to find out more.\"\n\n\n While the city was snowbound, the nobles who had traveled to the farming towns during the Harvest Festival would return to the nobles district. The archduke would stay in the sovereignty - the central region that occupied the highest position among the regions ruled by the dukes, known as duchies - from spring through summer, but the main time for the nobles to socialize was winter. That's where they gathered to exchange information with archdukes from other duchies and strengthen old ties.\n\n\n \"Sister Myne. Master Benno It's about time.\"\n\n\n \"Thank you, Fran. Then let us depart.\"\n\n\n I nodded to Benno and had Fran hold up the finished sets of games from the winter work Lutz had brought. After double checking Mark's box containing the robes, we left my quarters. The hallways to the Head Priest's room were cold and unrelenting. So cold that I really didn't want to leave my room at all.\n\n\n When we arrived, Fran rang the doorbell and watched the door open. Karstedt had already arrived, and I could see him gracefully sipping tea at the guest table.\n\n\n \"Head priest. Lord Karstedt. I am glad the gods ordained that we meet again. For me, this is an auspicious day blessed by the warmth of Geduldh, the Earth Goddess, and I pray you feel the same.\"\n\n\n I had only seen Karstedt dressed in full armor, but now he wore the fine clothes of nobility. His auburn hair was combed back with the same kind of gel as Benno's, and I could see at a glance that he had a sort of broad forehead.\n\n\n His silky velvet shirt had long, dropped sleeves that I expected from nobles, and I could see that they were made of layers of various fabrics with elegant lace holding them together.\n\n\n His back was broad and his body visibly muscular thanks to his training, making him a hard presence to ignore. But his fierce aura seemed gentler now than when he had been wearing his armor, and his light blue eyes seemed a bit softer today.\n\n\n \"It is good to see you well, Myne, the shrine maiden apprentice.\"\n\n\n \"I bless you from the bottom of my heart, Lord Karstedt.\" I finished my greeting without messing anything, and Benno introduced himself in turn.\n\n\n We then sat in the seats offered to us by the Head Priest, with our servants standing behind us. The Head Priest was seated at one end of the table with Karstedt on his left, me on his right, and Benno at the other end.\n\n\n \"Thank you all for coming,\" said the Head Priest. \"First, we will look at the ceremonial robes.\"\n\n\n Mark stepped forward and handed the wooden box to Benno, who opened it and held it out to Karstedt. The inside was lined with a cloth that enveloped the ceremonial robes, which were as deep as the blue of the ocean. Their wavy embroidery shimmered under the light of several candles that illuminated the otherwise dim room.\n\n\n \"These are Sister Myne's ceremonial robes.\"\n\n\n Karstedt looked at them and then asked me if they were what I had ordered. I nodded and confirmed that they were, as I had seen the finished product and was ready for them.\n\n\n \"In that case, I present the robes to you, Sister Myne.\"\n\n\n \"I will be eternally grateful.\"\n\n\n I took the robes, and once I had them, Karstedt stuck out his chin to point at something. It was then that I realized for the first time that the person behind him was not his attendant, but was Damuel, the knight from earlier, perhaps serving as Karstedt's squire. He handed Benno a bag with gold inside.\n\n\n After checking the contents, Benno handed the bag to Mark.\n\n\n \"Benno, I was told you worked extremely fast to complete this order. You have done well. Karstedt. Damuel Your prayers have already been fulfilled.\" At the Head Priest's words, everyone - Benno, of course, but also Karstedt and Damuel as well - let out sighs of relief.\n\n\n I asked Fran to take care of the box containing my robe. He nodded and took it off the table.\n\n\n \"Attendants, step back,\" the Head Priest ordered as he placed a magic tool to avoid eavesdropping. It was a wide-ranging tool that affected a wider area rather than just individuals, as Benno lacked mana and could not power a tool of his own. The Head Priest placed four magical stones around us, then chanted something that sent a wall of faint blue light bursting from the tool and enveloped us in a cube.\n\n\n I could see the attendants standing behind the wall of light, but I couldn't hear anything behind it. It was easy to guess that they couldn't hear anything from this side either.\n\n\n Surely there's a magic tool for everything, I thought as Benno shivered beside me. I had gotten pretty used to seeing this sort of thing, but for people in the lower city, almost anything magical was cause for surprise. That said, Benno didn't own a big store for nothing. All he did was shudder, without shouting or looking around me as he would have done in the past.\n\n\n \"Now then, Benno. We have a lot to discuss.\"\n\n\n Benno crossed his arms in front of his chest.\n\n\n \"… My knowledge is yours.\"\n\n\n \"I heard that the Ink Guild began investigating Myne immediately after signing a magical contract with them, with Lutz being their first target. Is that correct?\"\n\n\n \"Yes. In general, information is gathered before a contract is signed to influence the proceedings as favorably as possible,\" Benno explained. \"I can't imagine why they would start gathering information after the contract is signed.\"\n\n\n The Head priest nodded and looked at me.\n\n\n \"Have you met the head of the Ink Guild before, Myne?\"\n\n\n \"No. Benno hid me while the contract was being negotiated, so I know neither his name nor his face.\"\n\n\n \"The head of the Ink Guild has deep connections with the nobles,\" Benno began, \"and not much is said about him. I decided that minimizing Sister Myne's contact with him would be ideal, and had her wait in another room while he visited.\"\n\n\n He explained why he hadn't let me meet the head of the Ink Guild, which caused the Head Priest to let out a laugh with a faint smile of approval.\n\n\n \"You are a wise man, Benno. I applaud your decision. The man you're talking about is Wolf, isn't it?\"\n\n\n \"What rumors have you heard, what led you to conclude that he would harm the shrine maiden apprentice?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest and Karstedt asked Benno a series of questions. I knew nothing about the head of the Ink Guild and therefore had no choice but to remain silent.\n\n\n \"Wolf is the head of the Ink Guild, yes. I have heard that he is willing to engage in criminal acts to strengthen his relations with the nobles, but I don't know if these rumors are true, so forgive my lack of details.\"\n\n\n Karstedt, frowning, rubbed his chin.\n\n\n \"In that case, I would assume he started gathering information so blatantly because the contract has been signed, so you no longer care if your relationship is affected.\"\n\n\n The suggestion made Benno's eyes go wide. It wasn't easy to void a magical contract, which required significant preparation before signing one. But to think of it another way, that also meant that it didn't matter how overtly antagonistic the Ink Guild was now that it was signed. After all, even if they escalated things to the point of harming me, the contract could not be voided without the consent of all parties involved.\n\n\n Karstedt guessed that Ink Guild had exploited that, and for a second I saw an extremely bitter grimace on Benno's face.\n\n\n \"Benno, what do you think Wolf will benefit from gathering information about Myne? I would like to hear your perspective as a merchant and as one who lives in the lower city?\" the Head Priest asked.\n\n\n Benno chose his words carefully.\n\n\n \"To us merchants, Sister Myne's value is her knowledge of seemingly infinite commodities, though few know how much she is really worth. If Wolf were one of those few, he would no doubt try to bring her to the Ink Guild. But Sister Myne has already joined the Merchants Guild and the Gilberta company. In that case, he probably intends to rely on money to gather as much knowledge as he can, kidnap her to extract her knowledge, or take her loved ones as his hostage to blackmail her.\"\n\n\n Karstedt looked at me doubtfully. No doubt he thought it was impossible for a girl as young as me to have such valuable knowledge.\n\n\n \"However, I don't think he would be able to learn everything she knows, even through kidnapping and blackmail,\" Benno continued. \"To maximize the amount he gained from her, he would need to keep her locked in an isolated location for long periods of time, which would be extremely strenuous.\"\n\n\n I shuddered at the thought of that becoming a reality, not having considered the possibility of someone kidnapping me and imprisoning me for my knowledge. I finally understood how well Benno had been treating me, and the thought of what might have happened if I had met someone else sent more chills down my spine.\n\n\n \"Why would keeping her locked up be strenuous?\" asked Karstedt casually. \"It should be simple as long as the kidnappers have a spare room or a country mansion. Surely the kidnapping itself would be more of a challenge.\"\n\n\n The fact that he was talking about confining people with so much knowledge scared me.\n\n\n \"If her abductor is not fully aware of Sister Myne's poor health, she will die under his care in a matter of days. In Sister Myne's case, the confinement will be more grueling than the kidnapping.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, I must agree. She spent days in bed with the disease after only half a day in the repentance chamber. If treated as a standard prisoner, she would die before she could teach them anything of value.\" The Head Priest agreed with Benno on the spot; it seemed that the chamber of repentance incident had really stuck with him.\n\n\n However, I wished he would forget about it. I get fevers like that all the time. It was no one's fault. Also, while I was at it, I wished he would forget that I was the only blue shrine maiden who was ever put in the repentance chamber.\n\n\n \"It is likely, then, that Wolf plans to sell her to the nobles after he learns what he can from her,\" Karstedt concluded.\n\n\n Benno frowned in confusion.\n\n\n \"… I know Sister Myne suffers from the Devourer, but is there any other reason the nobles would want her?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest exchanged a glance with Karstedt, then nodded to Benno.\n\n\n \"I don't intend to fill you in on all the details, but yes, there is another reason. As mentioned, Wolf most likely intends to sell Myne to nobles after getting his hands on her. But it is also possible that a nobleman has ordered Wolf to kidnap her so that they can arrange a ransom and indebt her to them. Once they rescue her, they might even claim that she was their daughter all along. It's also possible that a broader quest for revenge plays a role in this, which means the threat of murder must be considered.\"\n\n\n Gaaah! I can already hear Benno demanding to know what I've done! I can already hear the screams! Not the rumbling, but the thunder!\n\n\n Before the Head Priest listed all the possibilities one by one, I thought the Ink Guild's quest to seek information about me was a bit disgusting and nothing more. It hadn't even occurred to me that I was in that much danger. Now I could understand why the Head Priest had ordered me to stay in my quarters.\n\n\n \"Benno,\" the Head Priest began, \"you will continue to withhold information from her business associates. Myne will not leave the temple during the winter. When she leaves her room it will only be to perform rituals or visit the orphanage. With gray priests accompanying her, she should be safe. Our real problems begin in the spring.\"\n\n\n His words earned him the approval of Benno and Karstedt.\n\n\n \"Because they will also gather information and allies during the winter,\" Benno explained.\n\n\n \"We must think of a plan at once. Benno, what means are there to control this?\" said the Head Priest, referring to me.\n\n\n Everyone looked in my direction.\n\n\n Finally, Benno shook his head slowly with an exhausted expression.\n\n\n \"I don't know. She can scale something to a ridiculous degree in a matter of minutes, and if you take your eyes off her, she could be at death's door by the end of the hour. If I knew a way to keep it under control, I'd be using it by now.\"\n\n\n \"As expected. I suppose keeping her within arm's reach is all one can do.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest and Benno looked at me and gave loud sighs in unison. Then they looked at each other with wry smiles. They seemed to have bonded.\n\n\n \"Myne, you cause trouble every time you do something. From now on, you will get my and Benno's permission before you take a new course of action or develop a new product,\" the HeadPriest said, reminding me of the orphanage's winter games.\n\n\n Benno's insight had saved me once again. I picked up the winter work package Fran had left for me on the floor.\n\n\n \"… I imagine you'll want to see them, then. It's the winter work the orphanage has to do.\"\n\n\n \"Ah, I remember you mentioning something like that. Show me.\"\n\n\n I pulled out the set of cards, the reversi and the fake chess set, lining them up side by side along the table. Benno leaned over to look at them as well, because although he had heard me explain each of them, he had never seen them.\n\n\n \"What are these?\"\n\n\n \"Those are playing cards. There are many games you can play with them, but I intend to start by teaching the children at the orphanage to play a game called Memory. You shuffle the cards and then lay them on the table with the art side down. Then you flip over two cards, and if they are both the same number, you keep them. Whoever has the most cards at the end of the game wins.\"\n\n\n It was difficult for the younger children to hold a hand full of wooden cards in their small hands, so concentration was the only game I was planning to show them for the time being.\n\n\n The rules intrigued Karstedt, so we began to play, using only half the deck to save time. Suffice it to say that the Head Priest with his excellent memory completely crushed us.\n\n\n \"As I said, there are many games you can play with them. They'll be easier to use once we've worked out a formula for harder paper and can get them out of that instead of wood.\"\n\n\n I taught them about blackjack, poker, and hearts, among other games, and it seemed that Karstedt was quite pleased with the cards in general.\n\n\n \"We have divination cards that are activated using mana, but there are no cards made for fun. And, overall, it's nice that you can play so many games with just one deck of cards. No doubt these will become very popular among nobles.\"\n\n\n \"They are also good for learning numbers. I made them so that the children at the orphanage can learn to do math,\" I explained.\n\n\n The Head Priest nodded before pointing to the reversi board.\n\n\n \"What about this, then?\"\n\n\n \"This is reversi. You place the stones in the boxes, and when the stones of one color get stuck between the stones of the other, they change color. Whoever has the most stones of his color at the end wins.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest seemed the most interested in reversi. We began to play, me as his opponent, and I explained the rules as we went along. Tiles were laid out, tiles were flipped, and after all the squares were filled, the board was covered in white. I had won.\n\n\n \"…Did I lose?\"\n\n\n \"It's hard to win right after learning the rules. I'm sure you'll start beating me after we play a few more games.\" I shrugged as the Head Priest stared at the board in a daze.\n\n\n I had beaten the Head Priest since playing reversi for the first time and didn't know any of the strategies, but he was smart enough to figure them out on his own in no time. I had done everything possible to him specifically because I knew this was my only chance to beat him.\n\n\n \"Then we'll play again. This time I'll win.\"\n\n\n \"Head Priest, let's save the rematch for next time. We'll play again if you buy the game.\"\n\n\n \"Very well. Consider it bought.\"\n\n\n Benno's shoulders shook a little after seeing the Head Priest buy it instantly. He gave me a subtle nod of good work under the table.\n\n\n \"Ahem! And finally, what are these?\"\n\n\n \"Um, these are (chess) pieces. They are played on the same board as reversi. Each type of piece moves in a different way, and you win by moving one of your pieces to your opponent's king.\"\n\n\n I cleaned up the reversi stones and explained how each chess piece moved while Karstedt stared at the board with narrowed, contemplative eyes.\n\n\n \"… This looks like gewinnen.\"\n\n\n \"Oh, so there is another game like this, should I make some changes so they are not so similar?\"\n\n\n I understood that even on Earth, board games had existed for a long time. It was only natural that this world would have something similar.\n\n\n \"There is no need. It's a game played among nobles and requires mana. The goal is to take territory and the fighting strategies are completely different. This game will work well in the lower city, I imagine.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think they'll sell much if the nobles don't buy them…\"\n\n\n There weren't many people in the lower city wealthy enough to spend money on something that was purely for entertainment; almost everyone had their hands full keeping their families alive. My safest bet would be to combine chess with reversi and market it as an alternative way to play gewinnen.\n\n\n With our discussion of winter work over, the Head Priest under the soundproof barrier. He and Karstedt summoned their assistants, who bought the reversi and the cards respectively.\n\n\n I sold them for four large silvers - a premiere price since we were not planning to sell them until the spring started. Considering that I anticipated their market price would start at around five to seven small silvers, we scammed them a bit.\n\n\n \"Our partnership continues to be fruitful, Benno; I approve. May you be blessed with the divine protection of Geduldh, the Earth Goddess.\"\n\n\n \"I thank you for your time, honorable Head Priest. If you will excuse me, I will leave now. It has been a pleasure, Lord Karstedt. Sister Myne.\" Benno crossed his arms in front of his chest and walked out, Mark did the same behind him before following suit.\n\n\n After watching them depart, I looked at the Head Priest.\n\n\n \"In that case, I think I'll be leaving as well. It's been a-\"\n\n\n \"We have more to discuss with you. Take this.\"\n\n\n He placed four of the magical sound-blocking tools on the table. The Head Priest, Karstedt and I took one, and Damuel took the remaining one."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Benno left the room and Damuel went to the now empty seat. I stood up, thinking that, as a commoner, I should sit at the foot of the table, but the Head Priest stopped me.\n\n\n \"Stay seated where you are, Myne.\"\n\n\n \"What? But…\"\n\n\n I looked at Damuel but he just looked at me, the corners of his gray eyes crinkled into a quiet smile as he sat down. It would have been a bit much for me to force him out of his seat so I could sit there, so I just sat where I was.\n\n\n Once everyone was in their seats, the Head Priest looked around at everyone assembled.\n\n\n \"Now then, Myne. I will explain to you what punishments the Archduke decreed after being informed of the incident during the trombe extermination.\"\n\n\n \"The punishments?\"\n\n\n I had expected Shikza to be punished, but I didn't want to know what that punishment would be. All I wanted was to never see him again. And as if sensing that, the Head Priest lowered his eyes.\n\n\n \"… It is not hard to imagine that this is not information you wish to know, and I myself hesitate to inform you about the affairs of the nobility. But this information will be essential in preparing you for your future.\" He let out a sigh, then looked at Karstedt and Damuel before dryly continuing his explanation.\n\n\n \"The archduke was extremely displeased that a knight assigned to protect the shrine maiden apprentice not only hurt her, but made extermination more difficult. First, he ordered Karstedt to be stricter in his training of the newcomers, and docked his salary for three months. He also ordered him to provide a quarter of the funds for their new tunics.\"\n\n\n \"Now, as for Shikza… A knight who refuses to listen to orders in battle would only bring harm to his comrades, and by attacking the target he had been assigned to protect he had disgraced himself as a knight. The archduke had determined that a soldier of the Knightly Order who disobeyed orders and abandoned his duty was worthy of severe punishment.\"\n\n\n \"Thus, the archduke decreed that Shikza should be executed. Under normal circumstances, his entire family would be punished along with him, but since that would probably only generate more anger for him, Myne, the archduke gave Shikza's father two options: he could either allow his family to be punished or sign a contract to never deal with you again and pay a hefty fee. If he signed the contract and paid the fee, his family would be spared punishment, and Shikza would be recorded as having died an honorable death in battle.\"\n\n\n I swallowed hard. Not for a second had I expected that the archduke would have executed Shikza. Considering that Shikza was a nobleman and I was a commoner, I thought that at worst he would receive a light punishment.\n\n\n \"Shikza's father paid the fee and swore not to get involved with you - Said fee was to pay half the cost of his robe. And so, it was written that Shikza died honorably in battle while serving the Knight Order.\"\n\n\n Then I realized that the execution had already happened. I looked at Damuel reflectively, knowing that him sitting there meant he had avoided execution. But perhaps he had been given some other severe punishment.\n\n\n The Head Priest also looked at Damuel, probably noticing my glance.\n\n\n \"Damuel paid a quarter of the cost of your robe and was demoted to the rank of apprentice for a year. His sentence was lightened solely due to your defense of him.\"\n\n\n \"My defense?\"\n\n\n I couldn't remember defending him, especially in any official setting. I tilted my head to one side in confusion, and Damuel's lips curved as he let out a friendly chuckle.\n\n\n \"You defended me in front of Lord Ferdinand, remember? You said I was kind to you, I warned Shikza and tried to help you. If you hadn't, I would have been punished just as harshly as Shikza.\"\n\n\n It seemed that, under normal circumstances, he would have been executed anyway for failing to protect me. But my word had provided evidence that Damuel had tried to stop him, but could do nothing because he was of a lower status than Shikza, which lessened his sentence. He had been demoted back to the rank of apprentice despite having come of age, but considering that the alternative was to be executed alongside Shikza, that was nothing at all.\n\n\n \"My family is at the bottom of the barrel, even among the laynobles, all my life I've been run over by people of higher status than me. Hardly anyone has stuck their neck out and helped me before. It's hard to describe how happy I was when I learned that you had asked Lord Ferdinand to lighten my sentence.\"\n\n\n I had a feeling he was exaggerating the importance of what I had done, but judging by how unfair his upbringing seemed to be, I could guess that even laynobles had problems despite being nobles.\n\n\n The head priest spoke up.\n\n\n \"Also, Damuel has been assigned to be your bodyguard during his year as an apprentice.\"\n\n\n \"What, bodyguard?!\"\n\n\n \"You really are in significant danger,\" the Head Priest said, looking at me with his golden eyes before turning back to Karstedt. \"But you have no sense of self-preservation, so we'll have to explain.\"\n\n\n Karstedt met his gaze and nodded slowly before looking me in the eye. His light blue eyes that had looked a little softer only moments before hardened once more.\n\n\n \"Now all of the archinobles know that there is an apprentice shrine maiden with enough value to be exploited,\" Karstedt began. \"You were given blue robes despite your low status level, you accompanied the Knight Order and completed your duty with a huge display of mana that everyone in the Order saw. The fact that the Archduke himself allowed you to wear blue robes has only added weight to the rumors of your worth.\"\n\n\n The Order of Knights was a gathering of nobles; if despising me as a commoner and treating me as such would bring disgrace to their houses as it did to Shikza's, then they had to approach it from another angle. Apparently, it was natural for the nobles to immediately consider ways they could exploit me once they found out what the Head Priest had said and how much mana I had.\n\n\n \"You are a commoner with devourer that no one has signed a contract with, but everyone knows you are in Lord Ferdinand's custody. We believe that a significant number of nobles will begin to curry favor with Lord Ferdinand and the Archduke as they approach you on seemingly friendly terms so that they may one day exploit you.\"\n\n\n If we assume that Wolf, the head of the Ink Guild, was connected to these nobles, then Karstedt had an idea of what might be going on.\n\n\n \"A noble who wanted to exploit you could have Wolf kidnap you so they could then rescue you, putting you in a debt of gratitude to them. When dealing with nobles, one must always assume that they are trying to take advantage of others, and if you take this into account, your life should not be at risk barring extenuating circumstances. But no such assurances can be made for your family and friends…\"\n\n\n The Head Priest continued for him.\n\n\n \"For example, it is possible for those working alongside Wolf to have you kidnapped, then sell you to the archduke of an opposing duchy, who will then claim you were his daughter all along. In that case, your real family would be nothing more than an obstacle, a reminder of the truth. Therefore, they would be silenced - one way or another.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest's prediction was so grim that I gasped. The very thought of putting my family in danger sent a shiver down my spine. I clenched my fists tightly in my lap, but I couldn't stop them from shaking.\n\n\n And on top of it all, Damuel explained to me from his perspective as a laynoble how the nobles thought of me.\n\n\n \"Most laynobles are still full of disdain and contempt for you. They don't want to accept that a commoner has so much mana. And honestly, I would have found it hard to believe that a commoner with devourer could have so much mana if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.\"\n\n\n It seemed the laynobles were more concerned with hating me, out of envy than exploiting me.\n\n\n \"But no laynoble would oppose Lord Ferdinand head-on,\" Damuel continued, glancing nervously at Karstedt and the Head Priest. \"If they do anything, it will be through archnobles. And in my opinion, I think you're most at risk from people who have more personal reasons to hate you.\"\n\n\n \"Shikza's father is more concerned about the continuation of his household than anything else, but his mother is not,\" Karstedt said. \"They had been forced to give Shikza to the temple due to circumstances and her small amount of mana, and she was very happy when he finally returned home thanks to the Sovereignty purge. I heard that she… that she hates you with all her heart, Sister Myne.\"\n\n\n I shuddered. From my own experience, I could well sympathize with the fury one feels at losing a family member. I couldn't even imagine how furious I would be at someone who had hurt my own family. And right now, that fury was directed at me. I could live with that if that rage ended with me, but I was terrified that it was directed at my friends and family.\n\n\n \"… Dangerous nobles, who might attempt murder. Are there nobles foolish enough to tear down their house out of spite?\" the Head Priest asked. I clenched my fists in my lap, waiting for Damuel's answer.\n\n\n With a sad expression, he whispered, \"I don't know. If Shikza's mother really harms Sister Myne, her house will be done for sure. But a woman's anger knows no bounds, and I don't know what it will lead her to do. I cannot know.\"\n\n\n Karstedt's brows sank into a deep frown.\n\n\n \"If she is willing to destroy her house to satisfy her lust for revenge, the situation may be worse than we thought.\"\n\n\n It seemed that nobles were generally restrained by the fear of ruining their house, the honor of their ancestors, and the life of their family.\n\n\n \"I never thought Wolf or Shikza's mother would be so dangerous,\" Damuel said.\n\n\n It turned out that Wolf regularly went to the Noble Quarter to sell ink. He was quite well known among the nobles, as they were the ones who bought and used ink the most. However, none of them knew that he was known in the lower city as a criminal who would do anything to strengthen his connections with the nobility.\n\n\n \"My plan had been to raise you here as an apprentice shrine maiden so that one day you could marry into a noble house, but now that plan will have to change,\" the Head Priest said.\n\n\n \"What?\"\n\n\n Is he saying he would have me marry into a nobleman? I don't think I'd agree to that; surely that's not something I've ever considered myself!\n\n\n I blinked in confusion, not understanding what the Head Priest was saying. I'd rather he didn't try to plan my life that way, especially when it comes to something as important as marriage. Just think what poor man would be forced to marry me for fear of going against the authority of the Head Priest. I would feel so bad for him.\n\n\n \"I wasn't planning to marry any nobleman.\"\n\n\n \"I believe I told you that regardless of whether you intended to sign with a noble, you would one day bear a noble's children. I thought about raising you here and giving you experience as a shrine maiden so that one might accept you as a wife, but the situation has changed.\"\n\n\n I certainly remembered him saying something like that when we were talking about Rosina becoming my attendant. It seemed that even then the Head Priest had already intended to play matchmaker for me. How much did this man like to give himself extra work?\n\n\n When I was surprised to feel a little astonishment at how serious the Head Priest was and how extreme his sense of responsibility was, he looked at Karstedt.\n\n\n \"Myne, it is also likely that you, your friends and family will be in danger if you are left alone. It is in everyone's best interest that you be adopted by a nobleman as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n Being adopted by a noble meant separating me from my family and living with nobles in the nobles' quarter.\n\n\n … Will I have to leave my family again?\n\n\n A tremor ran through my heart. Fear had built up inside me as I spent my time alone in the temple - fear that my ties to my family would weaken in their absence - and all that fear exploded at once.\n\n\n \"Karstedt will be able to protect you to some extent if he adopts you, and I can vouch for the strength of his character - will you, Karstedt?\"\n\n\n \"Anything for a friend, Lord Ferdinand.\"\n\n\n The conversation continued without me as I watched in a daze.\n\n\n Karstedt leaned forward to look at me more closely. He was an arch nobleman, his eyes crinkled warmly and his muscular body poised to protect me. Considering how much trust the Head Priest had in him, I could guess that I wouldn't find a better foster father anywhere else.\n\n\n \"Myne, will you become my foster daughter?\"\n\n\n \"No.\"\n\n\n I shot her act of goodwill with a single word. They all looked at me, their eyes wide with a mixture of surprise and disbelief.\n\n\n \"Sister Myne,\" Damuel began in panic, \"An adoption like this is better than anything you could wish for! Why would you refuse the kindness of Lord Ferdinand and Lord Karstedt!\"\n\n\n \"Calm yourself, Damuel. Myne, why do you refuse?\" The head priest's calm voice was tinged with anger. But still, I couldn't say yes.\n\n\n \"It's just not possible. Spending the whole winter alone in the temple is already breaking my heart; I can't accept leaving my family for the rest of my life. I just can't.\" I shook my head vigorously, and as I did so I could feel my mana pushing along with my inflamed emotions. It was pushing up from within myself. \"I want to go home, I don't want to leave my family anymore!\"\n\n\n \"Calm down, Myne!\" the Head Priest exclaimed as he rose with a noise from his chair, immediately pushing a clear thumb-sized gemstone against my forehead. The stone turned light yellow in just a few moments - an almost instantaneous change that made the Head Priest struggle.\n\n\n \"Karstedt, Damuel - do you have empty magic stones?\"\n\n\n \"Sir!\"\n\n\n Karstedt and Damuel hurriedly pulled out magic stones, which the Head Priest grabbed before picking me up and entering his hidden room.\n\n\n \"I'll take her to my workshop to minimize the damage!\"\n\n\n Upon entering the room, he sat down on the bench, placed me in front of him and then placed another magic stone on my forehead. Stone after stone changed color, and I could feel the mana churning inside me being absorbed.\n\n\n \"I know we're very close to the Ritual of Dedication, but still, you've let too much mana build up inside you. So silly.\"\n\n\n \"… That's because I've been trapped in my quarters lately and I'm not offering any mana.\"\n\n\n It felt like my emotions had been sucked out along with the mana. I wiped the tears from my eyes and let out a sigh. But still, despite all that, the heat that was trying to ravage inside me hadn't completely suffocated, and I lacked the energy to pushed it back into its box.\n\n\n \"I have to say, you seemed pretty mentally unstable there, did something happen? \"\n\n\n \"It's all your fault. If you hadn't dug into my memories…\"\n\n\n Thanks to the Head Priest's magical tool, I remembered with perfect clarity a world and a time I could never return to. I saw my old mother, talked to her, and ached for the family I had lost. I had been so busy here that I had done my best not to think of my former family, but he had dug up the memories and left a hole in my heart that would not heal.\n\n\n That's why I decided to do everything I could to make sure I didn't lose my new family, and why it had hurt me that immediately after making that decision, I had been forced to stay inside the temple. I was still overwhelmed by a sense of loss as I had not had time to heal by spending time with my family.\n\n\n \"… So that's the reason, then.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest looked away, his brow furrowed in regret. I realized that he hadn't used the magic tool because he wanted to, and that he had also been affected by the weight of my emotions while we were in sync. I cursed myself for my lack of tact.\n\n\n \"I'm sorry. You didn't deserve that,\" I said, squeezing the Head Priest's sleeve as he pressed another magical stone against my forehead. \"You had to do what you did to make sure I'm not a threat, and it's because of that that I'm still alive. I know you did the right thing.\"\n\n\n \"It's just that, when I think of the family I'll never see again, I remember how important my new family is to me… But I have to spend the whole winter here alone. It's so lonely I could die. And if you tell me now that I can never see them again, maybe I will…\"\n\n\n My heart began to ache as I confessed how I felt, and the tears welling up in my eyes made the Head Priest's face distort in front of me.\n\n\n \"Myne, restrain yourself!\"\n\n\n \"I'll never see my family again if a noble adopts me!\"\n\n\n I looked up at the Head Priest, blinking in surprise, and saw him grimacing as he looked down at me.\n\n\n \"A…hug like this will calm you down, correct?\"\n\n\n \"…Yes.\"\n\n\n Our positions were the reverse of what they had been after using the magic tool. Hearing the Head Priest struggle to say \"hug\" was kind of cute, and I let out a small chuckle. But it was a bit awkward for him to hug me while standing, so I sat on his lap and looked for a more comfortable position.\n\n\n \"… Myne, you seem to have calmed down already.\"\n\n\n \"Not yet.\"\n\n\n I couldn't hug the Head Priest like I could with Lutz or Tuuli; all I could do was lean against him as I sat on his thigh.\n\n\n \"This is perfect. Just keep squeezing me.\"\n\n\n \"I don't think this is perfect at all,\" he said with a frown, but he did as I asked without leaving me. His steady warmth and breathing calmed the storm in my heart.\n\n\n Only after seeing that he had calmed me enough did the Head Priest mutter an exasperated, \"What can be done with you?\" Then, like punishing a rebellious child, he explained to me why I had no choice but to be adopted by a nobleman\n\n\n \"Unlike a normal devourer child, you possess an enormous amount of mana. Too much to be ignored.\"\n\n\n \"…Do I really have that much mana?\"\n\n\n I figured I had more mana than most people because of the knights' reaction during the Healing Ritual, but I didn't think it was a \"huge\" amount.\n\n\n \"Myne!\" The Head Priest, his voice raised in panic, grabbed my arm and pulled me to him. I fell into his arms and was soon wrapped in his long, drooping sleeves.\n\n\n The Head Priest's expression tightened as he looked at me.\n\n\n \"It is too much mana for an average noble to contain, even after contracting with you. And it should be noted that your mana capacity will grow as you do. You will need to learn to control the mana within you and master the techniques necessary to put it to good use.\"\n\n\n Apparently, I would need to become the adopted daughter of a noble in order to go to the Royal Academy and learn about mana, about magic and ways to use it. A noble who signed with me would need to prepare me to use magical tools that used a literally enormous amount of mana so as not to put those around me at risk. But there were hardly any nobles in the city who had magic tools that could withstand my enormous amount of mana.\n\n\n \"Your mana is too much for a single noble to keep. It must be used for the good of the duchy. For the good of the country.\"\n\n\n \"…I'm not sure I understand.\"\n\n\n Ever since I found out I was sick with the Devourer, I was told that I would have to sign on with a noble to soothe the heat and survive. It was hard to believe that I had so much mana that even that wasn't an option for me. It didn't feel real. It felt like it was happening to someone else, not me.\n\n\n \"You need to face reality, Myne. You endanger the lives of everyone around you just by feeling emotional. If you don't learn to control your emotions, you're likely to hurt even your precious family someday.\"\n\n\n \"… T-That won't happen while I'm with them. The reason I got this way in the first place is because I miss them.\"\n\n\n The problem was staying separate from my family. As long as I was with them, I could live in peace.\n\n\n \"So please don't take me away from my family,\" I said.\n\n\n The Head Priest closed his eyes tightly, furrowing his eyebrows. It was clear from the expression on his face that he was suffering from a Myne-induced headache, which made me feel a little guilty. I knew I was asking the impossible from him, but I couldn't remain stable without my family. There was no help for that. My heart wanted what it wanted.\n\n\n \"… Ten years,\" the Head Priest muttered, seeming to have selected an age out of thin air.\n\n\n I looked at him in confusion, and the Head Priest shook his head in exasperation as he lowered me from his lap.\n\n\n \"The Royal Academy begins accepting students when they are ten years old. That's when you must leave. Until then, you can stay with your family, visiting the temple to offer your mana as you have been before. However,\" the Head Priest added, his expression hardening to show he was drawing a firm line, \"I will not listen to your protests after that. If you are determined to be a danger to others, you will be executed and your family along with you. None will be spared. Remember this well.\"\n\n\n \"…All right.\"\n\n\n It seemed that the Head Priest would not relent in having me adopted once I was ten years old. I put a hand on my chest as the weight of having limited time with my family hit me."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n I was finally allowed to walk around the temple as I wished, now that I had Damuel as a bodyguard. It was a bit hard for him, as he had to travel here from the Nobles' quarter every day, but he used the flying horse he made with his magic stone, so unlike Lutz and Tuuli, the snow posed no problem for him.\n\n\n Wow, magic sure is convenient.\n\n\n Thanks to Damuel, I was able to go back to the orphanage and bookroom, which provided a great distraction. My family couldn't visit me as much as before because of all the thick snow, but I could forget how much I missed them by absorbing myself in books. Only when I read could I forget my loneliness.\n\n\n The problem was that the library was incredibly cold. I couldn't stay for long no matter how much I bundled up, and neither Damuel nor Fran liked going there.\n\n\n \"Apprentice,\" Damuel said, \"could you ask Lord Ferdinand if you could bring the books back around to their rooms, so we don't have to stay in the book room?\"\n\n\n \"I agree with Sir Damuel's wisdom,\" said Fran, \"You'll end up sick if you go there too often.\"\n\n\n Damuel and Fran got along surprisingly well. They often seemed to agree on things, but perhaps Fran was used to dealing with nobles. Either way they were on good terms.\n\n\n \"…Head Priest. For the reasons stated, may I bring books from the book room to my rooms?\"\n\n\n \"You may borrow the books I brought myself. I wouldn't want you to fall ill just before the Dedication Ritual, after all… Hah. I win.\"\n\n\n The Head Priest let out a faint smile after hitting me in reversi. As I expected, his skill level was far superior to mine now that he understood the game. What kind of adult was he, going all out with a little girl? Sure, I only looked like a little girl, but still.\n\n\n \"I think it's cruel of you to get serious at a child, head priest.\"\n\n\n \"That's ridiculous coming from you, who went all out against a beginner. I see you're a sore loser, huh?\"\n\n\n The Head Priest was a bit immature at times, but he was a good person. He lent me his books, and when the loneliness got to be too much for me, he let me break into his room and exchange organizational papers or do a lot of math for precious cuddle time in the hidden room. He usually grimaced when I asked him, but I was too caught up in my own problems to worry about his. Our arrangement was fine with me.\n\n\n \"Good morning, Myne, how have you been?\" asked Tuuli.\n\n\n \"You don't sleep all day, do you?\", Lutz questioned.\n\n\n Tuuli and Lutz came to visit me on a day that was less snowy than usual.\n\n\n Tuuli was working on learning her letters. She brought the children's bible, as these were used as textbooks in the temple school, as well as her stone slate and a pen so she could study with the other children in the orphanage.\n\n\n Lutz knew how to read and write and mathematics, so he reviewed the winter work, taught the children along with the gray priests, and instructed Gil on how to write reports on the production of the workshop.\n\n\n \"Who are those two, apprentice?\"\n\n\n \"Sir Damuel, that's my big sister Tuuli and my friend Lutz. They come here a lot when it's not winter, so be sure to remember them.\"\n\n\n I introduced Damuel to Tuuli and Lutz. They looked at him open-mouthed.\n\n\n \"Tuuli. Lutz. This is Sir Damuel. He is serving as my bodyguard for now. I called him 'sir' because he's from the Knight Order.\"\n\n\n \"… The Order of Knights?! Woah, that's awesome!\"\n\n\n \"A noble is protecting you, Myne!\"\n\n\n They both looked at Damuel, sparkling with excitement and envy, which shook him a little.\n\n\n \"Apprentice, what should I do at times like this?\"\n\n\n \"Just smile, I guess.\"\n\n\n Damuel forced a stiff smile on his face, dealing with Tuuli and Lutz as best he could.\n\n\n I heard later that Damuel, who had rarely left the Quarter of Nobles where he was raised, had barely interacted with commoners before. And although he had an older brother, he had no younger siblings and was therefore unsure how to deal with young children. On top of all that, his family had such a low status within noble society that no one had ever looked at him with envy before.\n\n\n \"It's all right, Myne. I have to go to the orphanage with Lutz,\" Tuuli said, patting my arms around her.\n\n\n I just shook my head, squeezing tighter.\n\n\n \"I'll go with you today. The High Priest said I can walk around the temple now since Sir Damuel is with me, and I've been wondering how the temple school is going.\"\n\n\n I had been stuck in my rooms even when Lutz and Tuuli came to see me, but now I could go to the orphanage with them. And so I did, heading for the orphanage dining room with Rosina and Damuel in tow.\n\n\n \"An apprentice shrine maiden is serving as the orphanage director? There really is a labor shortage here…\"\n\n\n \"Yes, there simply aren't enough blue priests. The High Priest has enough on his hands, and I took on this role in hopes of helping him. Although I'm really only the director in name only.\"\n\n\n There was no need for me to explain that I had stuck my nose into temple affairs uninvited and ended up in the role after sticking my head. What mattered was that when something important happened at the orphanage, it was the High Priest who signed it. At best, I was just a bureaucratic go-between who managed the day-to-day affairs of the orphanage.\n\n\n \"You must be very talented if you are helping Lord Ferdinand with his work,\" Damuel sighed. He told me that when the High Priest had been in the Knightly Order, he was hard on those who lacked talent, giving extra work to those who lagged behind the others and ultimately cutting anyone who couldn't keep up. Some people even came to think of him as a monster.\n\n\n Considering how those in the temple assigned to be his assistants became first class in their jobs or were fired, it seemed that his intense method of training still continued today.\n\n\n \"But I've heard from Fran that the High Priest only sets a job that he thinks the person would be capable of, albeit with a little perseverance.\"\n\n\n \"Being able to pursue that job is proof that you have talent. He's never given me work to do before. I don't think he knew I existed, as I was just a laynoble apprentice.\"\n\n\n Damuel mumbled about how he wished the High Priest would give him work too, so I decided to ask the High Priest to do it the next time I saw him. I was sure he would love to give someone work to do.\n\n\n \"Welcome, Lutz, Tuuli. Oh, and to Rosina. I see Sister Myne is with you.\" Wilma greeted us with a smile, but then froze where she saw Damuel. She looked at me with teary eyes, trembling a little. \"Sister Myne, who could this well-dressed gentleman be?\"\n\n\n \"This is the gentleman who serves as my bodyguard. He's very kind and serious about his job, and he won't mistreat the women or children here. Right, Sir Damuel?\"\n\n\n \"Of course. I swear as a knight that I mean no harm or ill will to anyone here.\"\n\n\n Wilma had only experience with cruel blue priests and obnoxious nobles who came to the orphanage in search of flowers, so she remained on guard against Damuel as he invited us in.\n\n\n \"It's quite warm in here,\" Damuel commented, wide-eyed with surprise.\n\n\n Thanks to our efforts during the winter preparations, the oven in the dining room was burning brightly, heating the entire room. And everyone in the orphanage spent their days in the dining room, and the children's building remained empty to save as much firewood as possible. That meant more people in one place, which naturally heated the room even more.\n\n\n \"We thoroughly prepared the orphanage for winter,\" I explained. \"This is the best place for all of them.\"\n\n\n A temple school session was running late in one corner, while the apprentices who had already learned their letters were hard at work on winter work in another corner.\n\n\n \"Oh, they've already started. Bye Myne, I have to go!\" Tuuli exclaimed.\n\n\n \"Same here,\" nodded Lutz.\n\n\n Tuuli headed toward the temple school session as Lutz approached the working corner.\n\n\n I myself made my way to a seat where I could see the classroom from a distance great enough to stay out of their way.\n\n\n \"Apprentice, what are they doing?\" Damuel pointed to the corner that held the classroom with a curious look on his face.\n\n\n \"That's where we're teaching the children to read and write.\"\n\n\n \"…You're teaching orphans to read and write? But why?\"\n\n\n In this world, only people of relatively high status and those who worked with them learned to read and write. From their perspective, it made no sense to teach these skills to orphans.\n\n\n However, considering that orphans had a high probability of becoming blue priest assistants, they were more likely to need to be literate than most of the artisans in the lower city. And in terms of increasing the literacy rate, it would be more efficient to start by teaching the people who would benefit most from reading and writing before moving on to the children of artisans, etc.\n\n\n \"The temple orphans will someday be attendants here or servants in the Nobles' quarter, so the sooner they learn to read and do math, the better. It will help them do their jobs someday.\"\n\n\n \"That makes sense. That means they won't have to be trained as much when the time comes.\"\n\n\n As I watched the gray priests at work while the masters helped the children read the children's bibles, writting each letter on their stone chalkboard as they appeared, I discussed the next picture book with Wilma. I showed her a script I had written by examining the thick bible and extracting the information I needed about the subordinate gods and organized them into separate books for each season. She arranged the text here and there, adding some poetic descriptions where they fit.\n\n\n \"Apprentice, what is this?\"\n\n\n \"A copy of the children's bible I made to help the orphans learn to read. They also help them memorize the names of the gods and divine instruments.\"\n\n\n \"Oh?\"\n\n\n Damuel flipped through the children's bible, looking interested.\n\n\n \"It covers the King and Queen of the gods, plus the Five Eternals, and now I plan to make one that covers the subordinate gods. Their names are important for blessings.\"\n\n\n \"These sure are convenient. I had a hard time memorizing the names myself.\"\n\n\n Damuel sighed about how many names one needed to know to properly use magic. If he had that much trouble, then it was a safe bet that a simple illustrated dictionary of the gods would go over well with the nobles. I smiled to myself, mentally calculating the benefit that awaited me now that I had a noble who guarantee it.\n\n\n \"Would you like to play karuta with us, Wilma?\" an orphan asked.\n\n\n \"Certainly. Sister Myne, would you like to join?\"\n\n\n It seemed that it was standard procedure to play karuta after studying their textbooks, as the karuta cards were already on the floor. Tuuli was looking at some of them with a wrinkled face.\n\n\n \"Tuuli, could something bother you by any chance?\"\n\n\n While I was out of my quarters, I kept my rich girl talk manner even when talking to Lutz and Tuuli. Fran and Rosina had ordered me to do so, so despite how unnatural I felt, I forced myself to be extremely polite to Tuuli.\n\n\n She frowned slightly, then whispered in a quiet, embarrassed voice.\n\n\n \"… The thing is, I'm the worst in karuta. Out of everyone.\"\n\n\n The kids at the orphanage had been playing karuta together ever since I gave Gil a set, so even if they didn't know the letters they had the art memorized.\n\n\n Tuuli, on the other hand, still didn't know his letters very well, and it took her a while to get used to all the religious symbolism. She was on a completely different playing field than the children at the orphanage: they played every day, while she could only come to play when the snow wasn't too bad.\n\n\n \"Practice is important, and all you can do is try until you master it. May I suggest focusing only on the gods in the textbook?\"\n\n\n Wilma had drawn the art for both Karuta and the textbook, and both focused on exactly the same themes. If she couldn't win in Karuta until she had memorized them all, she might as well start by concentrating on the ones she had already mostly memorized to give her a head start.\n\n\n \"I'll do my best.\"\n\n\n I also tried Karuta, but the kids were as good as could be expected; it was hardly a competition. Besides, some of the trainees were about to come of age, and if you asked me, it wasn't fair that their arms were much longer than mine.\n\n\n Noon passed and it was time for Tuuli's sewing class. It consisted mostly of girls, and she taught them how to make simple repairs.\n\n\n She had taught the class enough times that she had learned to be a good teacher. The orphans could repair their frayed sleeves, and although they still wore hand-me-down clothes, everything looked much better than before.\n\n\n \"Oh, Gil. Where are you going in such thick clothes?\"\n\n\n I could see a crowd of children centered around Gil, who was wearing thick clothes. There may not have been a snowstorm outside, but it was still snowing a little.\n\n\n \"Lutz told us to get the workshop ready for the parue meeting.\"\n\n\n It was customary to go to meet on clear winter days. Getting ready to leave so early in the morning was a challenge, so it seemed they were being proactive and getting things ready ahead of time.\n\n\n \"In that case, prepare well so you can gather a lot of parues.\"\n\n\n \"Yes!\"\n\n\n Naturally, this was the first time any of the children were going to gather. That said, with so many children on the loose, they would surely get a lot of them. I was really looking forward to seeing how many they would get.\n\n\n After watching the boys run to the workshop to get ready, I heard Tuuli let out a big sigh.\n\n\n \"We won't get many parues this year, since mom can't go.\"\n\n\n I was out of the equation, as usual; Mom was too pregnant to climb trees; and Dad worked enough days of the week that there was no guarantee he would be available. Tuuli was on her own, and she had a feeling there would be no candy waiting for her this winter.\n\n\n \"Tuuli, weren't you going to accompany the children from the orphanage? I had anticipated giving the portion of parues to our family as a thank you.\"\n\n\n It would be too much to expect Lutz to lead all the children alone. My plan was for Tuuli to help, and his payment was the parues portion to our family.\n\n\n \"That sounds great!\", Tuuli exclaimed, eyes sparkling. \"Phew. I was sure I'd have to last through the winter without any parues.\"\n\n\n It had become tradition in our household to get juice from the parues, remove the oil, and bake pies from the leftovers. I intended to do the same at the orphanage this year, so I had bought large metal pans.\n\n\n \"What are parues, apprentice?\" Damuel looked curious, having no idea what we were talking about. It seemed the nobles weren't going to hunt parue.\n\n\n The thought of a noble trying to climb a tree made me smile. His droopy sleeves would get in the way.\n\n\n \"They are fruits that can only be picked from the trees on the morning of clear winter days. Their sweetness is famous in the lower town.\"\n\n\n \"Sister Myne, are parues really that sweet?\"\n\n\n The children who had been surrounding Wilma heard the magic word \"sweet\" and gathered around me, eyes sparkling with anticipation. There were so many mouths to feed at the orphanage that they rarely ate anything sweet, so the thought of the sweet grills practically made them drool.\n\n\n \"Oh, yes, they are quite sweet. I always appreciate them so much.\"\n\n\n \"Wow, I can't wait!\"\n\n\n \"You'll take a lot, Tuuli!\"\n\n\n The children moved forward, wanting to go with Lutz and Tuuli.\n\n\n She smiled at them all.\n\n\n \"Uh huh, we can all go together. but we have to go to the forest super early, so you'll have to get up really early too! Can you do that?\"\n\n\n \"We can do that!\"\n\n\n And so, after several days of heated anticipation, the weather finally calmed down. Dazzling sunlight rained down from early morning, reflecting off the snow and filling the world with a glistening glow that I could see even through my bed curtains.\n\n\n I jumped out of bed before Delia could come and get me, ran to the stairs and leaned over the banister to shout to the second floor.\n\n\n \"Gil! Gil! It's parue meeting day! Go tell the kids at the orphanage, hurry up! Get ready!\"\n\n\n Gil, who had already woken up and dressed, shouted \"Understood!\" and ran out of his room. Delia came running out of her room as well, grabbing my arm with an angry look on her face.\n\n\n \"Sister Myne, please stay in bed until I wake you up! And you shouldn't lean over the rail in your bedclothes like that! Gee, how many times do I have to tell you all this!\"\n\n\n \"Delia, they'll be meeting today. Lutz and Tuuli will be here very soon. I have to go change right away.\"\n\n\n The people of the lower city would rush to get ready before the doors opened on the second bell; Lutz and Tuuli would be here soon, no doubt. But telling Delia that only made her eyes narrow and her voice sharpen.\n\n\n \"That's not part of your agenda!\"\n\n\n \"The clearings in the snowstorm depend on the whims of Ewigeliebe, the God of Life. No one can schedule for them.\"\n\n\n I hurriedly asked Delia to change clothes so I could wait for Tuuli and Lutz. Breakfast could wait until I dismissed them.\n\n\n Fran, seeing how nervous I was, started getting ready for the visitors.\n\n\n My prediction was correct about the money, and Tuuli came running over when she would normally be eating breakfast. I could see Dad behind her.\n\n\n \"Good morning, Myne! Dad is coming with us, he has today off.\"\n\n\n \"Dad, good to see you!\"\n\n\n The moment I saw Dad enter the hallway, I ran and jumped into his arms. He caught me and lifted me up until we were face to face. I rubbed his beard with my hands.\n\n\n \"You seem to be doing well, Myne, have you had a fever lately?\"\n\n\n \"None at all. Fran gets me to bed right away when I start feeling sick, and every time I really get stuck in bed they make me drink a super gross potion. I don't even have time to get a fever.\"\n\n\n \"That's what I like to hear.\"\n\n\n Dad smiled at me and, as I told him how things had been going lately, Tuuli pulled a vial out of his pocket.\n\n\n \"Myne, you mentioned you ran out of this, right?\"\n\n\n Dad left me so I could look at the jar. It was the one that had put natural yeast inside. Tuuli had taken care of it while I was away from home.\n\n\n I hugged the slightly warm jar close to me.\n\n\n \"Thank you, Tuuli.\"\n\n\n \"We just stopped by to give you that and say hello before we gather. Lutz is already at the orphanage!\"\n\n\n \"Okay. Make sure you find lots of them! I'll be waiting with lots of fluffy bread at lunch.\"\n\n\n I watched the two of them outside, then put a hand on my cheek smiling. Even a little time with my family warmed my heart. And now it was time to get ready to make juices and bake cakes.\n\n\n \"Fran, could you deliver this to Ella? And inform her that I'm having lunch with Tuuli, Lutz and Dad. I want her to make me fluffy bread.\"\n\n\n \"Understood.\"\n\n\n Once Fran had the yeast, I turned to Rosina.\n\n\n \"Rosina, once we've finished harspiel practice, go to Wilma and tell her to start getting ready for the parue cakes.\"\n\n\n \"As you wish.\"\n\n\n I practiced harspiel until the third bell, then went to help the High Priest. He told me I looked abnormally happy to the point of being unpleasant, and I responded by saying that, indeed I was, just before I went to work. Just the thought of spending lunch with Tuuli, Lutz and Dad once they returned was enough to make me radiate joy.\n\n\n The fourth bell rang shortly, signifying noon. Damuel saw me to my room, then returned to the High Priest's room.\n\n\n \"I'm going to have lunch now. Make sure you don't leave your room while I'm gone.\"\n\n\n \"Understood, Sir Damuel.\"\n\n\n Damuel ate lunch in the High Priest's room, as the kitchen in my room did not have enough food to cater for the grown man who had suddenly been thrown into the mix.\n\n\n She told me lunch was ready, and I waited for everyone as I wiggled excitedly in my seat.\n\n\n \"We're back, Myne! And we've got lots of them!\"\n\n\n \"Yes!\"\n\n\n All three returned with big, satisfied smiles. The human wave tactics were as effective at gathering parues as I had hoped, and they had really found a lot of them. We munched on the fluffy bread made with the yeast Tuuli had brought me while we talked about our plans for the afternoon.\n\n\n \"Myne, we'll squeeze them out later, but where should we do that - the workshop? Or the dining room?\" Lutz asked.\n\n\n \"We can squeeze them fine in the dining room, but I think it would be faster to get the oil out using the presses in the workshop.\"\n\n\n The workshop had presses meant for squeezing water out of paper, and with the help of Dad and the gray priests, we wouldn't need to smash the parues with hammers before squeezing the oil out. But my suggestion made Lutz hesitate.\n\n\n \"The parues are pretty tough when it's cold, so I have a feeling using hammers in the warm dining room will work better.\"\n\n\n \"Yes, with so many people we could do it all in the dining room, if we have the hammers for it.\"\n\n\n At Lutz and Dad's suggestion, we decided to do it all in the dining room. Tuuli, more concerned about what came after squeezing the parues, looked at me excitedly.\n\n\n \"Where are we going to bake the parue cakes - in the basement of the girls' building, or the workshop?\"\n\n\n \"I was planning to use the basement. If Ella finds out about it and spreads the recipe around town, everyone who feeds their animals parue leftovers would be in trouble, right?\"\n\n\n \"Yes, definitely.\" Lutz scrunched up his face, thinking about his chickens.\n\n\n Parue leftovers were perfect for feeding animals during the winter. If people started cooking with them instead of basically giving them away for free, everyone raising animals would be in big trouble. It would be better if we just enjoyed the parue pies alone; the secret should be safe if we make them in the basement of the orphanage.\n\n\n \"Let's divide our parue shares and have them ready in the dining room, then.\"\n\n\n \"All right!\" exclaimed Tuuli. \"I'll show all the girls how to make parue cakes.\"\n\n\n Once we finished lunch, the three of them hurried to the orphanage to begin their work. I had to wait for Damuel to return before I could go with them.\n\n\n As usual, Delia was the only one who stayed in my rooms, as she didn't want to go to the orphanage.\n\n\n \"Apprentice, what's going on here?\"\n\n\n Damuel stiffened after looking around the orphanage. In one corner there were children poking holes in fruit and pouring the white juice inside into cups, while, in another, several gray priests were violently smashing fruits into juice with hammers. For someone unfamiliar with the parues, it was certainly a strange sight.\n\n\n \"We are squeezing the fruit juice out of the parues and hammering the fruit into juice to get the oil out. The leftovers at the end make delicious sweets and I'm sure the girls are working hard cooking them in the basement.\"\n\n\n Tuuli's lesson must have gone well, judging by the sweet, fluffy aroma comming up from the basement. They should be making buttery parue cakes, mixing the goat's milk and eggs I had asked Wilma for that morning with parue juice. I closed my eyes and inhaled deeply, filling my nose with a sweet aroma.\n\n\n Not long after I asked Rosina and Fran to prepare dishes, Tuuli came upstairs with a plate full of cake.\n\n\n \"Oh, you're already here? Perfect. We're already baking lots of them.\"\n\n\n Behind Tuuli was another apprentice, carrying a plate with a similarly high of parue cakes. They both set their plates in front of me.\n\n\n \"You keep an eye on her, Myne. Make sure no one grabs any before everyone is done,\" Tuuli said, and I nodded with a smile.\n\n\n There was no one in the orphanage who would risk taking food from a blue shrine maiden apprentice without permission. At least they knew they wouldn't eat again after the first one.\n\n\n \"Wow, that smells so good!\"\n\n\n \"I want to have one!\"\n\n\n Some of the kids who had been squeezing the parues rushed over after smelling the parue cakes.\n\n\n \"They won't eat until all the work is done. Remember: those who don't work, don't eat.\"\n\n\n My reminder sent the children hurrying back to their workplaces, and in the midst of their footsteps I heard a loud gulp come from behind me. I instinctively turned around and saw Damuel looking at the parue cakes.\n\n\n \"What are those, apprentice…\"\n\n\n It was written all over his face that he wanted to eat one. I figured that, as a nobleman, he had sugar and could eat sweets with some regularity, so I could only guess that he was just interested in trying something new.\n\n\n \"Parue cakes, made from parues. This must be the first time you've seen them if you haven't had parues before. Would you like to eat them with us?\"\n\n\n \"Ahem! Good. I'm a little interested in what people eat here, since I'll be coming here quite often from now on.\"\n\n\n Once all the parues were finished, the girls and boys took the juice, oil and leftovers to the basement while the boys took the tools they had used to the children's building. Fran and Rosina separated the parue cakes and began distributing them to the children, who were lined up with plates in hand. I asked Gil to give a parue cake to Delia, and to reserve plates for the children who had been helping Ella in the kitchen in my room.\n\n\n They were all sitting in the dining room with plates in front of them; Fran had set plates and silverware taken from my rooms in front of Damuel and me.\n\n\n \"Now, let us pray.\"\n\n\n At my words, all the children crossed their arms in front of their chests and began their pre-meal prayer.\n\n\n \"O mighty King and Queen of the endless heavens who honor us with thousands upon thousands of lives to consume, O mighty Eternal Five who rule the mortal realm, I offer you thanks and prayers, and partake of the meal so graciously provided.\"\n\n\n Dad and Tuuli listened to the soft prayer with a dazed look on their faces. It was the same prayer I had memorized. I looked at Damuel and saw that he too was saying the prayer without hesitation. It seemed that the nobles had to say the same prayers.\n\n\n After finishing the prayer, the children began to stuff the parue cakes into their mouths as if it were a race. They took a bite myself as I watched.\n\n\n \"Wow, so good!\"\n\n\n \"So sweet!\"\n\n\n The kids let out squeals of delight as they tucked into the delicious treat, but Damuel froze beside me. He swallowed saliva with wide eyes.\n\n\n \"Apprentice, does everyone in the lower city eat this?\"\n\n\n \"They don't. This is a special treat, just for us. do you like it?\", I asked.\n\n\n Damuel let out a slow sigh.\n\n\n \"It's too good. Is it just me, or do the children here live like nobles? They're eating sweets like these and they're learning to read and write…\"\n\n\n \"This is an orphanage; I imagine they don't live like nobles. They picked these parues themselves from a snowy forest early in the morning. They can only be collected in the morning on sunny winter days, and they are not sold anywhere.\"\n\n\n Damuel continued to eat his parue pie with an astonished expression on his face, and from then on he always made a point of going to the orphanage on sunny winter days. He seemed to really like parue cakes.\n\n\n And he wasn't the only one; everyone at the orphanage loved them.\n\n\n \"Sister Myne, these are delicious.\"\n\n\n \"When is the next sunny day coming?\"\n\n\n \"There are still plenty of parue leftovers,\" I replied, \"so we can make more later. And the leftovers can also be used for other recipes, so look forward to it.\"\n\n\n As a result of having taught Wilma and the other cooks at the orphanage the parue cake recipe I had taught Lutz's family, the battle for parues at the orphanage became more intense than ever."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Due to the potion and the magic tool, Myne fell into a deep slumber. Ferdinand looked at her in silence. He moved to pick up the hair stick that Myne dropped from her slacked hand. Even though it was just a mediocre stick made from wood, Myne always tied her hair with it. He initially believed that it was a norm amongst commoners, but not one of the many hairsticks he saw at the Baptism Ceremony were poked through bundled hair. Only Myne used the sticks this way.\n\n\n Myne was a strange kid. She carried herself in a manner as though she had been educated in a very academic place, but yet she was so clumsy with herself. She had mentioned someone named “Melvil Dewey”, who invented a system for sorting catalogues. But after a deep investigation, this man she spoke of and his system did not exist. Inventions necessary to her popped up incessantly. She rebuilt the orphanage and made the children work, so that the labour they provided would help pay for their necessities. She was so deeply infatuated with books that she even made bibles for the orphans.\n\n\n There was no denying that Myne was a strange one. Not even a noble child, who received a strict education, could replicate what Myne had done. She didn’t resemble the stature of a small child who had just received her baptism. Although she was weird, her actions carried no malicious intentions.\n\n\n If Myne’s actions were only that of curiosity, the Archduke would not hand over the magic tool to Ferdinant. However, during the Healing Ritual, Myne had demonstrated an immeasurable amount of mana. It was nearly impossible for a typical child with Devouring to refill the land that did not have any mana at such a fast speed. He suspected that she possessed more mana than the Archduke. No one could tell how much mana Myne would have when she reached her adulthood.\n\n\n A commoner child with this much mana and the wisdom to produce so many priceless inventions. Just to gain the rights over her, the nobles might just go to war. To help secure Myne some safety, Ferdinand declared that she was in his custody, but it won’t take long before rumours of her spread amongst the nobles. For now, he could give his assurance that Myne would be safe, but he did not know if she was important enough to deserve his protection.\n\n\n The Archduke was aware of all these, so he offered him the magic tool to comb through her memories to see the world in her dreams that she previously mentioned. He had to judge her worth, and evaluate the possible harm she may or may not cause.\n\n\n “Well then, at least allow me to verify that she means no harm…” It was easy to judge if someone was a criminal by looking through their memories. However, for Myne, by reading her memories, he had to determine if she was worth it and to foresee her future plans, both of which were difficult to do.\n\n\n “…What’s hardest is that Myne will not be happy about it.” After all he was using a magic tool to look into her memories, so of course she would be on edge around him and avoid him whenever possible.\n\n\n To be a noble, one had to bury away their feelings and be extremely careful with their actions, so that they don’t put themselves into danger, hence there was no one in the noble society who had all their thoughts plastered on their faces like Myne. The rules applied to Ferdinand in the temple too Ferdinand had to always be on his toes around everyone while he determined if they were close to the High Bishop and if they were trustworthy. Yet he did not feel the need to be cautious around Myne. Even though she was a pain in the neck sometimes, her pure nature made her thoughts and feelings predictable and easy to read. This comfort made Ferdinand put down his defences.\n\n\n This was beyond my expectations, but it seems that I am quite fond of Myne, sighed Ferdinand.\n\n\n He placed an ornament in his head that looked just like that of Myne’s, and then knelt beside the bench Myne was on. After that, he pressed the jewel on his crown onto Myne’s one. He gradually allowed his mana to flow into her which allowed their minds to sync. It was typical for anyone to resist a foreign mana. The potion Myne drank served to weaken this resistance, yet she accepted the mana without any side effects. Although this was convenient, Ferdinand had the urge to chastise her to be a little more defensive and less trusting of others.\n\n\n He clicked his tongue and said,“Myne, can you hear me?”\n\n\n “What- I can, High Priest, but where are you?” Ferdinand expected Myne to be afraid or disgusted by this, but she gave a nonchalant expression like this was nothing strange. He wanted to chastise her again.\n\n\n “I am connecting our minds. You seemed to possess more mana than I expected. You mentioned that all the knowledge you have is from the world in your dreams. It is necessary for me to evaluate the effect of your actions on this land, whether it is for the good or bad. I am deeply sorry, but I will have to look into your memories.”\n\n\n “Oh, I see. I don’t mind,” responded Myne without concern which shocked Ferdinand. She had no concerns that someone had barged into her mind to look at her memories.\n\n\n “To clarify this, I will be seeing your actual memories. Are you really fine with that? Do you not feel that this is intruding on your privacy?.”\n\n\n “Of course, uhm, it’s not a pleasant thing, but… you looking at my memories will raise my chances of staying alive. It’s much better to let you do so than to be executed for some treason I didn’t commit. Plus, I’m already privileged enough that you’re willing to look through my memories and not be sentenced to death right now, right?” said Myne.\n\n\n As they were mentally linked, Ferdinand knew that she was being truthful. Should he be impressed that she was understanding or reprimand her for not being careful around others? Of course the latter, but he would save the scolding for after. He wanted to finish up Myne’s inspection as soon as possible as the process was likely to be draining.\n\n\n “Now then, would you take me to the said world in your dreams? Try to recall it and we should be able to go there.”\n\n\n “Wait a moment, does that mean I can go anywhere I want?”\n\n\n …Why?! Why is Myne so excited that her own memories are about to be searched?!\n\n\n Myne was looking forward to being searched and these feelings of her’s were sent straight to Ferdinand, and this did nothing but worry him.\n\n\n This doesn’t look good. I have a bad feeling. Will I be able to stop Myne if she loses control? If I don’t firm myself, she might drag me on tour across all her memories.\n\n\n “Myne, you only need to show me what I’ll need to see. First, show me the beginning of your knowledge.”\n\n\n “No problem! We’ll start with my favourite place - the library!” Myne exclaimed in joy.\n\n\n In the next instant Ferdinand found himself in front of a large and exquisite building. He wanted to look up to see how tall it was, unfortunately could only look through Myne’s eyes, so his point of view was limited. Instead, what came to view was a neatly paved stone pathway, and a gentle gust of wind flowed across his skin. There was no wretched smell of manure like that of the lower city, so the building must have been in the Noble’s District.\n\n\n “Aaah, it’s been forever!” Myne’s voice reverberated around them.\n\n\n Ferdinand realised that they were approaching the building. She was relishing in nostalgia as she skipped into the building, so this was likely the world she always talked about. A glass door he had never seen so transparent slid to the side with a humming sound, but Myne did not use any mana to activate it, let alone touch it.\n\n\n “Myne, do you use magic here too? But if I remember correctly, you said that the Dewey Decimal System didn’t have a section on magic.”\n\n\n “Ah… Magic doesn’t exist here. It’s an automatic door that runs differently.”\n\n\n They don’t have magic, but they possess something else that fulfills the same purpose. How strange but interesting.\n\n\n “Myne, what country is this? I haven’t heard of a place like this before.”\n\n\n “It’s called Japan. I used to live here. I died here because I was crushed by books. Before I knew it, I was in Myne’s body.”\n\n\n Ferdinand was completely lost with what Myne was talking about. But he knew that Myne was speaking the truth due to her honest personality. Never before did Ferdinand come across someone so difficult to understand because they were honest.\n\n\n “…You died, from being crushed by books?”\n\n\n He could not imagine how she could be crushed to death because he didn’t believe that there were enough books in existence to crush someone.\n\n\n Next off, he found themselves surrounded by towering bookcases, each of them were filled to the brim with books.\n\n\n “…Where’s this?”\n\n\n “The local public library I visited all the time.”\n\n\n It was a library packed with an impossible number of bookshelves, lining the halls as far as one could see. Not even the Royal Academy could par up to this. Now it seemed plausible how someone could be crushed to death by books.\n\n\n “Is everything here… books?”\n\n\n “Mhmm, this is a library. Oh, but over the last couple of years, libraries also have videos, CDs, and DVDs. Ah, I’m so happy. This is it! This is the very paradise I have been looking for!”\n\n\n Ferdinand could tell that Myne was about to breakdown from sheer bliss. She ran across the bookshelves to her favourite spot. All across the library’s floor, a soft carpet had been laid out and it muffled the sound of her footsteps. Ferdinand felt his head throb just thinking about the insane amount of money it took to build this place .\n\n\n …I see. Seeing how much she loves books and has memories of a library this amazing, I can sort of understand why she was so disappointed at the temple’s book room.\n\n\n The books here were treasured items, everything was completely different from his world. The books at this library were not chained, so Myne was able to pick up and read any book she wanted. Each of them had designs similar to those she made in the temple.\n\n\n The library was filled with people from all walks of life - men, women, seniors, and children. Everyone wore a vibrant array of colours, some wore intricate garments that displayed their wealth, while others wore rough clothes that showcased that they were from the poorer side. But even the seemingly poorer ones were touching the books. From Ferdinand’s point of view, it was baffling that poor people were allowed to touch books.\n\n\n “Myne, is that woman insane? How can a crazy person like her be allowed here?”\n\n\n “A crazy woman? Who?” Myne’s eyes swept across the hall.\n\n\n “To your left. She’s a grown woman but her knees are exposed. She must be too poor to afford better clothes, but she continues to dye her clothes. Why doesn’t she just stop dying them? I can’t understand her.”\n\n\n “Don’t worry. In this world, women can wear anything they wish to, so everyone’s just wearing whatever they want. Anyways, this dream is simply amazing. I can still retain my sense of touch and smell.”\n\n\n Myne lost interest in the woman and returned her attention to the bookshelf. The books on the shelves had paperbacks similar to those Myne made, but their designs were more intricate. Furthermore, there were more of them than Ferdinand could ever imagine.\n\n\n Myne looked across the shelves before taking a book off of the bookshelf. She hugged it close to her body and took in a deep breath, taking in its scent. As their minds were linked, Ferdinand smelled the scent of paper and ink, and he felt that sense of satisfaction Myne had too. He wanted to quit this now.\n\n\n Myne walked to the end of the shelves and sat in a snug sofa, she flipped open the book and began reading. The book was not like the ones he knew with boards tied up together. The chair was soft and very nice to sit on. It was unlike Ferdinand had ever experienced. As always, his sight was only limited to Myne’s, so only the book, floor and bookshelf was in view. He could see inside the book, but they were filled with unfamiliar letters mushed together. The book was mostly likely printed with the method Myne mentioned before. The pages looked just like the ones she made, they were just black and white\n\n\n “Do the books from your dreams not have pictures?”\n\n\n “Wah-?! Huh? Who is… Oh, wait. It’s just you, High Priest.” Myne let out a surprised yelp when Ferdinand asked her.\n\n\n …I can’t believe this fool. Even though I’m still here, she got lost in her own world.\n\n\n “Um, pictures, right? The pictures are usually in artbooks and photobooks.” Myne pulled out a heavy book with pages full of coloured pictures. The pictures had so much colour to it and had the tiniest of detail to it, it was outstanding to look at. Ferdinand was amazed by it, but Myne shut the book immediately.\n\n\n “Can I go back to my reading, High Priest?”\n\n\n “No, you’re not allowed to. Is this one of those picture books for children that you made before?”\n\n\n “This is an artbook, a collection of art pieces from a famous person, and they have compiled them in a book. The children’s section is over there,” said Myne as she resumed her tour around the library.\n\n\n “This is a picture book, and this is what the story about Cinderella is supposed to look like.”\n\n\n Ferdinand was confused by the art in the picture book and the story Myne had told him before. No one in the world had eyes that occupied so much space on their face, and no one would have clothes or hair like that. Or, well, there is a possibility such a person exists here.\n\n\n “…The story is even more ludicrous with this drawing now, but it utilises quite a number of bright colours. You need to put color in yours too.”\n\n\n “I have plans to do so, but ink is too expensive, and it’s not that easy to make. How I wish I could just buy the stuff I need here,” said Myne, and in the next instant they moved to somewhere else with bookshelves too. Instead of being lined with books, the shelves had strange… things littered with those weird letters and colours.\n\n\n “Oh, we’re in an art supply store. High Priest, will the stuff I buy here still be with me even after I wake up?”\n\n\n “Of course not, you fool. Where are we?”\n\n\n “It’s an art supply stop that I frequented with my mum. This is called paint.” Myne’s world was filled with such a wide array of things, anything from books to paint. Furthermore, the sheer quantity and quality of them was outstanding. Of course, he could know of things Myne showed him, but the amount of culture in her memories was enough to blow him away. Or, to put it another way, her actions were erratic because her thinking were chaotic.\n\n\n “There are so many different shades of paint.”\n\n\n “Mhmm. They sell lots of things here. But I prefer bookstores to this.” Once again, they teleported to another place. Myne’s thinking seemed to be as chaotic as her actions. Maybe it would be better to say that she acted this chaotic because of her way of thinking.\n\n\n “Where are we?” It was a place with shelves full of books, just like the library. Unlike the library, however, there was loud music playing, and the light was so strong that Ferdinand want to squint.\n\n\n “A store that sells new books. Hehehe, let’s see what’s new… Wait, nooooo! There’s only books I can rememberrrrrr!”\n\n\n Myne suddenly became unhappy and yelled something incoherent. It was exhausting to be forced to feel her mood swings. Perhaps the frequency with which she collapsed was because of the severity of her rollercoaster emotions.\n\n\n “Myne, why is it so bright even though we are inside a building?”\n\n\n “Oh, that’s because of electricity.” Myne raised her head, above the bookshelves was a row of miniature suns that emitted a strong light.\n\n\n “How do they work?”\n\n\n “Um, the lights go one when you flip a switch. It will be tough for you to understand the concept even if I try to explain it. It’s just like how I can’t understand an explanation of magic without trying to study it first.”\n\n\n Myne’s interest went back to the shelves. Since she didn’t look around, he could see books. There were some intriguing and foregin things in her peripheral, but it didn’t seem like she would turn her attention to them. This investigation didn’t seem like it was going to be a meaningful one.\n\n\n “Myne, let’s move on from the books.”\n\n\n “Awww, why? All I want to do is look at books. I can’t have such realistic dreams on my own.” Myne was dissatisfied to the core. She only cared for books.\n\n\n Ferdinand never expected to find nothing but books in her memories when he decided to look into her mind. All of this would have been for naught if he didn’t force her to think about something else. He needed something else than her knowledge about this world’s books.\n\n\n “Myne, do you recall my purpose for being here?”\n\n\n “How I wish I could forget… Fine. What would you like to see next?” Myne let out a deep sigh. Ferdinand pondered it for a moment before asking what piqued his interest the most.\n\n\n “Well then. I would like to see the place you received your education.”\n\n\n In an instant, their surroundings changed. They were in a small room with desks lined up across the floor. Behind each of them were people wearing the same clothes, sitting and writing on them.\n\n\n On the small desks, there were books filled with thin pieces of paper, and the paper had weird letters and symbols on them. There were metal containers with many colourful sticks on the table. The people here would look up every now and then as they scribbled letters with the sticks, which they used as pens. An adult stood at the front of the class, writing on a giant slate, he was likely explaining what he was writing. This person was probably a teacher in this school.\n\n\n “Myne, what’s going on?”\n\n\n “We’re in class. If I’m not wrong, this is a memory from high school? It’s math class now. This is so nostalgic but I never really enjoyed studying math. I’m more of a language person.” Their surroundings changed again. It was still in the same room, but an older woman was walking around while reading a book.\n\n\n “This is how everyone gets educated in this country. We start way before the age children get baptised and continue until we reach adulthood.” As she spoke, the room altered again and again. Each room had people studied, but their ages and the instructor who taught them were different each time. It was true that they continued studying from a child to an adult.\n\n\n “Is studying all you do?”\n\n\n “Umm, we do study a wide range of subjects, some of them are more practical.”\n\n\n Their surroundings were rapidly changing. They were outside, where students dressed the same ran around a track. A man was almost naked dove into water. Next, a body of students were playing a song he didn’t know of on an odd-looking flute…\n\n\n “So you have studied music before…”\n\n\n “Yup. Though schools don’t teach music in depth. I didn’t compose the song I played on my harspiel, I learnt the song from school.”\n\n\n Ferdinand finally understood why she was able to play a tune on the first ever harpspiel she had touched. Myne’s extraordinary abilities were a result of the world’s knowledge and the rigorous education she obtained here, so it was only natural that she would be unlike any other commoner.\n\n\n “The education system was introduced by the local government, it makes sure that everyone here is able to read and do calculations. I’d like the orphanage to be educated this way so that everyone be literate, write and do simple calculations.”\n\n\n “Why would you do so?” Ferdinand did not understand Myne’s view that everyone should be taught to read. Myne quickly responded to his question.\n\n\n “If more people are literate, there will be more people to read books. And people need to be literate so that they can write books. If I want to enjoy reading for the rest of my life in your world, I first need to get everyone to read.”\n\n\n Until now, Ferdinand had been wondering whether there were some malicious intentions to her acts, that she was acting on the command of some evil plot, but now that they were linked, he was completely sure that she was just addicted to reading books and nothing else. That was reassuring in some ways, but it still gave him a headache for other reasons. Nevertheless, her memories tied up all the loose ends he had about her.\n\n\n “…I knew that you learned to read at an exceptional pace, but I see that was because you were used to being educated.”\n\n\n “Being used to learning? Hm, I guess so. I’ve never really put much thought into it, but it seems that I’ve been studying for my whole life. Anyways, I forced myself to learn the letters because I wanted to read books that badly.”\n\n\n Ferdinand soaked up whatever he could see. It was nice seeing students studying peaceful, neatly dressed in identical clothing. There was no evident filth everywhere in this premise.\n\n\n “Myne, this place is truly lovely.”\n\n\n “That’s because it’s a new building. But what’s the best about this school is that it has the largest library of any of the nearby schools. That is why I chose to attend this school\n\n\n They had returned to another library. There was no doubt that this was the school library she praised with glee. The unmistakable dusty smell in the air indicated that there were many old books here. Myne enthusiastically breathed its scent in, but Ferdinand had grown tired of smelling books.\n\n\n “Myne, we’re done with the libraries. Take me outside.” Their environment changed into a peaceful and pretty garden. There was a stoned pathway, a green patch of grass, and flowerbeds that laid adjacent to a row of trees.\n\n\n “Is this the Noble’s District?”\n\n\n “Mm, yes and no. I’d say that the entire Japan closely resembles the Noble’s District than the lower city. We use tools similar to magic tools here.” The concept of a world that utilised magic tools that didn’t run on mana fascinated Ferdinand.\n\n\n “Oh? Such as?”\n\n\n “I guess, we can use our vehicles as an example.” Myne turned upward and pointed at something white in the sky. It was soaring in the sky while making a deafening clamor. She turned around to look at small metal structures travelling together at a fast pace along large pavements.\n\n\n “What are those? It must cost quite some mana to move these metal structures at such a speed.”\n\n\n “I said this before, these aren’t magic tools that run on mana. They use something else to work. Honestly, I find jewels that glow and move on mana much stranger.” After giving some thought into it, magic stones that changed colour and shape would be strange for Myne who came from a world that operated on no mana. She was always surprised by everything when she was with the Knight Order. .\n\n\n “What other tools do you use here?”\n\n\n “Mmm, it would probably be home electronics?” Myne muttered, and they teleported into another building.\n\n\n The windows were draped in a fine lace linen. Using a laced curtain as a plain one suggested that they were in an archnoble’s dwelling. A modest light streamed through the curtains, and the room was further brightened by a so-called “lightbulb.” In front of it was a leather couch was large black rectangle on top of a short cabinet.\n\n\n …What?\n\n\n Myne’s heartbeat started to accelerate. Her back was drenched in sweat, and her face turned pale. Myne was getting overwhelmed with anxiety, tension, and terror. Yet, deep down, there was a mixture of joy and reminiscence building up. Ferdinand’s brain reeled as a result of her emotional outburst.\n\n\n “Myne, what’s wrong? Did something happen?”\n\n\n “This is the living room in my house. It’s so nostalgic…I’m feeling some… pain.”Myne murmured in a hoarse tone as her chest tightened. Ferdinand could tell she was on the verge of crying. He had mostly dismissed it the first time she said it since she was so engrossed in her books, but Myne had explained that after dying here, she had become Myne in his world. In that scenario, it was only natural for someone to feel this emotional when they returned to their old home. But he wasn’t going to let himself be manipulated by Myne’s feelings\n\n\n Ferdinand coughed to clear his mind before speaking to Myne. “There’s a lot of stuff on that shelf. “What are they?”\n\n\n “…Those are my mother’s works.” She gets interested in anything, but she gives up easily, she moves onto something else after making one or two of them. Of course she can’t make anything great if she doesn’t practice more…”\n\n\n Even after saying this, Myne reached out to a careful graze across them which contradicted her previous disdainful remarks. “This is a hairpin, and this is a coaster made of lace. These hairpins are now available for purchase at the Gilberta Company. This was the inspiration for the elegant hair stick I made.”\n\n\n Ferdinand remembered that Myne wore a hair stick when she assisted the Knight’s Order. Hers was better, and it looked a lot like the hairpin on the shelf.\n\n\n “These baskets were made out of ad papers coiled up into sticks. I used my experience making these to make the baskets for my winter craft. The bag I always carry around was made the same way. Mom, on the other hand, got tired of it after making half of it so I finished it for her instead”\n\n\n Myne bit on her lips and pointed at the basket.\n\n\n “These are dolls and plush animals, I know they look shabby. She only finished the head of the white and spherical one, it’s supposed to be a snowman. Here’s an uncompleted patched tapestry…”\n\n\n The shabby basket was used to store many unfinished projects. Myne removed them and spoke about the past with each one. With each one she touched, their surroundings shifted to a different scene. They all had a black-haired woman who was either persuading Myne to accompany her or complaining that she was done with it. This lady was most likely Myne’s previous mother.\n\n\n “All her artwork looks the same,” Myne added as she walked out of the room and into a tiny corridor. The hall suddenly lit up when she touched a rectangular thing.\n\n\n “What just happened?!”\n\n\n “Oh, that was electricity. The same thing you saw at the bookstore.” Myne raised her eyes and pointed to a white light that was considerably smaller than the one he had previously seen. This rectangle thing used something similar to mana.\n\n\n Many works of art hung on the walls of the now-bright hall. Each was crudely constructed, to the point where Ferdinand agreed with Myne when she said her mother’s skills were lacking.\n\n\n “Aren’t they all over the place?” She made her own watercolour and oil paintings, and even a nihonga, she wanted to prove a point that her other paintings were bad due to the materials. She used coloured pencils as a last ditch effort before giving up on art. She then moved on to calligraphy, she thought letters would be simple. She took me to the tea ceremony and flower arrangement class because she believed they were skills I needed to get married. In the end, she was the one who gave up and stopped attending them.”\n\n\n Myne chuckled as she wiped away the tears that welled up. Ferdinand could sense that she was feeling an indescribable sense of yearning and love. He struggled to relate to her as he was estranged from his family.\n\n\n “There was a period when we attempted to do everything ourselves in order to save money and to get closer to Mother Nature. She got so wrapped up in it that I hoped she’d stop bothering me, but… it’s because of her that I could survive as Myne.”\n\n\n Myne mentioned that she first learned to make the rinsham, soap, hide glue, ink, and the others here. Her vision began to blur as she began to tear up.\n\n\n “I’m sorry, High Priest. It’s been a while…”\n\n\n Myne covered her face with her hand beneath her eyes as she dashed into a small room. She stood in front of a porcelain bowl underneath a cabinet and had a metal rod protruding from it. She picked up a nice and fluffy cloth. She then gripped and twisted a handle on the metal rod.\n\n\n “What?! Water?!” Water gushed out of the metal rod. Myne splashed her face and wiped it dry with the cloth. The cloth seemed to be used as a towl.\n\n\n …The cloth feels nice to the touch. If only there was a way for us to bring it back.\n\n\n “Myne, what is this room used for?”\n\n\n “It’s a bathroom. Over there is the bathtub. That long thing is a showerhead.” Just after she spoke, they appeared inside the bathtub filled with a perfume scented water. She splashed around in the bathtub like a child which made her bare skin peek out of the white hot water. She was completely indifferent to what Ferdinand thought about this.\n\n\n “Amazing! A bath! The bath salt smells amazing. This peach scent was my favourite.”\n\n\n “Do you have no dignity, you fool?! What part of you is supposed to act as a chaste and prim lady?!”Ferdinand screamed but their minds being linked forced him to continue watching. Myne didn’t care and continued dipping her face in the hot water.\n\n\n “It’s fine, I don’t mind. I’ve lost all my pride the moment I became Myne. You don’t have to worry about it. I’m a kid anyways, there’s nothing to be ashamed about.”\n\n\n On her third day in Myne’s body, she was forced to change her clothes by a guy who didn’t see her father yet. Nothing changed no matter how much she sobbed or screamed in embarrassment. She had no choice but to accept her predicament, and her ability to feel humiliated died that day.\n\n\n “I’m not your father!”\n\n\n So she claimed, but having Ferdinand be bothered about her body and her washing in front of him were two irrelevant things. He hadn’t expected her to be as lacking in shame as she was in caution.\n\n\n “I’m more concerned about your lack of shame!”\n\n\n “It’s not like I won’t regain my sense of shame when I grow older.” Myne got out of the tub, her body was covered in scented bubbles as she began washing her hair while singing.\n\n\n “Haaa, there’s so many bubbles! I love it! This is the best feeling ever!” Myne trembled with delight and happiness as she pulled on what she called a showerhead. Water streamed out of it like rain when she yanked on it in a certain way.\n\n\n “Nghaaah?!”\n\n\n “This washes away the soap.” Myne washed the bubbles out of her hair in the shower. Ferdinand had found it odd that she bathed alone, but now he realized that cleaning oneself here did not require the assistance of others.\n\n\n “It’s not like washing it here will do anything in reality.”\n\n\n “But I’ll feel so much better. Tralalala…”\n\n\n Myne wiped her body with honey-scented soap after washing her hair. Its texture, scent, and amount of bubbles were of a better quality than the soap used by the royalty.\n\n\n Myne’s heart swelled with joy once she finished soaping herself and rinsing everything off with water.\n\n\n “You’re happy enough, Myne, but I’d prefer to move on from this.”\n\n\n Their environment changed again and they were standing in front of the identical white tub they had been in previously. Myne selected an interesting item off an adjacent shelf. The item was blue and shiny. Ferdinand couldn’t tell what it was made of. He couldn’t come up with an idea of what it was made of because it didn’t look like metal. When Myne moved her finger, it made a loud, irritating buzzing sound and a hot gush of hair, enough to burn the skin, flowed out of it.\n\n\n “What on earth is that?!”\n\n\n “A hair dryer.”\n\n\n There was even an exquisite mirror in the bathroom. Myne appeared to be the daughter of a noble of a higher status than he had expected.\n\n\n “High Priest, this is a hair tie made of rubber, and it can be used to tie the hair like this.” After putting the noisy hair dryer, Myne began to tug and shrink the “rubber” hair tie in some way. “Have you ever come across something that can stretch and contract like this?”\n\n\n “…Not in Ehrenfest. But I heard that something called the gumbak bark does this.”\n\n\n “Wait, so there’s something like this?! Where?! How much does it cost to import it?” She was thinking like a merchant.\n\n\n Ferdinand sighed as he watched Myne try to invent a new product at this time. She was definitely trying to invent a plethora of new things that mimicked what she knew from this world. She definitely went through a lot of trouble to gather the right materials needed.\n\n\n “Gumka trees are way too far north, and because they are feytrees, you’ll have to fight and kill them before you can collect their bark. They carry mana in the same way that trombes do, but they fight in a different way.”\n\n\n “Trombes, huh…” Myne sighed. She tied up her long and night-sky-colored hair in a bun. The hair tie seemed strange to Ferdinand because he was used to seeing her bundle her hair with a stick.\n\n\n “So this isn’t a hair stick?”\n\n\n “Oh, I only made a hair stick as a substitute. I usually wear a hair stick with a Japanese kimono. Mmm, I guess an occasion like that would be the Coming of Age Ceremony?”\n\n\n Myne combed through her memories, and made their surroundings transform to a snowy day. The air was cold and there was a large group of youths dressed in garishly colored costumes that Ferdinand had never seen before. He guessed this was something like the Royal Academy’s graduation ceremony because she called it a Coming of Age Ceremony. The clothes were lovely and the cloth was long, everyone here must have been a noble\n\n\n “There’s something called ryuusuimon here. It’s a type of pattern on the kimono and I embroidered it on my ceremonial robes.”\n\n\n “Ah, I see. It does look similar.”\n\n\n There was a woman wearing a hairpin that was more detailed than Myne’s hair stick had. She wore a red dress decorated with embroidery that looked like waves and flowers, the design looked like that on Myne’s ceremonial robes.\n\n\n “Myne, is that embroidery?”\n\n\n “Umm, some parts of a long-sleeved kimono uses embroidery, its quite rare to see embroidery on the sleeves. We typically draw it on the cloth with yuuzen dye”\n\n\n “Drawing on the cloth? How does that work?” Ferdinand only believed that the paint would smudge and blur out, before damaging and destroying the entire cloth.\n\n\n “…So that doesn’t exist in the Noble’s District?”\n\n\n “We do change the colour of threads for sewing and embroidering. I’ve never heard of a method that draws onto the cloth.”\n\n\n “Oooh, that’s interesting. Benno could profit from this.” Myne giggled. She was coming up with ways to take advantage of this\n\n\n “I understand. You are just as valuable as the knowledge you bring from this world.”\n\n\n “My mother was the one who taught me though.” Myne laughed.\n\n\n They returned to the hall and opened another door. Inside, Ferdinand found himself in a strange room filled with unusual objects.\n\n\n “This is my house’s kitchen. We prepare and eat there. This over here is a gas stove. You just need to push down on this to make a fire. Convenient, right?”\n\n\n Myne pressed a weird looking squared object, it made a clicking sound and fire appeared. The blue flame swayed back and forth. The flames in this world appeared to be blue. What was bewildering was that the fire didn’t go out when Myne withdrew her hand. Starting a fire was a simple task if you knew magic, but maintaining it required a lot of wood and mana.\n\n\n Ferdinand’s eyes widened in surprise, of course in his imagination, when he discovered that the fire burned without any wood or mana, Myne pressed the button another time and the fire was extinguished, as if it had never been there at all.\n\n\n “…Myne, what is that large white box?”\n\n\n “That’s a refrigerator. It keeps the food inside cold, so it doesn’t go bad that quicklyt.”\n\n\n When Myne opened the door, a cold gush of air rushed forward. Ferdinand didn’t know any of the colorful items inside, but the fridge didn’t startle him as much as the gas stove did because he was familiar with the idea of preserving food with cold temperatures. He was only impressed by its miniature size.\n\n\n “Aaah, an ice room.”\n\n\n “Wait, you have a refrigerator?”\n\n\n “You didn’t know? The ice room in the temple is much bigger than this room. I believe that Fran uses it quite frequently.”\n\n\n “I always found it weird that you always serve more milk whenever you have visitors, but I didn’t know that they came from the refrigerator. Why didn’t I know about this…,” Myne trailed off in melancholy.\n\n\n “I could have made more food.”\n\n\n Fran did tell Ferdinand what sort of food Myne was eating, but he couldn’t tell what it was with his description, he just knew that she had quite a variety. Was she planning to expand her collection?\n\n\n “…I’m aware that you eat lots of food in your room. Are they from this world too?”\n\n\n “Yep, I’ve been trying to recreate Western dishes here… Wait, will the food here taste just like how I remembered them to be?! Should I try it? I think I might be hungry.”\n\n\n Myne was getting happier by the moment as she took in her surroundings. Then something popped into her mind, and their environment shifted once more. They were in the same room, but had moved to the other side and there was some noise from the back.\n\n\n “If you’re hungry, hurry up and eat. I can’t wash the dishes if you haven’t eaten them, right?” A woman’s voice came from their back. Myne’s heart skipped a beat, and she turned stiff like a stone. Though she was reprimanding Myne, the woman’s voice felt soothing to Myne, but it was most likely because Myne was feeling emotional. Myne clenched her fist and turned around. They saw a black-haired lady places dishes on the table, she was the same black-haired lady who had been appearing in Myne’s memories.\n\n\n “…Mum.”\n\n\n “I made your favorite food tonight. Eat it before it gets cold.”\n\n\n Myne nodded slightly and made her way to the table large enough for four. Myne’s memories were recreating a full lunch on the table that wasn’t in the kitchen moments ago. The dish was so nostalgic that the sight alone made Myne tear up, but Ferdinand had no idea what it was. It was black and brown, and he didn’t find it very appetizing.\n\n\n “Are you sure this is food, Myne?”\n\n\n “Yes. It’s everything I’ve been craving for. There’s a bowl of hot white rice, miso soup with tofu and seaweed, plus lots of scallions. There’s some teriyaki, along with mom’s meat and potato stew with hijiki and her pickled veggies.”\n\n\n Myne took in a breath of the food, relishing in its scent to fully enjoy her native cuisine. Her eyes were full of tears and had her hands clasped together. She bowed her head as though she way praying\n\n\n “I’m home.”\n\n\n The tears that welled up in her eyes finally trickled down her cheeks as she deftly used the two sticks with a red tip to bring a morsel of food to her mouth.\n\n\n “Nnn… This taste, it’s really Mom’s food…”\n\n\n Every inch of her mouth was lined with those delicate flavours. Ferdinand had never tasted such good food before, and a wave of emotions washed over him. He felt nostalgia for a mother’s cooking, joy at the prospect of eating it again, grief at the realization that it was all a dream…\n\n\n “It’s delicious, Mom.”\n\n\n “Oh my, you hardly ever praise my food. Is there something you want, like a book?” The woman chuckled. She was eating in front of Myne and she widened her eyes in surprise at her daughter’s praise. Her eyes had the same overflowing, protective love that was there when she was dragging Myne along with her to do arts and crafts.\n\n\n “There are a lot of books I want, but that’s not it. The food just… really is that good.” Myne cleaned her plate, leaving nothing behind.She then clasped her hands again like she was praying\n\n\n She had those eyes filled with so much love and protectiveness, it was the same expression when she forced Myne along to accompany her to make some artcraft.\n\n\n “There are some books I’m interested in, but that’s not it. It’s just that… the food is that good.” Myne cleared everything on her plate such that there was nothing left on it. Her hands came together again.\n\n\n She said with a bowed head as though praying, “Thank you for the food”.\n\n\n Myne finally lifted her head and looked at her mother in the eyes.\n\n\n “I’m sorry, Mum.”\n\n\n Myne’s mother raised her head. Myne looked down again as tears continued rolling out her eyes\n\n\n “I’m sorry for dying before you. I’m sorry for being an idiot that I only noticed how much you loved me after I died. You raised me with so much care. You always let me do what I wanted to do, but I died before I could repay you. I’m sorry.”\n\n\n Myne’s feelings of remorse, shame, and nostalgia pierced Ferdinand hard. Even more so with her overwhelming love for her family. The maelstrom of emotions was unbearable for him, and he cut off their link as it couldn’t take it anymore.\n\n\n For the entire time, Ferdinand had been next to Myne, he stood up and moved backwards by a few steps before falling to his knees, he shook his head.\n\n\n “…I have never felt this awful before .”\n\n\n He had been too deeply in line with Myne. Even he started to cry, despite the fact that the feelings didn’t belong to him. Myne would wake soon as the synchronization had ended. Ferdinand raised his sleeves to wipe his eyes. Myne’s eyes were still closed, but he noticed tears trickling out of her’s too.\n\n\n Myne’s eyelashes trembled before slowly opening. She blinked a few times, she slowly lifted her head and shifted her eyes towards Ferdinand.\n\n\n Myne got up as she used her sleeve to wipe her tears away. Now that Ferdinand was on his knees, she was at his eye level as she sat on the bench. Her golden eyes were still trembling and watery as she gave a pleased smile.\n\n\n “Thank you, High Priest, for showing me my memories… They were getting hazier the longer I lived here.”\n\n\n Her memories that had been so deeply entrenched in her mind had been recovered. This was thanks to the use of mana. It was natural for most people to struggle to recall their memories as they grew only, so it was expected that Myne’s memories would fade too\n\n\n “…I never believed that I would get to eat Mum’s food again, even if it was just in my head, I finally got the chance I thought I would never get to apologise to her. I’m just so, so relieved.”\n\n\n Myne had displayed such gratitude towards him, but Ferdinand couldn’t find a proper reply. He didn’t know what words would be right right now. He could still feel Myne’s flurry of emotions, he was afraid of saying something that wasn’t heartfelt.\n\n\n “Um, did you perhaps feel the same thing I did, because our minds were linked?”\n\n\n “Of course, but you are not at fault. It’s just the work of the magic tool.” Ferdinand gave a sigh.\n\n\n Myne got up on her feet, “High Priest, I’ll give you a big squeeze.”\n\n\n “What? I don’t understand. What is a big squeeze?” Ferdinand froze, he didn’t know what to predict next\n\n\n “This is a big squeeze. Squeeze~~~,” Myne’s voice echoed as she hugged his neck with her arms. “Whenever my dreams get me too emotional, Tuuli calms me with her squueze. I have Lutz and my family, but you don’t have anyone to hug you, right?”\n\n\n Myne’s voice was full of pride. It rang in Ferdinand’s ear and he stiffened in surprise. He could have easily dismissed her and reject her sympathy, but he struggled to do so. He was exhausted from the barrage of emotions. Myne was almost certainly just as fatigued as he was. As she clutched to him, he could hear her hard breathing slow down. After calming down, she sighed and eased her hug around his neck.\n\n\n “High Priest, please use this again in future. There are books I want to read, and Japanese food I want to eat.”\n\n\n “I absolutely refuse. Having to be synced with you is tiring.”\n\n\n This time Ferdinand had no trouble separating from Myne. He got to his feet and removed the magic tool from his head. He had no desire to sync with someone who had such tiring emotions. Myne, on the other hand, refused to take off her magic tool, saying, “I won’t give it back until you promise to do it again,” before kneeling and covering the tool with her hands. This made Ferdinand blink in shock.\n\n\n …Now, how do I go about telling this fool to the Archduke? Her weird infatuation for books is enough to stop her from thinking about anything bad or crimes. She lacks common sense, dignity, and the wariness needed to protect herself. I can’t imagine what she would do if no one watched over her.\n\n\n But she possessed a vast amount of mana, far more than the Archduke, as well as information from a much more advanced world, both aspects are equally priceless. Ehrenfest would prosper if they could fully utilise her like Benno did. The most they could do was to not let anyone take her away. She needed someone to keep an eye on her and make sure she stays on track.\n\n\n “Yes, she needs to be locked up. Books will be bait.”\n\n\n “Oh? So you’ll link with me again?”\n\n\n Is she deliberately misinterpreting me, or is she that detached from reality…? Myne had a bright smile but Ferdinand ripped the circlet from Myne’s head and stared down on her harshly."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Rosina, always keep your emotions hidden. Your smile must always be beautiful, your smiles must never faze. Emotions are only used to elevate your art. Play a sad tune on harspiel whenever you’re feeling down. If something beautiful captures your heart, capture it in a painting. When your soul is touched, you will express yourself with poetry. You must always look poise when you make art,” Sister Christine would constantly repeat this with a calm smile.\n\n\n Sister Christine was an apprentice blue shrine girl. She was here to seek refuge from her father’s first wife, who detested her. She was a late-sleeper, even after I took my time to get dressed and make my hair after the second bell, it was almost impossible to wake her up.\n\n\n “Rosina, what shall we play today?” Wilma looked away from her sleeping master to face me with a troubled smile.\n\n\n The other attendants began suggesting tunes, and I chose the one that Sister Christine probably liked the most and started playing. I alternated between playing the harpsichord and the flute. The instruments I played were determined by my emotions that day. Sister Christine would always wake up after the first song finishes and would smile as she asked for another. The grey shrine maidens would dress her as she listens to the music I play from her requests.\n\n\n She might have to attend lessons with a tutor at the third bell or return to her house in the Noble’s District. I frequently worked with attendants from Sister Christine’s household. While she was occupied, we cleaned her room and made requests to the gray priests on what they needed to restock. Additionally, the gray priests would bring to us the letters and documents that required her signature.\n\n\n It was time for an early bath once the studying and chores were done, and lunch would be between these two. One gray priest would bring her hot water for her bath. After supper, any other visitors they received would be turned away with the excuse that Sister Christine was preparing for her sleep.\n\n\n The time between preparing for sleep and going to bed was the best part of the day with Sister Christine. We kept ourselves entertained with writing poetry, making art, and playing music until Sister Christine got sleepy.\n\n\n “I get enough studying from home and with the tutor. I want my time in the temple to be relaxing. Gray priests are capable of doing the chores themselves. That’s their job.” She said that gray priests were in charge of the chores, while blue priests were in charge of the temple, and blue shrine maidens and their attendants’ jobs were to create art. They only needed to enjoy their lives…\n\n\n “To only see the beautiful, to listen to the beautiful. Refine your creativity. Take a look at this. Is it not beautiful?” Sister Christine would constantly repeat this as she showed us the new and unusual items she had brought back from the Noble’s District. Sheet music of all sorts of tunes, more paint and more parchment for art they could ever wish for, as well as magic tools only for the nobles filled her chambers.\n\n\n …Why doesn’t Sister Myne understand the proper life of an apprentice blue shrine maiden?\n\n\n Sister Myne had been appointed as a temple maiden. She had a pretty face, was cheerful and cute. But her facial expressions changed too sporadically and she didn’t move gracefully and carefully. Her manners were poor and had trouble speaking formally. She had a joy for reading but not for art. She was completely different from Sister Christine. That was why the High Priest asked me to attend Sister Myne. My experience from serving Sister Christine could translate to helping her. My job was to teach Myne, but now I was being told to do chores and chastised for playing the harspiel for reasons unknown.\n\n\n “Rosina, think about your answer by tomorrow morning. Return to the orphanage or accept that serving me will be different than serving Sister Christine, what will you choose? No matter what you say, I’m not going to be Sister Christine for you.”\n\n\n Sister Myne’s words shocked me but still did not understand the predicament I was in. She was definitely serious about making me return to the orphanage if she wanted my answer by tomorrow.\n\n\n Sister Christine instructed me to always smile gracefully to hide my fear in my heart, but my emotions were visible with the haste with which I walked to the orphanage and knocked urgently on Wilma’s door.\n\n\n “Please enter.”\n\n\n When I got inside, I noticed Wilma stopped her paintings on thin boards needed for the karuta to look at me. I lost control and burst into tears the instant I saw her familiar calm smile.\n\n\n “Wilma, listen to me please. You’re the only one who has served Sister Christine with me, only you can understand how I’m feeling now.”\n\n\n Wilma put down her tools and moved her chair to face the bed. I moved and sat on the bed with my body facing her, I started ranting about the attendants bullying. First off, Delia insulted my harspiel playing that it was annoying because she was angry about being illiterate and couldn’t understand art. Gil was another one of them, he always sided with Delia and spoke in the most coarse. Last of which was, Fran who was always forcing me to listen to him.\n\n\n “I lived as what was expected from an attendant of an apprentice blue shrine maiden, they have no experience serving an apprentice maiden but they made no effort to understand me. They don’t see that it is necessary for me to continue playing my music, talk about poetry and make beautiful paintings so Sister Myne can perform her duties as a blue shrine maiden better…”\n\n\n Sister Myne didn’t need to bother herself with paperwork as the High Priest had sufficient assistance from the other blue priests like he did in the past. With regards to the orphanage, Wilma could manage the work there, and Gil and the Gilberta Company could be in charge of matters regarding the workshop and the lower city. Sister Myne did not understand that books or libraries are not needed to lead a proper life, instead she should invest herself into the arts.\n\n\n “Sister Christine always said that life is only enjoyable when you understand and love the beauty from the arts. You do understand that, right Wilma?” I said, but Wilma just scrunched her thin eyebrows, her gaze made me seem like I was a troublesome child.\n\n\n “I understand that dedicating oneself to the arts is enjoyable, but young children like them need sleep over music late at night. I would be bothered if you played your music late into the night when the children are trying to sleep in the orphanage.”\n\n\n I blinked in surprise, I did not expect Wilma to refute me.\n\n\n But why? I was in so much confusion.\n\n\n Wilma placed a hand on her cheek. “Sister Christine wakes up late, but not in Sister Myne’s chambers. Everyone there wakes up as early as we do in the orphanage, right?”\n\n\n I lowered my eyes, my thoughts ran back to how Delia would always knock at my door early in the morning to wake me up. It’s not proper to be walking around that early in the morning, but everyone always insisted that “We always wake up at this time in the temple”.\n\n\n “Did Fran say anything about this? I’m sure that being a former attendant to the High Priest, he will always keep a neutral stance, unlike the children there.”\n\n\n “Fran and Sister Myne’s trust in each other is mutual, but he is completely clueless how a blue shrine maiden and her attendants should act. He is a gray priest but he does not listen to me at all. Thinking about it, he even ordered me to do chores when he himself does not do the manual chores he is supposed to do. What an annoying man.”\n\n\n It was bonkers that an attendant priest would dare order around an attendant maiden. The former’s duty was to do the manual chores while the latter supports her master with her artistic talents. Even so, Wilma seemed to be surprised at this.\n\n\n “Is it not a given that Fran gives you orders, Rosina? He is Sister Myne’s head attendant, while you are an apprentice attendant who just began serving her.”\n\n\n “Rosina, what part of Fran giving you orders is not right? He is Sister Myne’s head attendant, you are only an attendant who just started out.”\n\n\n “But the harspiel…” I started to protest, but Wilma slowly shaking her head made me stop.\n\n\n “Rosina, you have to understand that Sister Myne and Sister Christine are not the same person. You cannot harbour the same expectations on how Sister Myne should treat you.”\n\n\n “…To think you would say the same thing as Sister Myne, Wilma,” I murmured in shock.\n\n\n Wilma sighed. “May I ask what else Sister Myne said?”\n\n\n “She told me to stop playing the harpiel after the seventh bell so that I do not disturb the others at night. She understood how much I treasured my hands for playing instruments, so she suggested that I assist her in writing rather than do the chores. Lastly, she asked me to assist Fran in looking through the financial documents of her place, the workshop and orphanage to help lessen his workload.”\n\n\n All attendants knew how to read and do math, so I was able to help Fran. But work of that sort was entrusted to the gray priests. All the gray shrine maiden under Sister Christine busied themselves with painting and poetry, so I had no clue on handling business affairs. I was lacking in the math sector, so I doubt I could provide much assistance. I was just an attendant who did her job in the arts.\n\n\n “If she hopes to lessen Fran’s workload, why not hire more attendants?”\n\n\n “Sister Christine was a noble, but Sister Myne is not. She is a commoner, thereby she lacks sufficient money to care for ten or more attendants. Truthfully speaking, she is the sort of person who would teach the children in the orphanage to work for their fill if they wanted food.”\n\n\n I was slightly dumbfounded by what Wilma said. I could never fathom the idea that an apprentice blue shrine maiden did not have sufficient funds to hire more attendants. Weren’t blue shrine maidens all about being able to get whatever they wanted?\n\n\n “But even if she is a commoner, she is still a blue shrine maiden. How is it that…”\n\n\n “The blue priests in the temple have five attendants, do they not? Sister Christine was just an exception.”\n\n\n Sister Christine had two attendants that accompanied her from her household, six gray shrine maidens that did art with her, and the remaining four gray priests were in charge of all the heavy work and chores. There were also multiple chefs, assistants and tutors to assist her for everything. I did not know that that was not the typical standard here.\n\n\n Sister Myne was a commoner, she and Sister Christine were completely different. I always assumed that her way of life was because she came from a different place. I believed that my job was to help her live a life like Sister Christine. It never occurred to me funds would impact them.\n\n\n Wilma just looked at me with her lively brown eyes in silence, she sighed again, “Rosina, honey. Do you think that you lack the skills to serve Sister Myne?”\n\n\n “…She asked me for an answer by tomorrow. To choose between returning to the orphanage or to accept that I will not receive the same treatment I did from Sister Christine”\n\n\n “I see. Rosina, you will have to make the final call. I believe that Sister Myne will try her best to make it comfortable for you. If you cannot see yourself serving a master who has taken their time to accommodate your needs, I believe that you will struggle to serve anyone else except Sister Christine. If that is so, before you stir up more problems, it would be best for you to return to the orphanage before.”\n\n\n Wilma’s words hurt me. She served Sister Christine with me so I did not expect her to be this harsh.\n\n\n “Wilma… Don’t you think it is wrong for a shrine maiden to do the work of a priest?”\n\n\n “No, I do not. It is the norm for shrine maidens to do the chores and work in the temple, only Sister Christine’s attendants had it different. If you had to serve other blue priests as an attendant, you would not get an instrument at all. Worst of all, you might have been made to give flowers. Do you still find serving Sister Myne unpleasant after considering all these?”\n\n\n It was impossible for a gray shrine maiden to argue with a blue priest for an instrument, or for her to not offer flowers because she was educated. She would just be completely ignored. In actuality, there would be no room for negotiation as they would not allow any disagreement to happen.\n\n\n …I knew that attendants were specifically trained to suit the needs of their masters, but I never took the effort to fully understand why. I just did the minimum so that I could serve a blue priest without having to go through any hardships, but it seems that I was naive.\n\n\n I slowly shut my eyes as tears ran down my face. I tried to leave my current master Sister Myne because I kept reminiscing about my life with Sister Christine. I was so infatuated with turning her into a master I wanted, completely ignorant that it was me who needed to change.\n\n\n Sister Myne did not need what Sister Christine did from her attendants. It was such an obvious fact but I had been too stubborn to acknowledge it. No matter who I served, I kept trying to reject everything because I could not accept that idea that I could not go back to the past.\n\n\n With my eyes still shut, I recalled all the times spent with Sister Christine. The strumming of harspiels. The music we played. Those peaceful times when lovely laughter filled the room as everyone engrossed themselves with the arts. That was probably the best and most fulfilling moment of my life.\n\n\n After Sister Christine returned home, I was sent back to the orphanage, and I remembered how depressed I was there. I was heartbroken about not having enough instruments, the miniscule amount of food, and my damaged hands from all the manual work. Every day, I imagined myself playing the harspiel, pretending there was music in my dim life that was deprived of anything beautiful. I prayed so badly to be able to serve a blue shrine maiden again.\n\n\n …Should I learn how to do chores under Sister Myne or go back to the orphanage without a harspiel? My doubts were answered the moment I recalled how happy I had been after playing the harpiel again. The instrument’s comforting weight made me relieved and the touch of strings made me break into a smile, being able to play music again was such a blessing that I was on the verge of crying. I would choose chores over giving up a life devoid of music again.\n\n\n “Wilma, I want to fill my life with as much music as possible. So I have decided to continue serving Sister Myne. I will learn to work.”\n\n\n “Sister Myne will be glad to hear that you will do your best, just as she had been when she rewarded those in the orphanage who worked their hardest. I could not do much but listen to your worries, but I sincerely wish you the best.”\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n Since that day, I have been studying to complete paperwork as Sister Myne’s attendant whilst overcoming my apprehensions about math. Instead of continuing to wish to be Sister Christine’s attendant again, I would do my best under Sister Myne.\n\n\n The first thing I discovered was that Sister Myne excelled at paperwork. Although she was so young, she was far superior to me in mathematics and far more helpful to Fran than me. The paperwork would be easier with Sister Myne around, but she was busy with the religious work, as well as her education and training as an apprentice blue shrine maiden. Fran told me to do my best so that Sister Myne could rest more.\n\n\n “Rosina, please hand these to Wilma.”\n\n\n “Understood.”\n\n\n Sister Myne was not used to disguising her feelings and reading other people’s faces. But Fran was not like her, he could see through me and noticed whenever I was getting tired from work. During such occasions, he gave me a break by sending me on errands to the orphanage or the workshop, or by educating Sister Myne on the gods.\n\n\n I put the pen and ink aside and made my way to the orphanage. It was my first visit to the orphanage since deciding to dedicate myself to becoming Sister Myne’s attendant. I owe Wilma a huge debt for encouraging me to change my own mindset rather than attempting to change Sister Myne’s.\n\n\n “Is Wilma here?” I asked Lizzie, who stood by the orphanage door. She gestured into the dining hall and said that she was looking after the children who were eating.\n\n\n Those in blue robes, such as Sister Myne, ate first, followed by their attendants. The food was passed to the orphanage, where it was distributed according to status: first the adults, then the baptized children, and finally the pre-baptized ones. As a result, the youngest kids were the last to eat. Although it had been a long time since I had eaten, it appeared that the children just got their share of food. Wilma sat at the back with six other children.\n\n\n “Has everyone finished their meal? Now then, let us give our thanks and praises to the gods for their blessings. I offer thanks and prayers to thee, O mighty King and Queen of the eternal sky who have graced us with thousands and thousands of lives for sustenance, thee O mighty Immortal Five who look over the mortal realm, I shall grateful partake in this blessed meal,” Wilma chanted, and the young children repeated after her before digging into their food.\n\n\n They all wolfed down their food, most likely because they were hungry. Wilma already had her fill, so she spent her time teaching them proper table manners and cleaning up their mess, but it appeared that looking after six children was too much on her plate.\n\n\n “Food is always so good now. One of the children exclaimed, “I like this soup.”\n\n\n “The vegetables are so evenly cut, Lizzie must have been the one cooking, right?” said another child.\n\n\n “We get to enjoy this soup now because Sister Myne taught us the recipe. She also taught us to go to the forest to get our own food. We also get to buy the rest of the stuff we need from selling the paper she taught us to make.”\n\n\n “Wilma, you keep repeating that. I’ll finish your words. ‘You all need to thank Sister Myne,’ right?” giggled the child who spoke first.\n\n\n Sister Myne was responsible for allowing the pre-baptism youngsters to dine together in the dining hall rather than being confined to the cellar. She was also the one who provided all these bowls of soup on the tables on days with little divine gifts.\n\n\n Sister Christine never cared for the orphanage. If she had seen the starved children in the cellar, she would have probably wrinkled her nose and walked away. She wouldn’t spare an extra second to look at anything ugly. She would never have considered helping them. Even if she had the intentions to do so she wouldn’t see it in the end.\n\n\n Ever since I started changing my mindset, I saw all these good points about Sister Myne I failed to see before. I used to think that her being attached to the lower city, manning the workshop and having plans to help the orphanage were just obstructions to her lessons. Little did I realise that the orphanage and I had been saved by them.\n\n\n Wilma saw me and got up to speak to me. “Oh, Rosina. How are things now?”\n\n\n I smiled and passed her the boards from Fran.\n\n\n “I have been busy studying all that math I used to despise so much. Also… Sister Myne said that she admired the way I poised myself with my words and actions, she also mentioned that she wishes to do her best to act like me. Did you ask her to say that, Wilma?”\n\n\n “I only mentioned that you were the attendant that tended to Sister Myne the most and that you were the best role model to learn from.”\n\n\n One of the strengths Myne had was her humility to ask to be taught the things she was unfamiliar with. But I was always too reluctant to ask Fran questions…\n\n\n “Wilma, I have started to believe that working to overcome my shortcomings is a good thing, and I have found myself some little joys in the orphanage director’s chambers.”\n\n\n “Oh my. What little joys?”\n\n\n “Maybe because Sister Myne is a commoner, she knows so many lyrics and music I have never heard before.”\n\n\n Sister Myne would occasionally sing a tune I had never heard before while bobbing her head to the beat. She frequently hummed or sang quietly, which made the song difficult to understand. But, much to Fran’s chagrin, whenever I heard the music, I would subconsciously stop my work to listen to it.\n\n\n “Additionally, Delia might be interested in harspiels. I have seen her looking at me whenever I play.” I had till the seventh bell to play music, but Delia has been accompanying me before bed to play music. I found it repulsive that she aspired to be a concubine. But according to Myne, Delia was a dedicated attendant that always strives to do better, even though I still question the purpose of her improvement.\n\n\n “I see. I am happy to know that things are going well for you. Rosina, I think your commitment to overcoming your weaknesses is admirable.’ Wilma laughed and remarked, “I’m sure Sister Christine would strive to keep your dedication to the arts.” My efforts would not be immortalized in art, but they would be in Sister Myne’s paperwork.\n\n\n “I’m sorry for all the trouble, Wilma. I think I will be fine now.”"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n As everyone in the orphanage had left to butcher the pigs, Hugo and I stayed behind to teach Monika and Nicole how to cook. These two new apprentice gray shrine maidens would assist us over the winter.\n\n\n Nicola had braided her large volume of orange hair, they shined so brightly that they seemed to glow red. She enjoyed cooking and looked really cute because she always smiled whenever she worked. Conversely, Monika was an introverted and serious girl who always tied her dark green hair. I was putting lots of attention in teaching them as they would help me throughout the winter with Hugo gone. They both learned fast.\n\n\n During lunch with Nicole, Monika, Hugo and the new chef Todd, Nicole asked me, “Ella, why did you decide to become a temple chef?”\n\n\n “Ella, why did you want to be a chef in the temple?” she asked.\n\n\n Hugo looked away because he knew my circumstances, while Todd leaned in with curiosity, but Monika just looked down on the table.\n\n\n “People from the lower city don’t have a good impression of the temple, right? It’s pretty noticeable when walking to the forest. But you still chose to come to the temple. You don’t even mind teaching us to cook. I find it really perplexing,” she continued speaking. My thoughts travelled to my meeting with Benno who caused all this.\n\n\n …Wow, he looks really rich.\n\n\n My uncle had made me make a trip to the Dining Guild to request for an extension on our tax payments. I noticed a man sitting in the most prestigious seat in the guild. His clothes were a class above those normally seen in the Dining Guild. I continued staring at him and was curious why someone as rich as him was here. I strained my ears to hear what he was discussing with one of the guild members…\n\n\n “Have you found anyone to be Hugo’s assistant?”\n\n\n “Hmm… I know this job is too hard for Hugo alone, but as I’ve mentioned before, Benno, nobody wants to take this job.”\n\n\n From their conversation, it seems that the rich man was Benno and he was here to hire an assistant chef. My heart gave a thump. My fists tightened as I felt the blood coursing through my blood burning up with excitement… Was this a blessing from Cuokokalura, the God of Cooking?!\n\n\n “Ella, I said this before, we can’t wait this long… Hey, are you even listening?” I zoned out when talking to the guild member in front of me.\n\n\n I turned back at him in surprise. He had slipped off my mind momentarily. I pointed at Benno and whispered in an urgent voice, “Hey, is that rich-looking man looking for a chef?!”\n\n\n “Huh?… Oh, Mr Benno. He’s hiring a chef for the restaurant he’s planning to build. But he’s not looking for just any chef, he wants them to be trained in the temple to cook for the nobles.”\n\n\n “…Wait, did you say the temple?”\n\n\n Everyone wanted to avoid anything to do with the temple unless it was absolutely unavoidable. No one knew what the consequences would be if you offended a noble. Anyone from the temple orphanage was treated like slaves by the nobles. People have said that the nobles could easily kill anyone without repercussions, and that the girls there had to sleep with them.\n\n\n …What’s the difference from being a waitress? I worked as an apprentice chef at my uncle’s bar during the night. I was helping out in the kitchen for now, but when I came of age I would be a waitress. My cousin Lea, who was uncle’s daughter, also became a waitress when she came of age, so I expected the same. The men in the bar would harass and catcall me, some had paid my uncle so he would make me serve them in their rooms.\n\n\n Even though I hated the job, I couldn’t run away from my fate as it was the family business. I had to choose between a high-risk job assisting a noble’s chef or to save sufficient funds for my own store before I came of age. I strived to be like Leise, she excelled at being a noble’s chef that she was now the head chef for the Merchant’s Guild. There was a possibility I could be like her if I trained in the temple to cook for the nobles.\n\n\n “Excuse me, sir. Do the temple chefs work as waitresses too?” I asked Benno from a distance. His deep red eyes look at me in surprise. His expression quickly changed from that of a stunned one to a frown, his sharp eyes locked into mine.\n\n\n “…No, they don’t work as waitresses. The apprentice shrine maidens are served by their attendants. You only have to work for just one shrine maiden and they don’t want that service. Honestly, they don’t want commoners speaking to them.”\n\n\n This was beyond my wildest dreams, to serve a rice noble girl as an apprentice chef and I didn’t need to work as a waitress.\n\n\n “I’m only an apprentice chef, but I would love to help out. I’m pretty confident in my skills.” I slapped my arm with a large grin.\n\n\n Benno turned back to the guild member and pointed at me, “How good is she?”\n\n\n “Ella has nailed her basics, you probably want someone better skilled to cook for a noble but she would be capable enough to be Hugo’s assistant. She aspires to be a noble’s chef, I can assure you that she has all the motivation and spirit needed.”\n\n\n “Hm…” Benno thought deeply as he looked at me.\n\n\n The guild member who was with me yelled in a serious tone. “Wait, Benno! It’s already a thing to hire a man for the temple, but a lady? It would be nearly impossible for her to get married. Ella, please reconsider this with your own future in mind. Don’t be so impulsive to jump at any opportunity that comes at you, you’ll just be played like a fool!”\n\n\n I bit on my lips in response. I wasn’t dumb, I was very well aware of my actions. I didn’t want to be a waitress, even if it was for the family business. I wanted a different future.\n\n\n “My uncle will force me to be a waitress when I come of age. I don’t expect the temple to be any different. And he mentioned that the employer is a blue shrine maiden, so she must be a rich noble girl. I have always dreamed of being a noble’s chef if I ever left my uncle’s store. There’s no problem working in the temple for that dream.”\n\n\n I said my piece as Benno looked on. He nodded to show his approval of my determination.\n\n\n “…Fine. I’ll hire you.”\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n “My uncle was strongly against it, but Mum was very supportive. Mum had to work as a waitress after Dad died, even though she was so reluctant to. Now she is just glad that I’ve found a new opportunity in life…”\n\n\n “Oh, so waitresses had to do something like how we offer flowers here. Well, we can’t refuse a blue priest if he asks for flowers, I can relate to you when you said that you wanted another path in life,” replied Nicola.\n\n\n “One of the reasons why we cook here is so that we can get closer to Sister Myne. We hope that one day she will ask us to be her attendant.” Monika continued on.\n\n\n So it was true that the gray shrine maidens from the orphanage were made to work like waitresses here. Now I understand why Nicola and Monika were trying so hard to improve themselves to avoid ever having to offer flowers.\n\n\n “That person you called, “Mum”, sounds awfully kind,” Nicola praised and Monika agreed with a grin. I had to fight the impulse to laugh and explain their misunderstandings because they seemed earnest. I had no idea how to describe families to them because the idea of families were so familiar for me and everyone else I knew. I could only brush off their words with a smile and continued speaking.\n\n\n “I’m not of age yet, so I can’t change my workplace without Mum’s consent. She accompanied me to the Dining Guild to sign the contract with the Gilberta Company. I also met Hugo that day too.” Nicole and Monika looked at Hugo who smiled back.\n\n\n “I never would have imagined I’d work with another person who had yet to come of age like Ellla. I was so surprised when I saw her.”\n\n\n “I was so happy to know that you were a nice person, Hugo.”\n\n\n Hugo was now my colleague and teacher. He looked very friendly because of his chestnut coloured hair and brown eyes.\n\n\n “I’m always being seen as just the nice guy because of my looks!” Hugo ranted, saying that it was because of that he couldn’t find a girlfriend. But Nicola and Monika just looked surprised.\n\n\n “Is being a good person a bad thing? Or is it a troublesome thing?”\n\n\n “Can’t say the same for me,” I laughed while looking at Hugo.\n\n\n “And the both of you don’t have to worry about it too.” Hugo had broad shoulders and buff arms, most chefs looked like this because of all they heavy lifting they had to do. He had calluses in his hand because he handled the knife for a while. On our handshake during the first meeting, I noticed he had calluses like me too.\n\n\n I saw that he was looking at my hands too. I smiled back and so did he.\n\n\n He said this back then, “Not bad. You have my approval for now.”\n\n\n … That sounded pretty cool. He had such a cool expression when he said that, and he also looked cool whenever he worked. When he was cooking, he always looked so serious and refined. A guy who had a job and performed it well had a certain coolness about him. He most likely didn’t have a girlfriend because he had no female coworkers at the restaurant he worked at.\n\n\n “I signed with the Gilberta Company to avoid becoming a waitress. But ever since I’ve worked at the temple, I’ve been constantly surprised by everything. Isn’t that right, Hugo?”\n\n\n “Yea. Though I’m used to it now, those first few days were insane. This place is worlds away from the city,” said Hugo, and Todd nodded along.\n\n\n “I still get surprised everyday. My hands get covered in sweat and tremble so much at the thought that a noble might see me. It gets so hard to work.”\n\n\n “Todd, that sounds bad. You need to learn how to relax sometimes.”\n\n\n My life as a temple apprentice chef was nothing like my usual life. I didn’t expect to be taught about cleaning my hands, personal cleanliness, and general hygiene before learning more about cooking. Hugo and I had glanced at each other with shocked eyes before processing the idea that we had to clean ourselves before visiting the orphanage director chambers.\n\n\n Fran first instructed us that, “You will be expected to maintain a high level of hygiene.”\n\n\n “The Italian restaurant that Sister Myne is planning to open will demand the same level of cleanliness, so the sooner you get used to it, the better. At your current state, I cannot allow you to meet Myne and start your job.”\n\n\n “Hugo, Ella. This is Fran, he is the head attendant of the shrine maiden you will be serving,” explained Benno. “You will heed his every instruction. Fran, I will wait in the room. Please do me a good job and teach these two the rules in the temple.”\n\n\n After that, Benno went into the room first, leaving us with Fran. Even after we started working at the Italian restaurant, it appeared that we would keep in touch with Sister Myne. We had no choice but to clean ourselves.\n\n\n Fran brought us to a well. First off, he gave us a thorough examination, then he made us wash our hands and faces repeatedly. He was so nit-picky that I honestly wanted to point out how wasteful he was being for making us waste that much soap. Despite the fact that we had both showered the night before because Benno insisted that we needed to be clean when meeting the apprentice blue shrine maiden (because she was a noble), Fran seemed dissatisfied at everything. I did not want to imagine what would unfold if we did not try to clean ourselves before\n\n\n “Please take a bath the night before you go to the temple.”\n\n\n “Huh? Wait, so we have to bathe every day? I asked. Hugo muttered a soft “Seriously?” next to me. I was shocked too. We could get by in the summer because we could just haul the water over us, but in the winter we would have to build a fire first to heat the water over. Hugo and I shuddered at the thought, but Fran nodded as if it that was expected from everyone.\n\n\n “Sister Myne is very particular about hygiene when it comes to cooking. Furthermore, you will come across other noble blue robes, so you must always look clean before you come to work. This applies to everyone else in the temple, even for priests and shrine maidens in the orphanage who aren’t attendants.”\n\n\n …So to say, this Fran person showers everyday. That’s supposed to be normal here? Aaah…\n\n\n After we were clean to his standards, Fran nodded and escorted us to the hall where Benno was waiting to introduce us to our new master, Sister Myne. He then ascended the stairwell to her personal room on the second floor.\n\n\n After Fran left, I moved over to Benno.\n\n\n “Benno, what’s going on? He said that everyone in the temple cleans themselves and their clothes everyday. Do we really have to do that too? That would be excessive,” I resisted this fact. Benno’s eyes widened in surprise, but Hugo continued on.\n\n\n “I agree with Ella. It’s impossible to tell if our clothes will dry by the next morning. The one set of uniform you provided isn’t enough for this.”\n\n\n Hugo worked at a typical lower-city restaurant, so he was not affluent and I didn’t have sufficient clothes needed to work in the temple. I felt a bond with Hugo about our predicament, and I complained to Benno that cleaning clothing every day would be outrageous because we didn’t have any servants to help us like he did.\n\n\n “Yea, Lutz said the same too. Fine, I’ll sell you some cheap clothes.”\n\n\n “Whew, thank you.”\n\n\n “Oh. Shush, Ella. Sister Myne is here,” Hugo warned me. I quickly shut up and glanced at the stairs to see a small girl in blue robes descend the stairs with poise. So that was Sister Myne.\n\n\n Wow! An actual noble girl! This is my first time meeting Sister Myne. She’s such a cute girl. Her dark-blue hair looks like the night sky, it was silky straight and swishes nicely behind her, it was totally different from my messy curls. Her nose, eyes and mouth gave her a small, pretty and cute face.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, this is Hugo, the Gilberta Company’s chef. Ella is his assistant. Hugo, you’ll learn how to cook like a nobleman here. Pay attention and study hard.” Benno spoke politely. His polite demeanor made it evident how that Sister Myne was of noble status…\n\n\n “I shall guide you to the kitchen, “Fran said, and we were guided to our new workspace.\n\n\n …Amazing! It was a large kitchen that had all the tools one could ever need. There was even a huge furnace oven that you only see in bakeries. I needed to master all these tools if I wanted to get hired at the restaurant Benno was preparing. This place was the best place for us to cultivate our skills.\n\n\n The kitchen was sparkling clean, it was completely different from my uncle’s store. Hugo seemed excited by this too. A kitchen like this could not be found anywhere in the lower city. It was true that nobles live in another world from commoners. But everything will change for me from this moment, my work will now be as amazing as this kitchen.\n\n\n “As I’ve mentioned, you must understand the importance of practicing good hygiene. Always keep your utensils and dishes clean. The kitchen must always look the way it is now.”\n\n\n Fran was now our instructor. He held up the wood board and repeated the words Myne instructed us. He was an orphan and a gray priest here, but he was literate as he could read the words on the board. His way of speaking was so polite and graceful that I was beyond impressed. I could immediately tell that he had a proper education and was thoroughly trained. He was acting beyond my expectations of what I heard about orphans from the city\n\n\n But we continued to be surprised. The instructions he gave us continued on, each of them were equally shocking. He told us to wash our hands often when cooking, the recipes had lots of prep work and the order in which the food was made had to be strictly followed\n\n\n “You will use the broth to cook the food. Do not throw out the water after boiling the vegetables.”\n\n\n “We’re not to toss out the water?” The idea that we were not to pour out the water after using it to boil the vegetables seemed like a bad idea. All the soil and first would contaminate the water, it was a common fact that boiled water causes miscarriage or made you infertile.\n\n\n I glanced at Benno and he nodded back. I recalled him instructing us to follow Fran’s every order, so I held back my distaste at this and continued cooking.\n\n\n However, when I tasted the soup with a bowl, I never had something like this before. The vegetables’ flavor was stronger and the tiny amount of salt enhanced its sweetness. It created a balance of delicate flavors that wafted throughout my entire body.\n\n\n My eyes glistened, and it felt as I discovered a new realm to cooking and this shone an amazing light onto me. I could feel my universe growing, and I couldn’t control myself even though Sister Myne was still present.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n “I’ll never forget how surprised I was the first time I drank the soup for nobles. It’s a pain to make, but it tastes amazing. It was absolutely out of this world.”\n\n\n “Oh? But the soup we cook here isn’t the same as what nobles have,” Monika said in bewilderment and looked at Nicola who nodded in agreement.\n\n\n “Out of all the food we’ve received from the nobles as divine gifts, the soup here is the tastiest.”\n\n\n Hugo, Todd and I all exchanged looks of surprise. We all assumed that the recipes were weird because they were for nobles, but it appears that it was only because they were made by Sister Myne.\n\n\n “So it’s only Sister Myne’s food? Not just her soup, but all the others are like this too…? No wonder Benno made us sign the contract that we could not make these food outside from the temple without his or Sister Myne’s approval. These recipes must be a big deal” I thought.\n\n\n “Urgh, this sucks. I didn’t need to know about this big secret now,” Todd replied as she shivered from fear, he was terrified at the thought that he was now connected to and knew about some important secret.\n\n\n But Hugo just gave an amused grin. “Ha. Food that not even nobles know? This is getting more interesting.”\n\n\n His confidence was such an inspiration to me. I placed my hands on my hip and puffed up with pride. “Hugo, glad to see that you’re this excited, but I’m the one who will learn all of Sister Myne’s recipes.”\n\n\n Hugo was bewildered by my remark and I continued on with a proud expression, “Well, I’m going to be living here throughout winter, so I’ll be doing all the cooking. She’ll definitely teach me new recipes. We’re going to give our best, Nicola and Monika. You two need to become Sister Myne’s attendant, and I’m going to beat Hugo.”\n\n\n “Yea!” Nicole and Monika gave a heated response, they exchanged smiles and I looked at Hugo.\n\n\n “Oh, I have no issues teaching you the new recipes during spring. Of course, if you’re nice about it.” Everyone started laughing but Hugo was disappointed and sighed.\n\n\n ~~\n\n\n …I’ll get to cook lots of dishes this winter, learn new recipes, and finally overtake Hugo!\n\n\n Autumn was ending and everyone was preparing for winter, but I was motivated with a new goal in sight.\n\n\n Back then, I was still clueless as to why I was so fixated on Hugo and so obsessed with trying to catch up to him."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n I was playing reversi with the High Priest (who finished his paperwork early today). He suddenly pushed a sound-blocking magic tool towards me. I stretched my arm to grab it while he placed his black piece on the playing board.\n\n\n “Myne, the Dedication Ritual will start on the next Earthday.”\n\n\n “Right.”\n\n\n I kept staring at the black piece he placed on the board, pondering my next move when I heard Ferdinand whispered under his breath.\n\n\n “…Make a bad move.”\n\n\n I looked back up at him, confused at what he meant then. He warned me to not look away, that I did not need to put my shocked expression on display.\n\n\n “I told the High Bishop that typically, you will only have seven to eight stones worth of mana left after offering twelve stones worth of mana. He will believe that twenty is your limit before you pass out. But of course, you have much more than that…” His words trailed off as he reached for another reversi stone. We were using square wooden blocks with one side painted black as reversi stones. He never broke his line of sight from the board.\n\n\n “If you show him your full capability by accident, he will probably think that we had lied to him or that we were trying to hide your powers. So it would be to our advantage that you hold back to filling a maximum of twenty stones everyday for the Dedication Ritual. It would be better if you feign weakness after that.”\n\n\n “I have no problems with that, but wouldn’t it mean we were actually deceiving him?”\n\n\n It was not a big deal for me to control my mana, but then it would make High Bishop’s misunderstanding true that we were truly deceiving him. However, my comment only made the High Priest smirk.\n\n\n “It will not be considered a misunderstanding if we had actually lied to him, right? I also dislike it when people lie to me, but we can always disprove his claims by saying that we truly did deceive him. Of course, it will always be better for us to take a precaution by making you hide your full powers. It would be foolish of us to reveal everything to him. To defeat your enemies, you cannot reveal all your tricks, and in this case, you cannot reveal all your powers.”\n\n\n “I see…”\n\n\n I got High Priest’s point, but my imagination went straight to the scene of High Bishop yelling “You deceived me!” and the High Priest responding with a “Yes we did”.\n\n\n …Yup, High Priest is a bad guy…\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n On the Earthday that the Dedication Ritual began. Delia woke me up early in the morning for a bath and cleaned me up. Then, she helped dress me in my ceremonial robes. The blue robes had embroidery of blue thread that resembled waves and flowers, it had gold threading at the sleeves and was finished with a silver cloth around the waist. There were smaller red decorations, red represented winter religiously. The colour symbolised a hopeful life that weakened the cold.\n\n\n “Delia, I will be using the new hairpin today.”\n\n\n I stopped Delia from taking the old hairpin from the closet and took out a cloth from my table drawer and handed it to her. Tuuli jad brought over a few days ago\n\n\n “Hey! You can’t leave the hairpins in your drawer! Who knows if you’ll mess up all the flowers?!”\n\n\n Delia shook her head as she carefully took out the hairpin. The hairpin had the same design as the one I wore at my baptism ceremony, but this time it used red and green thread that would suit the winter and spring rituals. It had three large red flowers and a long strand decorated with many small green leaves, it used the same concept I did for the small white flowers.\n\n\n My family made me a new hairpin for temple work after seeing how sad I had been after my other one was ruined from the time I worked with the Knight Order. This would comfort me over my lonely winter in the temple.\n\n\n “The hairpin looks really good on you, but the other went well with your hair colour, Sister Myne.” said Rosin who was standing from a distance. She twinged with some regret after I had tied up my hair with the new hairpin.\n\n\n “Unfortunately, there’s nothing to be done about it. I made a request to use the symbolic colours for the upcoming winter and spring rituals, so we can’t do anything about it not matching my hair colour.”\n\n\n After my hair was done, I waited for Damuel to walk me to the High Priest’s room.\n\n\n The High Priest’s attendants had a difficult time summoning me because my room was the only one this far away from the nobles’ area of the temple. He urged me to wait in his room before the ceremony to save time.\n\n\n My robes were made of the finest fabric available, it provided much warmth and was light, it made a very satisfying swishing sound everytime I moved.\n\n\n “Those clothes definitely look like the insane price they cost,” said Damual in amazement as he looked at my robes, he was definitely thinking about the money he spent just to cover a quarter of its price.\n\n\n It was different from my first set that was made from available cloth, this one had been made from scratch that was more expensive. I was curious and asked Damuel how much he had spent, and they had cost triple of the first one I had bought.\n\n\n Damuel was from a laynoble family that was not very affluent, they were not much better than commoners. It turns out he had passed out when he found out the amount he had to pay. He tried asking his family for help, so in the end it was his older brother’s concubine who ended up bearing most of the cost.\n\n\n “I heard that you paid for your first set, apprentice. I’m impressed that you have that much money.”\n\n\n “They were made out of the cloth someone gave me, so it’s not as expensive as you think it is.”\n\n\n “I see, but even so…”\n\n\n We finished our conversation when we arrived at the High Priest’s chambers. The High Priest was absent because he had to attend the ritual, but he left behind some attendants to tend to me.\n\n\n “Good morning, Sister Myne. Arno will come over after the other blue priests are done with the ritual. Please make yourself comfortable until then.”\n\n\n I had to fast until the ritual was over, so there was nothing for me to do but wait. I sat in the chair offered to me while Fran and Damuel stood behind me. It felt kind of weird that Damuel who was a noble, was standing while I sat. I turned my head to ask him.\n\n\n “Are you not going to sit down, Sir Damuel?”\n\n\n “Apprentice, a bodyguard cannot seat as he would be unable to move fast enough when needed. An emergency could pop up any time.” His serious tone made it definitive that he was not going to change his mind, so I had no choice but to keep seated, even though it felt so uncomfortable.\n\n\n I waited quietly, and Arno did come for me.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, please follow me now,” he said.\n\n\n I got up to follow him, along with Fran and Damual who tagged along behind. We left the High Priest’s room, we walked past several other doors then the High Bishop’s room before we turned a corner. Arno walked faster than my attendants who usually slowed down to match my pace.\n\n\n Fran noticed I was struggling to keep up and he called out to Arno.\n\n\n “Apologies, Arno, may I request that you slow down?”\n\n\n “Oh, I see. I was walking too fast for Sister Myne,” he said before slowing his steps. “I’m sorry.”\n\n\n A gray priest slowly opened the door at the end of the hallway as we moved towards it. Seeing that he was looking inside the room, he probably was not opening it for me, but for those inside heading out.\n\n\n The first person that emerged was a large man dressed in white robes with a golden ribbon around his waist. Those robes looked familiar, there was only one man who could wear them, so I recognized him instantly.\n\n\n “…High Bishop.” I bluttered his title without a second thought. I almost forgot about him since it had been a while since I last saw him after entering the temple, but there was no doubt he still saw me as an enemy. His face grimaced with disgust when he looked at me and he approached us with that crude face.\n\n\n This was the worst coincidence, his room was behind us so he would return there now. If we delayed our departure from the High Priest’s chambers, we would not have to cross paths as The High Bishop would have retreated to his chambers.\n\n\n I stepped aside, knelt down and placed my arms across my chest. Arno, Fran and Damuel followed along. I heard High Bishop’s footsteps and swishing of his robes approaching me. I filled with dread because I knew he despised me and might do something to me. My heart was pacing around as I quietly waited for him to pass by.\n\n\n I kept my eyes on the floor and soon I saw his white robes pass me. I was thankful that he only let out an arrogant snort before moving on. I kept my knees to the ground and my head down until I heard his door shut. I gave a relieved sigh and got up.\n\n\n Arno continued guiding me to the ritual hall door that was still open.\n\n\n “Sir Damuel, please wait here. Only priests and shrine maidens are allowed into the ritual hall.” I turned around when Arno spoke, but he gestured me to head in, signaling that the High Priest was waiting inside.\n\n\n And as expected, when I walked in, I saw the High Priest alone in the room standing in front of the altar.\n\n\n The ritual hall looked like a small chapel. It’s ceiling was taller and wider than the High Priest’s room. The walls were painted white with gold-plated ornaments fixed at equal distances. The walls had white pillars with gold pieces engraved at the top like that of the chapel. Between each pillar were windows and there were metal torches set alite\n\n\n On the wall at the other side of the room, there was an abstract wall decorated with striking art in bright colours. In front of the wall was an altar with different levels, with torches on both sides. A long red cloth that looked like carpets was laid down the centre of the hall and it continued up and over the altar. On top of the altar were various divine objects but there was not a single statue of the gods.\n\n\n The top of the altar was the King and Queen of gods, along with the Light Goddess crown on the Dark God’s cape. At the centre of the step beneath it was a huge gold chalice surrounded by several smaller ones on. The small chalices were returned from the farming towns by the blue priests during the Harvest Festival, they needed to be filled with mana during the Dedication Ritual. They would be returned after winter during the Spring Prayer. On the next level was the divine staff, spear, shield and sword.\n\n\n The last step had an array of offerings to the gods - plants that symbolised the coming of spring, fruits that celebrated a plenty harvest, incense that welcomed peaceful times, and cloths that displayed their dedicated faith in them.\n\n\n “You arrived sooner than I anticipated, Myne.”\n\n\n The High Priest turned around. He was donned in his own ceremonial robes, a different one from those he usually wore. Though they were blue, there were lots of embroidered leaves on it, it was accompanied with red decorations, the colour of winter and a gold sash worn by adults.\n\n\n “There doesn’t seem to be any other blue priests,” I commented.\n\n\n “We have sufficient mana that they don’t need to be present,” replied the High Priest. I only thought about how they would only be insulted when they saw a commoner girl they mocked could offer more mana they could ever hope to have. I was completely unbothered about their absence, being around them was not a nice experience for me anyways.\n\n\n “But this is not for their pride,” the High Priest remarked, as though he had seen through me and I was surprised by what he said… “When individuals come together for the same goal and say the same prayers, their mana will flow together, speeding up the process because te mana is able to leave the body more easily. If the blue priests were to become entangled in the mana you release, they might get trapped in it and get injured.”\n\n\n “.I see.”\n\n\n “I am the only one who can do this with you. We shall begin.”\n\n\n The High Priest knelt down in front of the altar, he touched the cloth on the floor while I did the same behind him.\n\n\n The most important ritual in the temple was the Dedication Ritual. It was here that we priests and shrine maidens replenished the divine instruments with the mana needed for next year’s harvest. We make mana flow into the divine instruments only by praying and placing with our hands on the crimson cloth on the floor and over the altar. This was because the cloth was made from thread imbued with mana.\n\n\n “I offer my prayer and thanks to the gods who have created this world.”\n\n\n I recited the prayer after the High Priest, whose quiet, methodical voice boomed across the ceremonial hall.\n\n\n “O mighty King and Queen of the immortal sky, and the mighty Eternal Five who rule over the mortal realm. O Goddess of Water Flutrane, O God of Fire Leidenschaft, O Goddess of Wind Schutzaria, O Goddess of Earth Gedulth, O God of Life Ewigeliebe. We honor you who have blessed this land with life, and pray for your continued blessings from your divine powers.”\n\n\n With every word I spoke, I felt the mana coursing through my body. The cloth began to glow and within the light, I saw my mana flowing through it towards the altar.\n\n\n “Myne, enough.” ordered the High Priest as he gracefully removed his hand from the cloth. I followed him and cut off the mana, witnessing the last spark fizzle out into the chalice.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n The High Priest said, “That should be all for today.” after looking at the small chalices. “There was a lot more mana than I expected.”\n\n\n We had filled seven today, and some quick math told me that we would only take eight days to fill them all…\n\n\n “If you were not here, I would have had to fill these all by myself, even though I have other responsibilities in the Noble’s District…” The High Priest sighed in exhaustion, which was a rare sight.\n\n\n I also looked at the chalices on the altar and nodded along.\n\n\n So that’s why the High Priest was so nice to me. It would be exhausting for anyone to have to fill all of these by themselves. I’d always wondered why he gave so little mana during our regular offerings, and now I know why, it’s because he works in the Noble’s District that I don’t have to. That’s rough.\n\n\n As a result, I did the Dedication Ritual everyday. It was only me and the High Priest every time, no other blue priests would be present. This went on for almost a week, and then the High Priest brought in ten new chalices just as we were about done.\n\n\n “Myne, the ritual will have to go on longer. May I request for your assistance?”\n\n\n “Did something happen?” I asked. He told me that the neighbouring duchy had a severe shortage of mana that was worse than ours, and requested for our help if we had anymore mana to spare.\n\n\n “We can use this chance to win some political points and favors from them. It will be tiring, but it will be wise to seize this opportunity.”\n\n\n “…Uhm, haven’t we already established a good relationship with them?”\n\n\n “Yes, indeed, but that is exactly why we need to strengthen our foothold by regulating assisting them. There is no point maintaining a good relationship is we are not the ones in power.”\n\n\n …Politics sure is scary.\n\n\n I realised that my own idea of friendship didn’t apply to that here when it comes to establishing a good relationship with another duchy, needed to protect one’s own duchy. Two duchies with good terms did not translate to two people going well together. I understood all these but I still had trouble accepting it.\n\n\n Even if there was no politics behind this, I had no problems offering help needed by the archduke. Moreover, I had too much mana that I barely used because I did not know how to or have any feystones or magic tools for personal use.\n\n\n ““I offer my prayer and thanks to the gods who have created this world.”\n\n\n Both of us poured our mana into the little chalices, but we were interrupted in the middle by the creek from the chamber door opening.\n\n\n “I see that you’re praying well.”\n\n\n Both the High Priest and I stood up and turned around. The High Bishop who had never stepped into the hall for the ritual was now in the room. He strolled to the altar while carryig a bag filled with something unknown.\n\n\n “Did something happen, High Bishop?” asked the High Priest, but there was no reply.\n\n\n The High Bishop just silently took out a few small chalices from his bag, he placed them on the altar one by one. After lining up ten of them, he turned back to us and gave a polite smile, the same one I had seen before he learned that I was a commoner.\n\n\n “Now then, Myne. You will fill these with mana too. Orders from the archduke himself.”\n\n\n “I have not been informed of this.” The High Priest looked at the High Bishop in suspicion. The High Bishop gave a piercing gaze but his smile remained the same.\n\n\n “The request is not for you. I am asking Myne. Don’t tell me your orders are superior to mine, the High Bishop’s.”\n\n\n I had to make my choice to obey or to not, but I already had so many enemies so it would not be a good idea to disobey an order from the High Bishops. Disobeying him will cause me more trouble.\n\n\n In the end, I just looked at the High Priest for help. He understood why I looked at him and gave a troubled look back before nodding slowly.\n\n\n “We are done with today’s ritual. If you allow us, we will do it by tomorrow.”\n\n\n “Do not forget what you said.”\n\n\n The High Bishop’s smile turned into an ugly one before he made his way out of the ritual hall. One of the gray priests shut the door after he left. The hall was finally quiet, but the silence was broken with the High Priest’s sigh.\n\n\n “I was worried that you would get emotional again. But it is evident that the archduke was not behind these extra chalices.”\n\n\n “So, so we have to fill them? I don’t mind trying to gain some favours…” The High Priest was silent as he pondered on, after a while he gave his answer with a frown.\n\n\n “We will continue as we have done so previously. Leave this case to me, I will approach the archduke about this matter but the snow will delay the time it will take. It would be best for you to follow his orders. May I ask for your cooperation?”\n\n\n “Of course.”\n\n\n After which, my days were occupied with having to fill the small chalices which were increasing in numbers over time."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n It was almost the middle of Winter. I was on the way back to my chambers after finishing today’s offering for the Dedication Ritual.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, what will we be doing for the Coming of Age Ceremony?” Fran asked out of the blue. I looked at him in surprise as I did not understand what he meant by that.\n\n\n “Coming of Age Ceremony? But I just got baptized.”\n\n\n “It’s not yours Sister Myne but Rosina’s” Fran replied with a hand over his mouth as he tried to stifle his laughter. But what he said still surprised me that my mouth and eyes went wide open.\n\n\n “Rosina’s… Coming of Age Ceremony?”\n\n\n “Yes. Rosina will come of age at the end of winter”\n\n\n “I-I did not know at all…” My disappointment in myself was imminent as I felt that I had failed my responsibility as a master - I did not know the most basic things about my own attendants.\n\n\n “Gray shrine maidens typically receive clothes by the temple. Those from the orphanage will only get that but it is quite a common for attendants to receive another gift from their master.”\n\n\n Fran explained how the Coming of Age Ceremony went for the orphanage. Those reached of age would clean themselves in the early morning, put on their new clothes gifted by the temple, before offering their prayers and thanks in the chapel. This all took place before the lower city’s Coming of Age Ceremony that started at the third bell. So that basically meant that the Baptism Ceremony and the Coming of Age Ceremony will finish when I practice my harspiel.”\n\n\n “I-I haven’t got the chance to congratulate any of the children in the orphanage…”\n\n\n Was it fine for the orphanage director to act this way?\n\n\n I know I had been quite busy with temple, but that was not an acceptable excuse. My face paled as blood drained from it, but my reaction only received Fran’s laughing.\n\n\n “As an apprentice shrine maiden, you are not allowed to partake in the temple ceremonies, so it’s not your fault that you did not know of this. Additionally, you were sick in bed during the summer’s Coming of Age Ceremony and the Baptism Ceremony in Fall. Currently, our schedule has jammed packed with winter preparations. It would stir up feelings of dissatisfaction amongst others if you only celebrated the ceremony for a some.”\n\n\n Matters in the orphanage had to promote equality as much as possible, so Fran always cautioned others against things that might be seen as unfair. However, I still wanted to congratulate the orphans even if I did not have any gifts.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, please give up the idea of presenting the orphans with any gifts,” Fran repeated sternly, “It will cause more trouble in the long run.”\n\n\n I understood the point he was trying to make. If I did choose to present gifts to the orphans during my term as the orphanage director, my successor might not do the same. Furthermore, it had been confirmed that I would attend the Royal Academy when I turned ten, so my tenure was temporary. That was why Fran wanted me to consider how my actions would impact the temple in the long run.\n\n\n “Please take note, Sister Myne, I only said that the blue robes priest and priestess have gifted their attendants because I know that you would try to do so regularly even without anyone telling you so. Preparing gifts is not a necessary action.”\n\n\n I probably would not have realised this myself, yet Fran had taken the effort to tell me when Rosina was coming of age because he knew that I would want to give her a present. Of course, he got that right. I did not know which seasons my attendants were born in. I knew Rosina was about to come of age, but I did not know when exactly.\n\n\n “Fran, thank you for telling me. I need some help thinking about what to give to Rosina, may I ask what did the High Priest give you for your Coming of Age Ceremony?”\n\n\n “A pen and some ink. I still have it now. I was very happy when I received it, it felt as though he finally acknowledged me as an adult.” Fran gave a mellow grin as he reminisced. Perhaps he told me about Rosina’s coming of age because he knew how happy he had been for his own.\n\n\n Since I was her master, I had to think of a gift that Rosina would like. I always got it wrong in guessing what others liked, so I definitely needed to do some proper research on what would be suitable for Coming of Age ceremonies. First off, I need to consult those close to me. Lutz would be my obvious first choice, but I can’t meet him until this blizzard ended. Other than my attendants, the only one I was close to in the temple was the High Priest. So…\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n “High Priest, my attendant is about to come of age. May I ask what would be a suitable gift I could give her?” I asked after we completed our work.\n\n\n He gave a surprised look and hummed under his breath a somewhat insulting comment, “Never quite expected such a reasonable question from you,” before clearing his throat.\n\n\n “For a Coming of Age Ceremony, a good gift is one that lasts for a long time. A basic one will be one they will use for work. I typically give my attendants a pen and ink.”\n\n\n “Something Rosina is able to use often for work… Hm, I can only think of an instrument,” I thought aloud, but that made the High Priest glare at me.\n\n\n “Fool. Why would you give an instrument that costs a hefty price when you do not have one yourself? Get yourself one before you considering getting one for your attendant,” he said with some annoyance. Time for me to retreat.\n\n\n “You are right. Thank you for your input. I will think of an alternative.”\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n It had been a few days since the High Priest’s lectures, the blizzard had finally died down, so Tuuli, Lutz and Benno all visited my chambers.\n\n\n “How are you, Myne?” asked Tuuli.\n\n\n “Tuuli, Lutz! Oh, and Benno.”\n\n\n “I’ll be heading off to the orphanage to study, but they wanted to talk to you about something.”\n\n\n Tulli left after saying hello, only Lutz and Benno stayed in my room. Benno saw Damuel inside and went stiff.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, I would like to send an Ieherl here to be trained as a waiter under your supervision.”.\n\n\n Benno wanted me to train an leherl, Leon, here. I peeked at Fran, who might be the one to train him.\n\n\n “Do you think it’s possible for me to agree to this, Fran?”\n\n\n “Now that I can delegate work to Rosina and Wilma, I have some time to teach how to wait on someone during lunch,” he said. I observed that his face was a little more frigid, I took note of that and looked back at Benno.\n\n\n “Fine then, Benno. We will only train him how to be a waiter, so please send someone who has received proper training.”\n\n\n “Proper training?” Benno was bewildered by my remark. While visiting his store, Lutz and I realized that his personnel were well-trained to deal with wealthy consumers. When we were led to Benno’s office, we were treated like honored guests, and because Benno respected our work, we never had anyone who treated us disrespectfully. So of course, Benno expected all his staff to be experienced enough to be trained here.\n\n\n “Fran will be in charge of teaching your worker, but he is a gray priest and an orphan. We will have to turn away anyone that has sufficient training that they would disrespect or look down on him.”\n\n\n According to Fran, all of Benno’s employees were polite to customers but only half of them were nice to servants. Apparently when I was in the back office talking with Benno, several in the store would glare at Fran.\n\n\n “Oh, so you have witnessed such untrained employees in my store? Please accept my deepest apologies, it appears that I have trained them sufficiently. If by any chance, Leon belongs to this section of lacking employees, please notify me immediately so that I can terminate his leherl contract.”\n\n\n “Fran, do you have any additional requests? Or is that everything?”\n\n\n “Uhm… I have no qualms teaching Leon how to wait, but food will not be provided for him. The food here is only for Sister Myne.”\n\n\n “Do not worry, I will take charge of that just as I have been for Lutz.”\n\n\n Benno and Fran began discussing the terms of the contract, so I took the chance to call Lutz over and whispered.\n\n\n “Lutz, I need to ask you something.”\n\n\n “What? Do you have another crazy idea again?” Lutz exclaimed with a weary look, and Fran and Benno heard him and stopped midway to look at us.\n\n\n “Crazy idea? That’s so mean, Lutz. I just wanted to talk about Rosina’s Coming of Age ceremony. Do you know what gifts are usually prepared for these ceremonies? It’s almost Zasha’s turn soon.”\n\n\n “I think my parents will give him tools for work. The ones he received after his baptism are now too small, as they were for children.”\n\n\n The tools for children after their baptism were usually lighter or smaller so that it was easier for them to carry. However, as the youngsters grew older, it became harder to use them. Some purchased new ones before reaching adulthood, while others received second-hand-ones, but they would receive new ones when they come of age.\n\n\n “Crafting tools. I see… Benno, what do merchants give for Coming of Age ceremonies?”\n\n\n “Accessories for my family and clothing for my leherls. Both are necessary when meeting nobles.”\n\n\n “How about your lehanges?”\n\n\n “I do not give them anything.”\n\n\n Leherls were important and would attend meetings too once they came of age. On the other hand, most lehanges left after their contract ended, so they saw no point giving them any congratulatory gifts.\n\n\n “Accessories and clothing will be wonderful… but I don’t think Rosina would wear either of them very often.”\n\n\n “But won’t she start bunning her hair up?” Lutz recommended, “Maybe we can try getting her a comb or a ribbon.”\n\n\n A pretty hairpin with decorations might be a lovely present for her. I noted it in my diptych.\n\n\n “Please feel free to order a hairpin from Lutz if you require it.”\n\n\n “Thank you for your advice.”\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n After ending his conversation with Fran, Benno returned to his store. I went to the orphanage with Lutz to visit Tuuli, while Fran and Damuel followed behind.\n\n\n “Tuuli is putting forth a lot of effort,” Lutz noted. “Myne, you should send her a letter in simple words.”\n\n\n “All right, I’ll do it. Thank you.”\n\n\n Lutz appeared to have been teaching Tuuli sometimes. He said he was only repeating what I did for him the previous year, but she was still able to keep up with the orphanage children.\n\n\n “Now please try to finish this problem.”\n\n\n Today was a math day at the orphanage. In my peripheral, I noticed Tuuli glaring at her abacus as I walked over to Wilma. Wilma and Rosina had both previously worked for the same master, so I figured I could gain something from what Wilma received for her coming of age.\n\n\n “Oh, now that you mentioned it, Rosina indeed is coming of age this winter,” Wilma said.\n\n\n “Yes, but I have no idea what I should give her. What did Sister Christine give you for your coming or age, Wilma?”\n\n\n Wilma gave a pained smile as she looked conflicted.\n\n\n “Sister Christine left the temple before I came of age, so I did not receive anything special.”\n\n\n “…What? If that’s so then I need to get you one too.”\n\n\n I had never considered the possibility that Wilma had not been given anything, so I quickly offered to get her something too. But she only laughed back as her mouth upturned into a sweet smile.\n\n\n “If you’re worried about that, Sister Myne, you’ll have to offer gifts to all of your other attendants.” She explained that neither Delia nor Gil received anything for their baptisms.\n\n\n “Wouldn’t Delia feel less happy for her celebration if you present gifts for me, Gil, and Delia too? And Fran might feel lonely if he doesn’t get one too.”\n\n\n “Mmm…” I just wanted to make everyone happy, but that seemed to be a difficult feat…\n\n\n I was lost in thought when Wilma leaned forward with her normal calm grin on her face “Any present from our master brings joy to us servants. Not to mention that whatever Rosina wants will definitely be music related… Perhaps some new music scores will make her happy?”\n\n\n “New music scores! That might be a good idea.”\n\n\n “…But it would have to be quite rare for it not to be in Sister Christine’s collection.”\n\n\n Let’s just say I’ll have no trouble finding new music for her…\n\n\n I paid a visit to the High Priest the very next day.\n\n\n “High Priest, For Rosina’s coming of age ceremony, I’ve decided to offer her new sheet music. Please teach me how I can go about making one.”\n\n\n “What songs are you planning to write down?”\n\n\n “Of course the ones I know.”\n\n\n It would be almost impossible for me to find music here that Sister Christine, the art-obsessed shrine maiden, didn’t already have in her collection. So instead all I had to do was jot down some tunes from Earth. It probably wouldn’t be that difficult if I knew how to write music…\n\n\n “Do you mean the ones you remember from your dreams?”\n\n\n “Of course. I can’t think of any other songs Rosina didn’t already know.”\n\n\n “Fran, fetch me the harspiel from her room.”\n\n\n Fran gave an, “Understood.”\n\n\n The High Priest showed me how to write music scores while Fran left to retrieve my instrument. Of course, it didn’t look anything like the sheet music I knew. I knew how to write scales using the other sheet music I used as a guide, but I did not understand their notations or signatures.\n\n\n “I have returned.”\n\n\n “Thank you, Fran.” I began strumming the small harspiel Fran brought over while trying to recall how the music went in my head.\n\n\n “Oh? That ain’t it… Maybe like this? Oh, that’s it, right. It goes like this… Hm~hm~hm~~~” Once I finished working on part of the song, I transposed it onto the paper and asked the High Priest to check it.\n\n\n “High Priest, is this correct?”\n\n\n “…Enough of this. Hand me the harspiel.”\n\n\n The High Priest had reached his breaking point at the fifth bar and took matters into his hand. He tried to adjust himself to the tiny harspiel for children and stared back at me.\n\n\n “You will sing it. I will transpose the notes. It will be much faster for me to do the transposing than to wait for you to learn it.”\n\n\n I started humming the song after being inspired by his stern expression. I kept going until the High Priest stopped me with a raised hand. When I did, he started playing the entire passage that I had just hummed. My mouth went wide open as he played around with the notes, arranging it into a way that it suited the harspiel as he went along, before composing it onto the paper.\n\n\n …Is there anything the High Priest can’t do?\n\n\n He had memorised the song from my humming and arranged it for the harspiel onto the sheet music instantly.\n\n\n “Any other songs you know of, Myne?”\n\n\n “…I can’t think of many right now, but if you only need to hear my humming, I can do a lot more.”\n\n\n The High Priest nodded to show his satisfaction at my response. “Then hum it.”\n\n\n “Wah?”\n\n\n “I suddenly remembered I wanted some new music for myself now. Yes, three would be nice.”\n\n\n I had no problems humming three more songs for him because he was the one who was troubling himself to arrange and transpose them for me. I even took advantage of the opportunity to transpose some anime music. It was entertaining to watch the High Priest so engrossed with arranging the song’s notes.\n\n\n “You may copy them and give them to her.”\n\n\n “Words cannot begin to describe how thankful I am.”\n\n\n I hid the handwritten music sheets from the High Priest in my drawer and copied them in secret whenever Rosina and Fran were occupied with paperwork. After that, I had Lutz cut holes in the sides of the four songs and bind them together with string.\n\n\n “It’s done!”\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n Time flew by and the coming of age ceremony took place on the last Earthday of winter. Delia and Gil toiled away early in the morning to get water for Rosina to wash herself in. After that, she changed into her new clothes provided by the temple. Her skirt used to be at her calves, but now it was long enough to reach her shoes, and now she also had her hair bunned on top of her head.\n\n\n “It’s such a pity that you have to tie up your pretty hair now, Rosina.” I was a little disappointed that I would not be able to see Rosina’s lovely and wavy chestnut hair flowing behind her anymore. But Delia was only envious of Rosina’s new hairstyle.\n\n\n “It’s not a waste! How I wish I could bun my hair up now.”\n\n\n Wilma always wore her hair in a tight and simple bun, but Rosina preferred hers to be loose and more feminine looking. Rosina was mature looking for her age so having her hair bunned up now completed her look of that of an adult woman. Her slender neck was completely visible, having some stray locks of shining hair made her look more sensuous.\n\n\n “You look so pretty, Rosina.” I sighed in a daze at Rosina’s mature looks, this made her smile with a blush.\n\n\n “Geez!” yelled Delia. “I’ll look even better when I’m an adult.”\n\n\n “Of course, I’m sure you’ll look amazing too, Delia.” I returned an entertained smile to Delia before congratulating Rosina and escorted her to the chapel for her coming of age ceremony.\n\n\n “Rosina, I’ll see you soon.”\n\n\n “Yes, Sister Myne, until then.”\n\n\n I did not need to assist the High Priest with the paperwork today because all the priests would be preoccupied with the Coming of Age Ceremony. Rosina also not around to lead my harspiel classes too.\n\n\n Since I had nothing to do, I made my way to the orphanage with Fran and Damuel to make some parue batter with Wilma. I was not going to teach Ella the recipe and the children would get curious if they smelt it from the girls’ building. So I asked her to prepare the batter first and cook it in my kitchen.\n\n\n “Wilma, do you mind staying in my chambers for Rosina’s sake? There will be men around, but you are familiar with all of them. I believe Rosina would be happier if you were around to share her joy.”\n\n\n “…I think I would like to come. I’m slightly more used to being around men since there have been gray priests helping out in the dining hall and workshop. I believe I should be fine in the celebration for a short moment.”\n\n\n I returned to my chambers with Wilma, who carried a bowl of parue cake batter. Fran and Damuel were shocked to see her, but they chose to keep a comfortable distance for her.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n “I am back, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n “Welcome back, Rosina. We’ve been waiting for you.”\n\n\n Rosina was back in my chambers after the Coming of Age Ceremony before the third bell rang. When she arrived at the second floor, I pulled her over to a chair.\n\n\n “Sister Myne?”\n\n\n “Sit down here, Rosina.”\n\n\n “But I cannot sit down before my master.” Rosina insisted that she could not sit down. I looked at her in a loss, in the end Fran pulled back my seat and sighed.\n\n\n “Rosina is right, Sister Myne. You must first sit down yourself if you want Rosina to do so too.”\n\n\n I listened and sat down, and Rosina did the same with a troubled look. In the next instance, a sweet smell wafted across the room.\n\n\n “Wilma?!” Wilma greeted her with a warm smile as she placed a platter of parue cakes in front of her. Delia seemed particularly solemn as she poured a cup of tea.\n\n\n “You are today’s star of the celebration, Rosina,” Wilma replied. “I made these for you at Sister Myne’s request.”\n\n\n “…They look good.” Rosina’s blue eyes welled up with tears as she glanced at the parue cakes and the poured tea, We all gathered around the table. I looked at Fran, who had gone to my desk to get the sheet music.\n\n\n “These music sheets are a present from me to you. Please practice well and play them for me if possible.”\n\n\n “…These songs, I know none of them. How did you…? Sister Myne, thank you so much. You brought everyone over for me, and… I… I-I don’t know what I can say to everyone…”\n\n\n Rosina revealed a bright smile as she hugged the music scores to her chest.\n\n\n “Congratulations on your coming of age, Rosina. We pray that the gods will continue to bless you and the bright future you have ahead.””"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n According to the calendar, it was almost spring so the number of blizzards was dying down, but the cold was still ruthless that it did not feel anything like spring outside. Anyways, less blizzards would mean that Tuuli could visit more often. The day I could return home was fast approaching and I was so excited.\n\n\n One day, Tuuli brought with her a small bottle.\n\n\n “Hey, Myne. You said that this could be eaten when winter comes, what should we do with it now? We didn’t know what to do with it, so Mum told me to ask you.”\n\n\n She placed the bottle on the table and opened it. The distinct smell of alcohol hit me straight in the face. Inside the jar were some fruits soaking in wine, it was the rumtopf I had been fermenting at home. I gave an excited exclaim, I had forgotten how much effort I spent trying to make this during the summer\n\n\n “Ooohhh! Since we already have sugar and honey here, and the homemade jam, this slipped off my mind!”\n\n\n “…I knew it.”\n\n\n The rumtopf that was made from various fruits steeped in wine was finally finished. The once sharp edges of the fruit had disintegrated in the wine, and it now looked round. It was ready to be eaten, but what would be the best way to prepare it?\n\n\n “This is hard. I made this thinking that I could make some ice cream or pudding to complement it, but parue cakes are the most convenient pastries to make at home.”\n\n\n I made all these plans back during the summer, that was before I found out that I had to spend my whole winter in the temple. I was going to trade some sugar and the rumtopf at Lutz’s place for some eggs, milk, and labor needed for my ice cream and pudding. They would be eaten with some chopped-up rumtopf garnished on top. But that was not possible to do at Lutz place now so I needed an alternative for my family to eat it.\n\n\n “We can just eat these with parue cakes?” Tuuli asked.\n\n\n “You have to cut the fruits into smaller bits. You and Mom can eat the fruit, Dad will be happy with the leftover wine. If you want something else other than parue cakes, it goes well with French toast too! You remember that we ate that before, right? And, um… And there’s also…”\n\n\n Rumtopf was usually eaten with the traditional German bread stollen, but our home didn’t have an oven to bake bread.\n\n\n “Myne, calm down. Is there anything we can make here to eat with it? We can’t make parue cakes here, right?”\n\n\n “…Right.”\n\n\n I did not want Ella to find out the recipe for the parue cakes, so if we wanted her help we could not make them here. But if we made them in the kitchen in the girls’ building, we did not have enough rumptof for all the orphans.\n\n\n “That’s tough. Stollen is the usual pairing, but that takes too much time. Hmm… Maybe we can get Ella to make crepes instead?”\n\n\n “…You don’t mind others knowing the recipe?” Tuuli knew that my recipes were a secret. They had been saved for both the Italian restaurant and Freida, so she was a little worried.\n\n\n “It should be ok. I’ve already saw something like crepes here so…”\n\n\n I was thinking about the meat pies that resembled galettes, they were simply made with beef, mushroom, cheese, and other ingredients in buckwheat dough. They were sold in restaurants as a light snack. However, no desserts that used the galette were sold. At least, not to my knowledge. After all, the people from the lower city only cared about filling themselves rather than eating tasty pastries.\n\n\n “Fran, how long would it take for you to make some cream?”“Since the weather is quite cold, it should not take long. How much will you need?”\n\n\n I looked back and saw that Fran was holding onto his diptych, ready to take notes.\n\n\n Because the fat would separate from the natural milk when kept cold, making cream was not a difficult task as long as you had the milk. Though you had to be careful to make sure not too much water is lost or it would turn into cream with curdled bits.\n\n\n “A cup of cream and a cup of milk, please.”\n\n\n Galettes can be made with the buckwheat flour in the kitchen’s pantry, but I prefer plain crepes.\n\n\n Nobles usually used sugar to make pastries, therefore it would be better to make noble-esque food in my kitchen than to mimic those in the lower city. So, we were going to make crepes with whipped cream and minced rumtopf.\n\n\n Fran went to the temple’s noble area to get some cream from the ice room that he told me where they were kept in, in the meantime I would write down the crepe recipe. Ella will have to make the crepes totally from scratch while following my instructions throughout.\n\n\n “Hey, Tuuli, what’s that food called… uhm…you know the one where people make the batter by mixing buckwheat flour, water and salt, then they cook it with ham and cheese?”\n\n\n “Oh, buchretes1?”\n\n\n “I think that’s it.”\n\n\n I did not know what they called galettes here, so I just wrote “make it thin like a buchrete.”\n\n\n Just as I was about done writing the recipe, Fran was back with two jars each filled with milk and cream. He passed them to the kitchen before coming up to the second floor, and received the board with the recipe.\n\n\n “Fran, please tell Ella to make this. She has to cook it like buchretes, and that she only needs to cook the batter part plain. She should be able to understand that. After that, please put them on a plate and bring it here.”\n\n\n “Understood.”\n\n\n Fran received the board from me, at the same time, Tuuli stood up with the rumtopf jar.\n\n\n “Um, Fran. May I see Ella cook? I want to help out, if needed!”\n\n\n It was obvious that Tuuli was curious about professional chefs, so I tried to help her.\n\n\n “Fran, Tuuli is quite familiar with the food I make and won’t cause any trouble. Ask Ella whether she would be interested in working with her. I would like to go too, but I am afraid it would make everyone too nervous to work well. I will stay here while you look after Tuuli.”\n\n\n Making sweets together was something girly and, to me, it seemed really fun. Ella had been cooking all winter with the help of Nicola and Monika, and they always seemed to be having fun even when they talked during their breaks. I wished I could join Tuuli in the kitchen, but as an apprentice blue shrine maiden, that was not likely so I had to remain seated.\n\n\n “So rich girls have it tough, huh?” Tuuli looked at me with sympathy, she knew I had no freedom in my own room.\n\n\n I nodded back at her. I was the odd one out in the temple because I came from a different place, so having someone who could empathize with my circumstances was a relief.\n\n\n “Uh huh. Looks matter to everyone here.”\n\n\n “…Looks, so your socks too?”\n\n\n We both looked down at my feet at the same time. Then we looked back at each other and laughed. It was difficult to pretend to be a rich noble girl.\n\n\n “What was that about your socks, Sister Myne?” Delia walked in after Tuuli and Fran went to the kitchen, her eyes shining with intrigue. Delia usually scooted over when the conversation turned to clothes or hair, and I couldn’t help smiling.\n\n\n “We were just laughing about how the socks were so cold.”\n\n\n My socks were thin and went halfway up my thighs, they were tied up with a string since this world did not have any rubber. When I got dressed in the temple every morning, the first thing I did was put a cloth around my waist. After that, I put on my socks and fastened them to the belt with strings. It basically resembled a garter belt.\n\n\n After that, I wore thin culotte-like clothes that went below my knees. Strings sewed at the edges of the cloth at my knees, which let me tighten them around my legs. It was not an underwear I enjoyed wearing because it felt breezy compared to those I wore as Urano. To finish off, I wore a shirt.\n\n\n But of course, I could not expose my legs. Exposing one’s legs was something despicable and shameful to the rich, even more so for the nobles, so everyone there would always wear socks. Covering up was vital to one’s self-image and dignity, so anyone who did not wear socks was seen as an embarrassment.\n\n\n I began wearing socks with the Gilberta Company’s apprentice clothes, and in the temple, all the priests and shrine maidens wore socks yoo.\n\n\n “…Sister Myne, why did you say the socks are cold?”\n\n\n “It’s not like the socks of the lower city which are made to be more practical.”\n\n\n Socks were made for comfort, not looks. They were not worn in the summer. Only during the winter, we would wear bag-like socks made out of wool over our feet and they only reached to our ankles. Instead, we wore wool leg warmers to cover our knees and sometimes a layer of pants for more warmth.\n\n\n “But Tuuli’s socks don’t look fashionable,” Delia complained.\n\n\n “Indeed so. But some rather choose warmth over fashion.”\n\n\n “…If you want to feel warmth, why don’t you get boots?”\n\n\n Nobles cared so much about their appearances and fashion sense that they did not wear wool leg warmers. Instead, they chose to wear knee-high fur-edged boots. Those boots did look warm.\n\n\n I was not aware that leg warmers were not allowed in the temple, and I was broke enough let alone getting boots. Instead, I wore the Gilberta Company apprentices’ short leather boots that allowed for easier movement.\n\n\n “If I were an adult, I could hide them under a long skirt…”\n\n\n When I tried to put on leg warmers to keep warm, Rosina stopped me. My skirts were shorter and they exposed my knees, leg warmers would be seen. I was so disappointed that I sighed, but this made Delia raise her brows and give me a harsh look.\n\n\n “Geez! You just don’t care about fashion, even if nobody sees it!”\n\n\n Wow… Delia’s is crazy about fashion.\n\n\n Warmth over fashion for me, but as they said ‘when in Rome and so as the Romans do’.\n\n\n “I will take in mind to get taller boots for next winter. I do not want to fall sick from the cold again.”\n\n\n “That would be for the best.”\n\n\n “You need to get some new shoes soon, Sister Myne,” Rosina interrupted, as she took a break from her work. “You do not own stylish, high-end shoes that are a necessity for a proper lady. Please consider sending a request to Master Benno to seek a shoemaker.”\n\n\n She warned me that I might find myself in a pickle if I only brought a pair of plain shoes with me for the upcoming Spring Prayer.\n\n\n “We still have enough time to get them before Spring Prayer, that is if you order them now.”\n\n\n “Rosina, please continue to advise me on matters like this so that I am better prepared.”\n\n\n “Yes, I will do my best to do so. I was just not sure what you already had and lacked, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n Rosina had no idea about the fact that I only owned one pair of shoes. She just assumed that I had been wearing different shoes of the same design, it was only after I entered the temple did she discover the glaring truth.\n\n\n There are two common types of shoes in the lower city. First was the shabby wooden shoes that the poor wore, next was the leather ones worn by the rich. As a last resort, those who could not afford wooden shoes would wrap their feet with rag or go barefoot, both of which was not rare right\n\n\n Up until I had my Gilberta Company apprentice attire, I always wore wooden shoes and never thought about getting new shoes before the old ones broke. Despite the fact that I had owned multiple pairs of shoes for different occasions throughout my Urano days, my new circumstance gave me a whole new perspective on shoes.\n\n\n I opened my diptych and noted to “Ask Benno to order shoes”.\n\n\n “All right, Sister Myne! Which leather are you interested in? Horse leather? Or pig leather? Oh, and just in case, how about getting a pair of cotton ones too?” Delia’s eyes twinkled with glee. When it came to fashion, she was quite ready to bite.\n\n\n But, unfortunately for her, I knew nothing about fashion so I did not have the prior knowledge to decide what shoes I needed to buy, nor did I know what designs were in trend or other matters like what materials were most commonly used. My objective was to let Rosina make the decision and learn from her.\n\n\n “Rosina will be in charge of designing my shoes. Please order ones I will most likely need for future events. If it were up to me, I would probably get the same ones I already own.”\n\n\n “Understood. Please leave it up to me.”\n\n\n Rosina explained to me what shoes were worn for what occasions. Soon after, Fran and Tuuli returned from the kitchen with plates. One was full with fresh white cream, the other with minced rumtopf.\n\n\n “Delia, please prepare the tea.”\n\n\n “Understood.”\n\n\n With Fran’s instruction, Delia left for the kitchen. Tuuli and Fran placed the cutlery neatly on the table, they returned to the kitchen again and came back with another plate with two round and freshly made crepes. Each for me and Tuuli.\n\n\n “Sorry for the wait, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n Fran placed the dish on the table for me. The crepes looked identical to the ones I was familiar with, a delicious smell swirled around my nostrils and it made me smile\n\n\n “I helped cut these!” Tuuli exclaimed with pride and she pointed at the rumtopf. She began reiterating how good Tuuli was at cooking and how much effort her helpers had put into it\n\n\n “Sorry Fran, would you mind bringing over some honey too? Oh, please ask Ella if she could come up too.”\n\n\n “May I ask why?”\n\n\n “I want to teach her how to nicely decorate these sweets. So that she can make the whole thing by herself in the future.”\n\n\n Fran was not comfortable with the idea of bringing a chef to the second floor but I did not want Ella to misunderstand that the recipe was over after making the crepe.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, you can show me what comes next, I will teach her the remaining steps.”\n\n\n “Then watch carefully, Fran.”\n\n\n With everyone watching me, I used a spoon to get some cream and smoothed it over one-sixth of the half of the fan-like crepe that was closer to me. After that I used the spoon to sprinkle the rumtopf.\n\n\n “Spread the cream into a triangle on half of the crepe that is closer to you. To make it better, make sure the layer of cream is a little thin. Then, on top of the cream, sprinkle the rumtopf, it’s better with more. Rumtopf can be replaced with whatever fruit is in season, so this recipe is very flexible.”\n\n\n I topped it up with some honey before finishing up with folding and rolling the crepe.\n\n\n “You can eat the crepe with your hands if you do it this way. If you prefer using silverware like a noble, simply fold it instead of rolling it up. Then all you have to do is finish it up with cream, fruit, and honey.”\n\n\n I unrolled the crepe and scooped some cream beside it, garnishing it with some rumtopf and honey decoration to make it look cute.\n\n\n Fran kept blinking in surprise at the final product.\n\n\n “…This certainly looks something like the nobles would enjoy.”\n\n\n “Amazing, it’s so cute! It must taste good, Myne!” Tuuli was giddy with anticipation and began prepping her own crepe.\n\n\n Delia was curiously observing, but she had to wait till after we had eaten before she could try some. I found it unfortunate that my attendants could not eat with me, but it was a rule set in stone and I had no control over it.\n\n\n “It’s done!” Tuuli declared with a contented voice as she examined her product. She was quite talented to have made such a nice dish despite this being her first time decorating.\n\n\n “I offer thanks and prayers to thee, O mighty King and Queen of the eternal sky who have graced us with thousands and thousands of lives for sustenance, thee O mighty Immortal Five who look over the mortal realm, I shall be grateful to partake in this blessed meal.”\n\n\n I cut a mouthful of the crepe without any cream and brought it to my mouth. The crepe was soft and not too sweet, and it was not too crispy at the edges. I continued to cut off another part with cream. The cream and the crepe’s supple texture did not taste that sweet, but paired with the honey it now had the perfect amount of sweetness. I relished the taste before adding on some rumtopf. As I bit into the soft fruit, my mouth washed over with the distinct alcohol taste and pleasant sweetness.\n\n\n “How is it, Tuuli?”\n\n\n “It’s delicious, Myne!” Tuuli’s lips curled into a delighted smile and it was dirtied with cream.\n\n\n “Tuuli, your mouth has cream on it.”\n\n\n “They are just too hard to eat.”\n\n\n Using silverware to eat crepes required considerable finesse. Tuuli’s fight with the crepe concluded with her mouth covered with cream, this made me smile. Food tastes so much better when you share it with others.\n\n\n “This is the best. Next off, I want to eat caramel custard. Let’s see if we can try making it the next time you visit Tuuli?”\n\n\n “New pastries? Yesss! I’ll look forward to it!”\n\n\n I really wanted to return home as soon as possible so that I could share these delectable treats and this wonderful joy with my entire family once more."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n After receiving the High Priest’s permission to allow a merchant to my chambers, I sent a request to Benno to find a shoemaker for me.\n\n\n “May you be blessed with the melting of snow. May the Goddess of Spring’s grace you with her kindness.” Benno greeted me with the blessing that celebrated the coming of spring before entering my chambers with the shoemakers.\n\n\n “May you be blessed by the Goddess of Water Flutrane and her followers,” I returned to blessing while seated in the room.\n\n\n Damuel, who was now my bodyguard, was carefully inspecting Benno, the shoemaker who was probably the same age as Benno, and his assistant took my feet measurements and asked me what design and material I wanted.\n\n\n “Hm,” Rosina muttered out loud. “It is important that we prepare shoes for the Spring Prayer first, so Sister Myne will need long horse leather boots.”\n\n\n “Then we’ll go with white leather,” Delia gave her input.\n\n\n “Delia, think about it. Sister Myne will have to walk throughout farming towns for the Spring Prayer. Using a darker colour would be better for this occasion.”\n\n\n Rosina and Delia started discussing it between themselves and I hadn’t got the chance to say my input. Fran listened to them with a frigid expression because I told him to look after them.\n\n\n Delia preferred cute and pretty things, she liked it more extravagant. She would always go crazy about shopping. If she were to make the final call, the shoes would definitely be too bling.\n\n\n Conversely, Rosina had a good fashion sense, her experience as Sister Christine’s attendant helped as she knew what I would need, but she did not have a sound judgement in handling money. If she followed Sister Christine’s way of thinking, she would just buy things according to her mood without holding back, and I would go broke. And of course, the things she was requesting for were increasing. From “These look quite nice” and “Since the shoemakers are here, we might as well order these too.”\n\n\n In the end, Fran had to step in to stop their crazy antics.\n\n\n “Delia, please do not go overboard with the decorations. Rosina, Sister Myne will grow, so it is illogical to order these many shoes. A better decision would be to order more shoes as she grows older.”\n\n\n Fran had served the High Priest, so he knew how many clothing items I needed to order according to society’s standards. However, both Fran and the High Priest were guys, so they lacked the sense to appreciate cute and pretty things like Rosina did. So he just needed to keep Delia and Rosina in rein when making important decisions, and all I had to do was make the final decision.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, are these fine?”\n\n\n “Yes, I think three pairs will do fine.”\n\n\n After all that, we decided to order a pair of thick and high horse leather boots that went up to my knees and a pair of soft ankle pig leather boots. Both of them will be used for the Spring Prayers. As for the final pair, it was a fancier cloth one for indoor use at the temple and in the Noble’s District.\n\n\n After finalising the order and just went the shoemaker was about to leave, Benno approached me.\n\n\n “Pardon me, but I will need to discuss an important matter with Sister Myne. Fran, may I request that you escort these two to the gates?”\n\n\n “Delia can do that instead, Fran, please tell Delia to guide these men out. Rosina, please brew some tea.”\n\n\n Fran gave a nod to Benno, before instructing Delia what to do. She was beaming with excitement on the way out, she was in a good mood because of all that shopping.\n\n\n “So, what did you need to speak with me about?”\n\n\n “Sister Myne, Johann recently came by the store. He has finished the request you sent.”\n\n\n My eyes fluttered with surprise. I became Johann’s (a young smity) patron last autumn. His Ierherl apprenticeship required him to complete a task, and I made an order with him to make multiple sets of metal letter pieces.\n\n\n “Hm? Um… Benno. You meant the request to make the metal letters, right? Um… I didn’t expect him to finish them this fast.”\n\n\n The set includes both the uppercase and lowercase of the thirty five letters in the alphabet, I made a request to Johann to make fifty types of every vowel and twenty for each consonant. He hit the ball out of the park, I totally didn’t expect him to finish them over winter.\n\n\n “He has made a request for you to check them, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n After all, the task that Ieherl smiths needed to finish was still an order made by a customer. It was an unwritten rule that they present the final product to the customer for their evaluation.\n\n\n “For convenience, it would be better for you to meet them at the store, but since that’s not possible, would you prefer that I bring Johann and his foreman here?”\n\n\n “…I will need to consult the High Priest’s about it first.”\n\n\n “Ok then.”\n\n\n Damuel and the High Priest were very mindful about people entering my chambers, so I needed to receive their approval about it first.\n\n\n “Johann has been informed that you cannot visit the store as long as it snows, so please approach the matter with care and make sure the High Priest is informed about all matters.”\n\n\n So he basically meant: I swear, you better talk to the High Priest.\n\n\n With that, I immediately sent a letter to meet the High Priest. He was almost done with all the work that piled up over the winter, he was probably quite free now so he quickly arranged a date to meet.\n\n\n “Um, High Priest. Would it be fine for me to invite a smith named Johann and his foreman to my chambers?”\n\n\n “…Since you address him by his name, I assume that he is an acquaintance.”\n\n\n “That’s right. I am his patron and I will need to review my order.”\n\n\n The High Priest nodded, and tapped his finger gently on his temples. “Myne, is this smith aware that you are an apprentice blue shrine maiden?”\n\n\n “No, not yet. Since Johann had misunderstood that I was Benno’s daughter, it is likely that Benno had not told him anything about me yet.”\n\n\n “I see. If that’s so, he cannot enter the temple. Visiting Benno’s store directly would be a better choice.”\n\n\n “But the shoemaker could come, why can’t Johann?” I tilted my head and asked in confusion.\n\n\n The High Priest sighed.\n\n\n “The shoemaker was invited to the chambers of an apprentice blue shrine maiden with Gilberta Company’s referral. But Johann would be invited here by Myne under the Gilberta Company to check her order.”\n\n\n “…Ah.” I covered my mouth with my hand.\n\n\n The High Priest narrowed his eyes.\n\n\n “I tried to investigate you from various places during the winter, and Benno seems to have done a good job hiding you. The number of people who know that the child from Gilberta Company and the temple’s new apprentice blue shrine maiden is the same person as few. Needless to say, very few people know your true identity.”\n\n\n Now that he said it, I did remember Benno chastising me to stay as inconspicuous as possible in public. Since the High Priest’s investigation revealed to him that I was well-hidden, Benno must have exerted lots of effort to do so.\n\n\n “You are allowed to visit the store. I prefer that you do not announce your position as a blue shrine maiden to everyone.”\n\n\n “Ok then, I’ll go to the Gilberta Company.”\n\n\n My face was twitching to make a smile of relief at the thought of possibly being able to leave the temple, but I did my best to hold back my emotions so that I could keep my composure like a dignified noble. Unfortunately, the High Priest dismissed my efforts with a single remark:\n\n\n “That impatient grin of yours is really unpleasant and disturbing.”\n\n\n “Damuel, you will continue to protect Myne outside the temple. Myne, you will need to ride a carriage to the store. Do not idly walk outside. You may ask Benno to prepare one. Also do your best to stay out of sight when in public.”\n\n\n “Got it, I’ll be careful!”\n\n\n My head shook up and down repeatedly at the High Priest’s nagging, and I gave up trying to hide my smile.\n\n\n Hold on, my precious little letter pieces! I’ll be seeing you as fast as I can!\n\n\n Of course, it was not like I could head over straight away. I needed to inform Lutz who was working in the orphanage to convey the message to Benno so that he can prepare a carriage.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n Benno met and arranged a meeting between me and the smithy. The meeting might be delayed because the carriage could not travel in the bad weather and heavy snowstorm.\n\n\n “If the letter pieces are what I need then I’ll need to arrange for blank and symbol types to be made too. Maybe I should write the orders for them now.”\n\n\n I prepared the next order before the date of the meeting, as well as the things I might need there. If there was a chance, I would like to demonstrate the printing process there.\n\n\n “Maybe I should take the ink, paper, baren, and rag too, just in case. Might as well show them how to use the letter pieces. Fran, please tell Gil get what I need from the workshop.”\n\n\n “Understood.”\n\n\n “Um, Sister Myne. May I ask, why are you bothering to visit the lower-city?” Delia looked completely shocked when she saw me chatting so happily with Fran about what I would require for the meeting.\n\n\n I just grinned back since I was completely clueless how much information Delia had given to the High Bishop. “I’ll be reviewing some goods, afterall I am someone who converses in the arts.”\n\n\n ~~\n\n\n For this trip, Damuel, Fran and Lutz, who for some reason saw Lutz as a rival, were accompanying me. Lutz was constantly jabbering how it was one of his responsibilities as the overseer of the workshop to assist with businesses with the Gilberta Company as well. Maybe I should just give a short explanation on how the letter pieces work since I am not allowed to do any work myself, after that I would let Gil take over.\n\n\n The four of us sat inside the bumpy carriage Benno arranged for and set off from the Gilberta Company. Damuel scrunched his face the moment we passed the temple gate because of the putrid smell. It appears that he had never been to the lower city.\n\n\n “What on earth is this horrible smell?”\n\n\n “It’s just the smell here in the lower city. You have no choice but to get used to it.”\n\n\n That’s the reaction of someone who has only been to the embellished Noble’s District and the neat temple. I can relate, really.\n\n\n My reaction had probably been the same the first time I stepped out to the lower city as Myne. But I didn’t take long to adjust and accept it as a part of everyday life here. Humans were adaptable creatures, it surprised me how easily we could adapt and endure almost everything\n\n\n “Sir Damuel, I’m afraid this part of the task given to you by the High Priest. You will need to continue protecting me in the lower-city.”\n\n\n “Ah, that seems so. That will be a tough job.”\n\n\n When we got to the Gilberta Company, Damuel’s face was still twisted up. Mark came out of the store’s front entrance to meet us.\n\n\n “Thank you for blessing our humble store with your grace, Lady Myne. Everyone has arrived and is waiting for you inside.”\n\n\n “Hello, Mark. I am happy to have received your welcome.”\n\n\n “Apprentice, your hand.”\n\n\n Damuel extended his hand as if it was an expected thing, but I was stumped. A rich girl would usually allow him to escort her down the carriage, but I was not experienced enough to graciously be escorted.\n\n\n The steps on the side of the carriage were narrow and the gap between them was big for me. Even with Damuel’s help, I might still fall down.\n\n\n “Sir Damuel, Sister Myne is not big enough to be escorted down.”\n\n\n Fran took the initiative to tell Damuel what was going on and carried me down while I stood transfixed with a cold perspiration stuck to my back.\n\n\n “Ah, of course. Apologies, apprentice. I am not used to tending to little ones so I am not sure how I can escort them.”\n\n\n “All is well, Sir Damuel. I am the one who should grow up faster so that I can be escorted down.”\n\n\n But becoming a proper lady is not an easy task, so much so that I don’t know if I’ll be one when I am an adult…I thought all of these to myself as we entered the store, and Mark walked us to the familiar office.\n\n\n “Master Benno, Lady Myne has arrived.”\n\n\n Inside the room, was Johann, the smith foreman, Benno, and Lutz who had been waiting.\n\n\n “I hope the wait has not been too long,” I said when I entered the office.\n\n\n Johann and his foreman both gasped when I walked in. I was not surprised that they got a shock. I was unlike my usual relaxed and typical self, instead, I was now speaking formally with three companions behind.\n\n\n “Thank you for coming, Lady Myne.” Benno greeted me, and Johann and the foreman stumbled to do the same.\n\n\n Fran had pulled back a chair for me, I took a seat in it and smiled at Johann who was across from me.\n\n\n “Good morning, Johann. I was informed that you had completed the order I assigned to you.”\n\n\n “Yes, but…” Johann glanced nervously at the three people trailing behind me.\n\n\n His foreman placed two boxes wrapped in a cloth each on the table. I heard the sound of metal hitting each other inside the box. I was getting excited from just the sound they made.\n\n\n “We couldn’t fit all of them in a box because it would be too heavy, so we had them split into two.”\n\n\n To make letter pieces, it first starts with making the letter punches. They were hard metal devices with a letter symbol protrusion, the protrusion were made from filing and chiseling. Making one alone required lots of skills, so that the piece of metal could be carved and filed to a single centimeter in width and height. All of this could only be done by Johann who was a master in precision work.\n\n\n After making the letter punch, it would be pressed into a softer metal to create a matrix, that was the name of the mold used in letterpress printing to print a letter. After the letter punch has made an imprint on the matrix, you would have to put the matrix in a mold and pour alloy in the same mold. After the alloy cools and hardens, it will form a metal letter that looks exactly like that made from the letter punch. The mold is reused to repetitively make more metal types of that same letter. This whole process is repeated to make multiple identical sets of letters.\n\n\n “I was surprised to learn that you finished making them. I didn’t expect them to be done this fast…”\n\n\n Just looking at the cloth wrapped boxes gave me an amazing rush of exhilaration in my chest. I felt the blood gush into my head, I sighed with bliss as I pressed my hand against my racing heart. I peered at the cloth, as if I could look through it and the box, it felt as though I were Juliet looking for her long-lost Romeo.\n\n\n Johann scratched his cheek and laughed a bit embarrassedly, oblivious to my haste. “…Everyone pitched in a little because they enjoyed the challenge.”\n\n\n Johann was the maker of the letter punches and matrices, but the other craftsmen who were bored because they had nothing at hand for the winter, assisted him in mass-producing the letter pieces…\n\n\n The foreman gave a mighty grin and slapped Johann’s back.\n\n\n “We competed over who poured the alloy the best and discussed ways to speed it up and we went crazy with laughter that this task was too hard for a leherl. We’d chuckle and say, ‘Of course the only patron who would patronise Johann would order something like this.’ Vulcanift, the God of Smithing, has truly blessed him!”\n\n\n The foreman had said all that to tease Johann, but it did seem that he truly believed that Vulcanift the God of Smithing had arranged my meeting with Johann. My order needed precision, and Johann was perfect for the job. It was mutual that I was immensely grateful that we had crossed paths.\n\n\n “We all worked hard to make these letter thingies. Johann, let her see them.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir.”\n\n\n Johann loosened and removed the cloth at the foreman’s order. It unraveled two small boxes , each were the size of an A4-sized paper. Inside it was lined with silver metal pieces that despite their boring appearance, they twinkled and glittered when the light reflected off their carved surfaces. It was quite overwhelming for me to see all of the letters placed before me.\n\n\n “Amazing…”\n\n\n My hands trembled with awe when I picked up one of the letter pieces. It was a thin layer of metal, sized 2.5 cm on all sides, and a letter shape was imprinted into one side. Despite its small size, the metal was quite heavy, and I lifted it up to examine it from all sides.\n\n\n I picked another one and placed them next to each other. I squinted my eyes while I checked for any height differences. Any dissimilarity in height would have a significant impact on printing. Thankfully, the pieces were all the same height, which was more than I could ever wish for. A smile had unknowingly formed on my face.\n\n\n “How is it, miss? Are they what you want?”\n\n\n I regained myself when I heard the foreman’s voice… When I turned around, I noticed Johann waiting impatiently and nervously for my reviewsl. Satisfied with this, I glanced back between Johann and the boxes, giving a firm nod while holding a letter type.\n\n\n “They’re amazing! You really are a Gutenberg!”\n\n\n “Ah?”\n\n\n “Johann, I dub thee ‘Gutenberg’!”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n Everyone gawked at me with a bamboozled face. Except for Lutz, who had gone absolutely pale and ran over to shake my shoulders\n\n\n He exclaimed, “Calm down, Myne!”\n\n\n I glared back at him while remaining seated. “How can I be calm?! We’re talking about Gutenberg here!”\n\n\n “Idiot, you’re getting too emotional!”\n\n\n Lutz was losing it a little, but there was no way I could keep my cool with a complete set of letter pieces before me. Nah-ah.\n\n\n “You’re not giving the proper reaction, Lutz. You know, this is going to change history. Doesn’t that thrill you? Enough to make your head hurt? Come on, just show your emotions! Let us relish in these bliss!”\n\n\n “Sorry, Myne, but I don’t get it.”\n\n\n Lutz didn’t seem to get why I was so happy. I looked around and noticed that everyone else was equally perplexed, as if they had no idea what was going on. Was this not a depressing scene that I was the only one in the room who was excited?\n\n\n “But, this marks the start of the printing era! You’re now witnessing a historical moment here!”\n\n\n I made a clatter as I stood up, trying my best to enthusiastically expound the magnificence of the letter pieces, but the response was just mediocre.\n\n\n “This is the rebirth of Gutenberg! The first’s given name was Johannes, and from today onwards he will go by the name Johann! What an amazing coincidence! A once-in-a-lifetime chance encounter! Praise thee gods!” I raised my arms into the praying pose, but Lutz just held his head\n\n\n “Um, miss? Who’s this ‘Gutenberg’ you keep mentioning?” asked the smithy foreman with a confused face.\n\n\n Glad that someone was finally making an effort to understand, I slapped my hands together and turned to him.\n\n\n “Gutenberg is a famous craftsman on par with a god, whose work forever reshaped history and the world of books. Johann is, without a doubt, the city’s Gutenberg!”\n\n\n Just as I was getting into explaining, I remembered that you needed other things than letter pieces when it came to printing. Paper, ink and a printing press were needed too. Maybe that was why everyone’s reaction was so underwhelming, it’s because I was giving all the credit to just Johann.\n\n\n “…Oh, I see. Lots of people contributed to this, those who make the ink, making the letter press, Benno making the paper and Lutz who sells the books. It was wrong of me to leave the others out. I see, I see. Apologies, all of you are Gutenberg. All of you are part of the Gutenberg family!”\n\n\n “You can leave me out of that family.” Benno quickly refused our camaraderie.\n\n\n “What are you saying, Benno?! That’s not respectful to the Gutenbergs, who will lead the world in printing books! This is something to be happy about, no kidding. Your heart needs to be on the verge of bursting with joy. All right?”\n\n\n Benno looked at me with frustration and defeat before looking at Lutz. Lutz waved his hand back to signal his defeat too and sighed.\n\n\n “Since the letter pieces are done, we can start working on the printing press! Let’s go ahead and place an order with the woodworking business now. Haaa, we’re finally going to start printing! Yes! Indeed yes!! Praise thee Metisonora, the Goddess of Wisdom.!”\n\n\n I went into the praying stance again, causing my excitement to peak so much that I passed out."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n When I woke up, I had a long schedule of lectures awaiting me. First came Lutz and Benno, then Fran and Gil, and then Damuel and the High Priest. Why are there more people in my life scolding me now?\n\n\n … But like seriously, can they stop using the excuse of “visiting the sick” to scold me in bed. I want to sleep.\n\n\n Damuel gave the longest and most passionate speech this time. After my sudden collapse, he was apparently scared that the High Priest would also deem him a useless knight like his previous superior did.\n\n\n “I was dead sure I was going to be killed this time! I felt like I was already dead when we carried you back,” he exclaimed fiercely, holding back his tears.\n\n\n “I’m sorry. Really. But just to give you a heads up, when we start officially printing, I might pass out from excitement quite frequently.”\n\n\n “You’re not sorry at all!”\n\n\n “I apologise that I’m not strong enough to stop my fainting spells.”\n\n\n “Not that! You don’t need to be sorry for that!”\n\n\n With everyone scolding me 24/7, everyday, it was difficult to stay enthusiastic for the letter pieces, and thus my fever subsided quickly. Even after my recovery, the lectures persisted. They kept nagging about the same times repeatedly that it was getting rather dull. I only wanted to get home, the snow had melted enough for carriages to pass through, so it wasn’t that far off.\n\n\n “Just let me go home…”\n\n\n But before that, I needed to write a letter to seek an audience with the High Priest. But I instead got one from the High Priest who requested to meet me. But it was not so much of ‘wanting to meet me’ but more of a ‘when are you free’ letter because I was the one going over, not him coming over.\n\n\n “Fran, the High Priest rarely writes me a letter, something important must be going on. I would like to see him as soon as possible— no wait, I would like to head over today, but I don’t know what I should say to him.”\n\n\n “It would be inconvenient for his attendants if you visited so suddenly. I would suggest that you visit tomorrow,” Fran gave a slight smile.\n\n\n And so I wrote a reply that I would be available tomorrow.\n\n\n “Should I get him a present or something? After all, he did come to see me when I was sick.”\n\n\n The High Priest gave me lots of food as get-well gifts, but I wasn’t in need of it because the snow was thawing, meaning I would be returning home shortly. As of now, I planned to relocate half of it to the girls’ building’s basement storage.\n\n\n “You can try some of the sweets you have made here. In fact, your cookies were well-received by the High Priest.”\n\n\n “How about the caramel custard I tried making recently?”\n\n\n When Tuuli visited, I tried making both caramel custard and ice cream. But it ended up with a warm warning that ice cream is best enjoyed for warm weather. Of course, ice cream was nice in heated homes from modern times, but having it in front of the fireplace just made one feel cold and the taste dull, your body would just go cold.\n\n\n “Hmm… Sure, the caramel custard is nice, but you can only enjoy it after you have gotten used to its texture. First-timers might find it somewhat weird… The custard might not be a good idea for first-timers.”\n\n\n Steaming was not a known cooking method here, I made this assumption based on Lutz’s reaction to the steamed potatoffels. Ella was taken aback with making the caramel custard, and those who tried it raved about the texture and was concerned how it crumbled apart before it entered their mouth. Regardless, it was still well-received because it was sweet and tasty…\n\n\n “If that’s so, we can ask Ella if she can make the cookies the High Priest likes.”\n\n\n I decided on the cookies. The flavours chosen were my preferred, the plain and tea ones.\n\n\n After that was taken care of, I began working on the plans for the printing press. If my memory serves me correctly, the first printing presses on Earth were modified grape presses, so I doubt they were that hard to make. It was just that I struggled to recall its measurements, let alone how it looked like.\n\n\n “Huh… I think it needs some tool to apply the ink? Maybe it was a handle like this, the leather pulls out like this… with something to hold it down with the paper… Did the letter pieces get lined up here?”\n\n\n I combed through my memories furiously, but to no avail as the blueprints were barely piecing up. I was unable to give a precise blueprint, but it was possible for me to give a rough idea upfront. These notes and ideas will have to be noted out so that I could experiment with them with letter press.\n\n\n Maybe I could ask the High Priest to use the memory searching tool on me again. I mumbled to myself as I worked on the blueprint, my attendants worked around me to complete their tasks to their best.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n “Good morning, High Priest,” I greeted and presented him with my gift.\n\n\n “This wasn’t necessary,” he said, his face devoid of any reaction as he received them. It was impossible for me to tell if he was happy about it or not.\n\n\n “Arno.”\n\n\n Arno went over at the High Priest’s instructions and placed a dish on the table. Fran took the cookies out of the bag and piled them up. He took out the cup he brought from my chamber and handed it to Arno who filled it up with tea along with the High Priest’s…\n\n\n “Feel free to do so, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n Arno placed the cookie platter in front of me. I stared at the High Priest, unsure what I was supposed to do.\n\n\n “When giving food as a gift, it is customary for the gifter to eat it first to ensure that it is not poisoned. I take it that you did not know of this, so I figured I might as well teach it to you now.”\n\n\n Poison testing…? Um, that’s scary.\n\n\n I had no qualms about eating the cookies since they were mine, having to hear about food being poisoned made me anxious about consuming anything outside my chambers.\n\n\n “Likewise, the host will also drink the tea first.”\n\n\n I took a bit of my cookies and the High Priest drank his tea that was brewed from the same pot as mine did. We each continued at our leisure after the testing was done.\n\n\n Fran had got it right when he mentioned that the High Priest enjoyed the cookies. His face remained expressionless, but the cookies vanished the quickest out of anything else on the table.\n\n\n We talked about random topics from the weather to the orphanage’s situation. After we finished our tea, the discussion turned to the main topic.\n\n\n I think I can pass off as a noble now. I hope so. I would like to think so.\n\n\n “Um, High Priest. Since I’m returning home soon, so I was hoping—”\n\n\n “No.”\n\n\n My words were cut off by the High Priest who clanked his teacup back on its plate.\n\n\n “Bwuh?”\n\n\n I tilted my head to the side, perplexed why the High Priest refused to let me return when the snow was beginning to thaw. He pushed his chair back as he got up. He gave a quick scan of his room and proceeded to the hidden room next to his bed.\n\n\n “Follow me.”\n\n\n He did not want his attendants hearing the reason why. So I moved accordingly as well - I placed my cup down, stood up and walked to the opened door to the hidden room.\n\n\n When I was in, I saw on the familiar bench and he sat in the usual chair.\n\n\n “So it’s about something you’re attendants can’t hear?”\n\n\n “…Yes. It would be preferable for less to know about this.” The High Priest took in a deep breath and continued. “I just received news that Wolf has died unexpectedly. It occurred shortly after I made a request to Karstedt to investigate him”\n\n\n I swallowed when he said ‘died’. But my head was still cocked to the side, because I was confused about an important detail.\n\n\n Um… Who’s Wolf?\n\n\n “You look befuddled.”\n\n\n “Um, High Priest. I know this sounds ridiculous, but who is Wolf? The name sounds familiar, but I can’t quite put my finger on it…”\n\n\n The fact that I couldn’t put a face to his name indicated that he wasn’t someone I knew. I knew he was significant because the High Priest talked about him as if he were someone I knew, but I still couldn’t recall who he was.\n\n\n The eyes of the High Priest widened in shock before he let out a long sigh. “Wolf is the Ink Guild’s guildmaster.”\n\n\n “Oh, that shady man?”\n\n\n I’d been imprisoned at the temple all winter because the leader of the Ink Guild approached Lutz and tried uncovering information on me.\n\n\n “Wait… He’s dead?! When, what, how?!”\n\n\n “Your reaction is too delayed!”\n\n\n Apparently, Wolf was under investigation by Karstedt and the High Priest, to see if the rumour circulating him was fact or fiction, and to figure out who had ordered him to look into me. However, before they could pinpoint a suspect, Wolf died.\n\n\n “Wolf had heard from somewhere that a shrine maiden who was a commoner, was also acting as a forewoman.”\n\n\n Since he emphasized the word “somewhere”, I remembered that very few nobles knew my true identity. Not many nobles here could have had such knowledge about me.\n\n\n “Wolf was looking into who was the forewoman and if she had any ties to Benno. However, just when he was about to start the investigation, you fled inside the temple, and your health has minimised your interaction with others outside. Needless to say, his investigation was not fruitful.”\n\n\n What the High Priest said gave me a fright. Nobles had ordered Wolf to look into me, but the investigation did not cover much and he was under the scrutiny of Karstedt and the High Priest. He ended up dead after all that, so it didn’t take long for me to piece it together.\n\n\n “…Was Wolf killed by the noble?”\n\n\n The High Priest nodded with certainty. “Most definitely.”\n\n\n “…Are the nobles targeting me?”\n\n\n Commoners meant nothing to the nobles, nobles ruthlessly killed anyone who stood in their way. Even though that was a fact I knew, having it happen so abruptly and close to me made me frightened. I crossed my arms and rubbed my arms covered with goosebumps.\n\n\n “Is the noble after me?”\n\n\n “There is no question that a number of nobles are after you, but we have no idea who they are or what they are after. And I think few would know too,” he replied with a solemn voice that made me shudder.\n\n\n “When the Spring Prayer begins, the nobles in charge of the rural towns will leave together. Our biggest concern is you being kidnapped out from the city, therefore you must remain in the temple until their numbers have dwindled. With less of them, it will be much easier to determine their allegiance and motives.”\n\n\n Well, the only good thing is that he didn’t say I couldn’t return home.\n\n\n I had no choice but to sadly agree to extend my stay in the temple. I did my best to comfort myself. The High Priest was relieved that I had agreed easily and took out a small palm-sized item.\n\n\n “I will need to talk to your family about the extension and adoption. Give them this.”\n\n\n “…Yes.”\n\n\n This would be a serious topic, of me getting adopted by a noble, so there was no way I could casually bring it up whenever Tuuli or Dad visited. I had intended to bring it up when I got home, but High Priest plans to tell it to them while I was still here. I faced down as I studied the letter of invitation the High Priest gave me.\n\n\n “You probably know this, but you are not to tell anyone about Wolf or your adoption. Your attendants are no exception,” he instructed and Delia popped into my mind, so I did not argue back.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n I had Fran summon Lutz immediately when I returned to my chambers so I could hand him the letter. He agreed to pass it over, but he seemed perplexed as to what bad things I had done that the High Priest had to summon them over. The only thing I could tell him was that I was staying until the end of the Spring Prayer. It was ok to tell this much information. Or at least, I had to tell that to everyone around me, including my attendants, if I didn’t want to cause any confusion\n\n\n “How about our food?” Delia asked when she heard my conversation with Lutz.\n\n\n I just smiled back and said, “It won’t be long till the market opens, plus we still have food leftover from the High Priest.”\n\n\n So that was why the High Priest gave us food, it was so that we could last in the temple even after winter ended."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Three days after Lutz gave the letter, my parents came to the waiting room by the temple gates. It was the first time I had seen my mum in a while. Her familiar smile and big belly (it was so big that she might go into labour any moment now) welled up feelings of joy in me.\n\n\n “Mum…”\n\n\n “Sister Myne, you are not in your chambers. I know how you are feeling, but please remember your current situation.”\n\n\n Fran gently held me back with a guilty expression. Mom drew her hand back, and Dad soothed her by wrapping an arm over her shoulders.\n\n\n “Please follow me.”\n\n\n Fran walked in front of us and I followed close behind. Damuel was beside me, with my parents trailing behind.\n\n\n When a hand gently caressed my hair (a hand that was gentler than Dad), I fought the urge to turn around and continued walking. I couldn’t stop grinning.\n\n\n When I tried to turn around, the hand squeezed me as if telling me to look forward. I found it hilarious that the hand kept retreating back whenever Fran looked back. The gentle hand would occasionally swap out for a larger one. This was how our silent interaction went until we reached the High Priest’s chambers.\n\n\n “Good morning, High Priest,” Mum greeted…\n\n\n “You called for us, sire?” Dad saluted the High Priest.\n\n\n The High Priest nodded back and gestured them to their seats. One side of the table was a bench, and there were two chairs across it. Noting our statuses right now, my parents would sit on the bench, me and the High Priest would take the chairs. My mum had some difficulty sitting on the bench because of her belly, so Dad offered her a hand as they sat down together.\n\n\n “The rest of you, please take your leave.”\n\n\n Once his attendant had poured us tea, the High Priest had everyone else leave the room. He also soundproofed the area around the table with a magic tool.\n\n\n Dad got a shock and looked around. “What the…?”\n\n\n “This is to soundproof our voices to the outside. Since it’s just us, Myne, you may go to your parents. I’m sure you must have tried your best to hold back the entire time.\n\n\n The High Priest gently nudged me towards my parents after explaining the purpose of the magic barrier. I had been standing the entire time because I was unsure where I should have sat…\n\n\n “Thank you so much, High Priest.” I smiled and thanked him\n\n\n I jumped into the seat between my parents, and looked at them before giving Mum a big.\n\n\n “It’s nice seeing you again, Mum. I missed you so much. Seems like the baby is going to pop out any time now!”\n\n\n “Not yet. The baby still has to get a little bigger,” Mom said while hugging me.\n\n\n I rubbed her belly and sighed in content…\n\n\n “…I see that you have been satisfied. Shall I start?”\n\n\n “Yes, please.” I sat up and looked across the table at the High Priest.\n\n\n “Very well. We’ll skip the bothersome introductions and jump straight in”\n\n\n Because of his time with me, the High Priest had that there was no point in doing the usual noble greetings with commoners, so he didn’t do all the long greetings he did with Karstedt.\n\n\n “Myne will stay in the temple until the end of Spring Prayer.”\n\n\n “Wait a second. Why? We only agreed that she would stay till winter ended” Dad tilted forward with his breath caught in his throat.\n\n\n The High Priest gave him a cold glance and kept an indifferent look. “She is in greater danger than she had ever been.”\n\n\n That short response was enough to tell Dad that things were getting beyond him. He lowered his gaze and used his other hand to grasp his fist.\n\n\n “Danger?”\n\n\n “Myne has more mana than we could have ever imagined. This mana is vital to the city because of the shortage we are facing. As such, some nobles want her, while others wish for her demise.\n\n\n He said that nobles had set their sights on me for a variety of reasons. I could feel Mom and Dad’s hands shaking on my back, and watched the colour drain from their faces.\n\n\n “The worst that could happen is Myne getting kidnapped and taken away from the city. As a result, several adjustments to the regulations nobles need to undergo when entering the city have been made. As a soldier at the gates, I’m sure you’re aware of this, Gunther.”\n\n\n Dad’s eyes widened at the current topic of the conversation, but he did his best to stay calm. “Yes… I am aware. For the nobles to enter, the Knight’s Order has implemented some rules.”\n\n\n “Yes, because if Myne were to be kidnapped, it would most certainly be by a noble. We will not know if it will be a noble from this duchy or another, so we had to get the Knights Order involved and urged the archduke to limit nobles’ access to the city.”\n\n\n Karstedt and the High Priest appeared to have been working hard behind the scenes.\n\n\n “All of these have been done for Myne?” Dad was dumbfounded.\n\n\n “Of course there are other reasons, but one of them was for Myne’s safety. I will not speak of anything else other than this. This reason should be enough for you, I hope.”\n\n\n Dad nodded as he loosened up a little.\n\n\n “When Spring Prayer comes, nobles with ruling territory will return to their lands. With fewer nobiles in the city, keeping tabs on them will be an easier task. I respectfully suggest that you live separately until then. All of this is to keep Myne safe.”\n\n\n The High Priest’s word had a calm but definitive power to it. It was reasonable to say he was a natural leader. After all, he was once the Knight’s Order’s commander.\n\n\n Dad’s soldier instincts clicked in and he saluted.\n\n\n “Thank you for all of your hard work. But why are you doing this for Myne…?”\n\n\n “Did I not emphasize how valuable her mana is? She must be protected at all costs. The High Priest sighed in irritation, “We would not have gone to such exhausting lengths if she just agreed to be adopted.”\n\n\n “Adoption?!” yelled Dad who had his eyes stretched all the way. My mother strengthened her grip on my hand.\n\n\n “What do you say to this, Gunther, will you approve of Myne’s adoption?”\n\n\n Dad’s teeth were grinding together and Mum gripped on tighter that my hand started to hurt, it felt as though she was saying she will never let me go again. They said nothing, but their answer was clear as day.\n\n\n “Like parents like daughter…” The High Priest tapped his head with his finger and spoke to himself “To hope that her parents would give in… ” before looking back up at us.\n\n\n Myne shared the same sentiments too, no matter what she refused to leave her family. We agreed that we could wait till she turns ten. She has way more mana than what was expected from a commoner with Devouring. Hence a noble will adopt her when she turns ten. This is absolute. “\n\n\n “What…?!”\n\n\n My parents froze, as though they had been shot. They had no say, they were basically told that no matter what they said, the adoption would still go through. They seemed unsure how they should react to the High Priest’s actions, he was obviously trying to protect me, but at the same time he was breaking us apart.\n\n\n “A person who cannot control their mana will only pose a threat to themselves and everyone else. If they are seen as a threat to the city’s peace and well-being, execution is imminent.”\n\n\n “Execution?!”\n\n\n “The protectors of the city must eliminate those who pose a danger to others. As a soldier, I think you would know that better.”\n\n\n Dad struggled to imagine that his daughter was that dangerous, he looked dazed and Mum just gripped my hand tighter that it started to hurt. The High Priest continued to look at them with an indifferent expression, making his emotions untellable, he resumed his vague explanation of the situation.\n\n\n “The only way to avoid her execution is for her to gain control of her own mana. Thereby the adoption is needed. She may continue to live with you until she is ten, but by then she will have to leave for the Royal Academy. There will be no negotiations then. Adoption or execution. The decision lies in your hands\n\n\n “Ten years old…” Dad muttered the deadline with despair, we would only have two years tops left together.\n\n\n A soft sigh escaped from the High Priest’s mouth. “A respectable noble will adopt Myne, he is someone who I have placed my utmost faith and confidence in. He will not mistreat her. I assure you.”\n\n\n My mother’s head sprang up as soon as he said that. She nodded while giving a firm look into the High Priest in the eyes.\n\n\n “Understood. Please look after Myne for us.”\n\n\n “Effa?!” Dad exclaimed in shock. But Mom ignored him and kept her stare onto the High Priest.\n\n\n “When I came to know of Myne’s stay in the temple for the winter, I was worried that her poort health would have made it difficult for her. Yet Tuuli has informed me that Myne was fine due to everyone’s care and guidance. I strongly believe that that was thanks to your hardwork, High Priest.”\n\n\n She was aware that I made it through the winter without being sick in bed the entire time because everyone had properly cared for me the entire time.\n\n\n “Effa, you… It’s not like I don’t understand the circumstances, but adoption is—”\n\n\n Dad wanted to make another point, but he quickly shut up when Mum raised her hand towards him. I saw her look downwards before shaking her head slowly…\n\n\n “Enough, Gunther. Please reconsider this. Remember that many children will move out from home when they reach ten years of age to become an Ieherl? There is no way I will let Myne get executed for being dangerous. If a noble who doesn’t know her well kidnaps her, I can’t imagine the danger she would be in. The High Priest has treated Myne well. If we had to give her up, at least be someone I can trust.”\n\n\n Mum turned back to the High Priest and hugged herself.\n\n\n “High Priest, look after Myne for us, please.”\n\n\n Dad stopped resisting with Mum’s words. His back dropped in despair, after a while he straightened up to salute by tapping his right hand against his left chest twice. My parents had given their approval for my adoption when I turned ten.\n\n\n “I don’t want to be ten…”\n\n\n I knew that whatever had just unfolded was for my sake, but I still felt an unbearable amount of despair stab into my heart. I hugged Mum as long as possible, wishing that the warmth would wipe off the depressing feelings that overwhelmed me."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The temperature outside was increasing, and almost half of the snow in the city had melted. The thickest of winter was over, and everyone worked together to shovel the snow in anticipation of sprint’s arrival. Since Tuuli had to resume work, the times she could visit me lessened down to alternate days.\n\n\n With Lutz as the middleman, all of the orphanage wintercraft was sold to Benno. The money earnt would help ease the orphanage’s financial situation.\n\n\n There was too much snow in the forest, but it would not be long till the snow melts away and we can resume collecting wood to make paper.\n\n\n Until then the orphanage would focus on studying, gray priests with past experience as attendants would be in charge of teaching the children proper manners. Apparently, the gray priests were worried that I was setting a bad example to the children. Because they always spoke casually to me, they feared that they would act improperly to the other blue priests too. All the lessons were held in the dining hall, so the workshop was empty, except for me, Lutz and Damiel.\n\n\n “I plan to use the printing press for the next edition of books, at most, I would like to have the texts printed.” I said\n\n\n “I’m cool with that,” replied Lutz. “But we don’t have the printing press ready yet”\n\n\n “Hmm… My plan was to just modify the press we already made.”\n\n\n I dug out my rough drawings and passed them to Lutz. I vaguely recalled that the first printing press by Gutenberg was based on grape presses for making wine. I had some confidence that I could copy it a little, but I was struggling to pull it out from my memory.\n\n\n “Put the letter pieces like that, paint on the ink, put the paper below… and you press it down.”\n\n\n I attempted to describe how to use the press with my hands (since I couldn’t use the actual press because I was too short). I was stuck in the temple so it was up to Lutz to order the stuff we needed and to pass the messages to the workshops.\n\n\n “Guess we’ll have to decide on how big the thing where you lay out the types—the, uh… forme1? Yeah, how big the forme will be,” said Lutz.\n\n\n “We need to write down how big we should make the thing that holds the letter pieces… uh, the forme? How big should the forme be?”\n\n\n “We’ll make it according to the books we already have.”\n\n\n I used the ruler to measure the necessary stuff and wrote it onto my blueprint, while continuing my discussion with Lutz. I made a list of things to note for, like “make the board to hold the paper slanted” and “needs a holder for the ink”.\n\n\n Lutz read it all and shook his head.\n\n\n “Uhm, Myne. Can’t we just do all that extra stuff later?”\n\n\n “Extra? But these are all necessary.”\n\n\n Knowing myself best, I knew I had forgotten more than I remembered, and there were probably some unnecessary things I wrote down subconsciously. But Lutz just took his head again at my words.\n\n\n “Not that,” he pointed to a part of the blueprint. “I understand why we need a place to hold the ink, but I can tell you’re not even sure where to put it. So why don’t we just keep the ink separate on another table?”\n\n\n There was nothing for me to object about that. We just needed to include these important parts; a forme for the letter pieces underneath the press. Other than that we only needed to do the minimum, even if doing the minimum would slow down the printing.\n\n\n “You’re just overthinking everything because you’re only thinking about the final product. Don’t you remember how we first made paper with some random tools? We’ll just continue doing that too. We only need what is actually necessary, the rest can come later.”\n\n\n “…You’re right. Since you mentioned this, our biggest hurdle to overcome right now would be asking the craftsman to make a press for the children to use.”\n\n\n We finished up the blueprint as we talked. We finalised on a simple sketch for Ingo’s carpentry to make and the order would be sent through Benno.\n\n\n “Moving on now…”\n\n\n Since we were done with the printing press’s design, I wanted to talk about the forme and composing stick, but Gil barged into the workshop right at that moment.\n\n\n “Sister Myne!”\n\n\n “Gil, what’s up? Do I have to go to the High Priest’s room now?”\n\n\n I did not have any harspiel lessons today because my female attendants were preoccupied with the Spring Prayer preparations.\n\n\n “Nope. Rosina asked me to get you. It’s just that, she’s mad that you have only been caring about printing presses and unbothered that we’re not done with Spring Prayer preparations. I mean, she’s trying not to show it, but… she’s definitely angry.”\n\n\n Why did it seem like she was venting her anger on me because she can’t play her harpsiel and I was going around doing whatever I wanted…\n\n\n I got the impression she was simply expressing her frustrations at me since she had less time to play the harspiel, but I was free to do anything I pleased.\n\n\n “Ah, ok. Can you take the fall for me then?”\n\n\n “Sure! Wait… Wait a second. Certainly not! I don’t want to!”\n\n\n It took Gil a while to process what I said and he turned it down strongly. He acted so hilarious that me and Lutz bursted out laughing, and Gil glared back showing that he would drag me back no matter. So, it appeared that I had to subject myself to Rosina’s anger no matter what too.\n\n\n “…Oh well, looks like I have no escape now. Lutz, can you finish up the rest?”\n\n\n “Sure thing. You have important things to do, right? Good luck. You’ll definitely do well.”\n\n\n Lutz rubbed my head, but I just nodded back in dread of what was to come. I walked back to my chambers with a sulky Gil in the lead.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n I got a shock when I saw the horrible state my chambers were in. There were luggages filled with shoes, clothes and beauty equipment. They were accompanied with towels, cloths, utensils and dishes, writing tools, paper and diptychs my attendants would need.\n\n\n It felt like I was moving houses again\n\n\n The main had a few crates filled with food supplies and some empty ones that would be used to store the utensils from the kitchen needed to cook my meals for the trip (they would be packed after today’s meal).\n\n\n I walked up to the second floor to see my even more wrecked room. I saw three boxes on the floor, one each for fabric, clothes and shoes. My table had lots of items strewn across. And in the centre of all this chaos was Delia, Rosina and Rose.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, please do not leave your chambers for the workshop when preparations for the Spring Prayer are still incomplete.”\n\n\n Though Rosina had said that, I knew that they would scold me if I tried to lend a helping hand. I had been lectured constantless times that laborious work was my attendants’ responsibility, so I was not supposed to do anything. My job was just to sit, not move, and watch my attendants do the work.\n\n\n “Hey! You’re supposed to be excited about this! This is your huge responsibility, Sister Myne!”\n\n\n “…But, I already believe that everyone is capable of packing everything without my supervision.”\n\n\n “That’s not the point.”\n\n\n A few of my attendants would come along for the Spring Prayer. First was Fran since he was there with the High Priest’s past ones, then Rosina because a girl was needed to tend to me, Hugo and Ella would come too as they needed to prepare my meals. Delia, Wilma, and Gil stayed behind to man my chambers, the orphanage, and the workshop respectively. Food would be prepared for those in the temple by Todd and the other chef, with Nicola’s and Monika’s assistance (they both had been trained by Ella last winter).\n\n\n “Anyways, there’s way too many things to bring,” I muttered to myself unknowingly. There were just too many things I had stored to cover me for the winter.\n\n\n Rosina looked perplexed though. “You have much less luggage than others. Sister Christine would have 2 more boxes for her clothes, and more boxes for painting and her musical instruments.”\n\n\n Wilma agreed and continued, “Sister Christine’s preparation took much longer. Whenever she had to go to the Noble’s District, we struggled so much to pack everything.”\n\n\n Rosina’s eyes enlarged as though she remembered something significant when I was still trying to process how amazing Sister Christine had been.\n\n\n “…Sister Myne, if you don’t mind me asking. “May I also bring a harspiel?” She asked cautiously.\n\n\n I shook my head, my gaze falling on the harpiels sitting in the corner.\n\n\n “I believe it will be better to keep them here, even more so because they are not mine.”\n\n\n It was not a good idea to bring them along without permission because they were the High Priest’s. I would have to pay a hefty sum if they got damaged, missing or stolen.\n\n\n Rosina, on the other hand, was adamant about not giving up. She continued speaking as she looked at the haspiels.\n\n\n “Could you please ask the High Priest for his consent, for my sake please?”\n\n\n “No worries, I will give it a shot.”\n\n\n “Thank you so much, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n As expected, me being around had no purpose because I could not help out, so came up with an excuse that I needed to see the High Priest, and Fran and Damuel tagged along.\n\n\n “It is quite difficult to prepare for the Spring Prayer. A request from the Knight’s Order needs to be seen to immediately, but as an attendant, preparations are easy because there is not much to be done.”\n\n\n Fran said that the Spring Prayer preparation was considerably more difficult because our mode of transport was carriages, not the highbeasts we rode on previously.\n\n\n As for me, thinking about the travel there made me much more sad than the packing. I lost all of my excitement for the trip when I heard that we would ride in a carriage. That was because I knew that the travelling would drain me of all my energy before we reached the first time. I can see myself being so dead tired that I wouldn’t be able to do anything.\n\n\n “Can I just skip the whole Spring Prayer?” I let out a sigh.\n\n\n “How can you say that, apprentice? The Spring Prayer is a sacred ritual,” Damuel remarked in disbelief\n\n\n I was well aware of its significance. But…\n\n\n Can’t he just let me off this time , I need to vent some of my frustrations.\n\n\n “I know it is important, Sir Damuel. I’m just not looking forward to me passing out because of the journey there.”\n\n\n “…Hm. Seeing how you can barely get by everyday, I sort of understand your feelings. But I doubt Ferdinand-sama will let you skip out.”\n\n\n I was fully aware that there was no escape for me. But, as a last ditch effort, I waited till the High Priest was back before presenting my thoughts to him.\n\n\n “High Priest, is it a must for me to go to the towns for the Spring Prayer? I am confident that travelling in the carriages will take a toll on me.”\n\n\n “You are right. I will prepare more potions for you,” the High Priest gave a nonchalant response\n\n\n I squirmed when I recalled the potion that was forced down me when I had a fainting spell because he still needed me around.\n\n\n “…You mean that effective but disgusting potion that makes you want to drop dead with its horrendous taste?”\n\n\n “Yes.”\n\n\n “Gah… I don’t want to go more now.”\n\n\n This was how everything would unfold: I will faint on the journey to the town, be forced to drink the High Priest’s horrible potions, dragged to complete the ritual while the potion still lasts, and then faint again before we move on to the next town. An endless loop of suffering would await me with every town we visited. I was getting sick thinking about it.\n\n\n “High Priest, please fix the potion’s taste. Or just make me take a sleeping drug so that I will be out for the entire journey, or let me on those magic statues the knights use. Can you please try something? I beg of you.”\n\n\n I was so desperate that I tried to give every solution I could think of and proposed it to the High Priest.\n\n\n The High Priest nodded, a little disturbed.\n\n\n “…Since you look that desperate, I will try my best.”\n\n\n “Thank you so much. Oh and, would it be ok for my attendant to bring a harspiel though I know that’s not possible.”\n\n\n I did not want to damage a valuable instrument so I had hoped he would say no, but the High Priest accepted it without hesitation.\n\n\n “Contrary to that, it would be better to bring it. Rosina’s playing throughout the trip will definitely be calming throughout the deep nights.”\n\n\n “Wait, you’re serious?” I was taken aback. “I heard we could be in danger because of bandits and monsters. Won’t this precious instrument be damaged if we get attacked?”\n\n\n The High Priest looked befuddled by what I said.\n\n\n “No bandits will be willing to target blue priests and nobles in charge of the Spring Prayer, unless they are foolish enough to do so.”\n\n\n “…Wait really? No danger at all?”\n\n\n I presumed that bandits will be happy to select wealthy nobles as their target, but apparently that was not so.\n\n\n “Myne, most bandits are just farmers.”\n\n\n “Huh? Aren’t bandits something like thieves that make a living from robbing others?”\n\n\n “Fool. If that was so, the merchants would stop travelling to these targeted areas. Even if they did take these paths, they would hire guards and this would make robbing them much more difficult. If they continued robbing people, the Knight’s Order would take action. It is simply impossible to live on robbing others.”\n\n\n I had the false idea that merchants travelled frequently. The High Priest got annoyed at how little I knew about this world.\n\n\n “It is not unusual to see some commoners turn to the thieving trade temporarily to exhort money and goods from merchants, but it would be foolish to attack nobles as that would mean that their land would no longer receive chalices. As such, no farmers will dare to target nobles or priests. And even if they did, winning is impossible.”\n\n\n So it turns out bandits did not dare attack nobles because of the consequences their actions would have on the farming towns, and also because the nobles could easily defeat them with their mana.\n\n\n “So the trip will be completely safe?”\n\n\n “…Yes, supposedly.”\n\n\n I wondered why there was some hesitance from the High Priest, nevertheless, I was relieved that our trip would be much safer than expected, but that was the only thing I could be glad of.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n I had a busy morning before our trip for the Spring Prayer. I took a bath and put on my ceremonial robes and hairstick. Since Fran said the farming towns would be muddy, I decided to wear my new pig leather boots, though I doubt the towns would be worse than the lower city, but I still gave it the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\n After prepping myself, the rest of the items were stored in boxes and tied up with ropes. And with that I was ready. Fran and Gil worked together to load the boxes into the carriage, and Rosina just clung onto the harspiel case, hugging it gleefully.\n\n\n Since I had nothing to do in my very bare room, I took the chance to say my goodbyes to the rest of my attendants.\n\n\n “Wilma, I entrust the orphanage to you.”\n\n\n “Yes, Sister Myne. I promise you that before your return, the children will be polite little angels. When the time comes, please praise them.”\n\n\n As I nodded to the request. Gil knelt down and looked at me as though he was saying “My turn now, praise me”.\n\n\n I stretched out and patted his head, “Please look after the workshop, Gil. I take it that you will do a good job?”\n\n\n “Yep, leave it up to me!”\n\n\n “Please look after my chambers while I’m away, Delia.”\n\n\n “Of course… Geez! Why are you so worried?! I’m more concerned that you won’t be able to carry out your duties properly, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n Delia scowled and her crimson hair seemed to be raised like a lion. It’s not that I was worried that she couldn’t handle looking after my chambers, but I dreaded the horrible carriage ride.\n\n\n “Ngh… I’m worried about the ride.”\n\n\n “Geeeez! You’re making me even more worried!”\n\n\n “Uh-uh, I’ll do my best,” I stammered.\n\n\n Delia was probably losing all hope on me, which she probably didn’t even know she had in me initially.\n\n\n Fran walked back to me once he noticed that I had finished my pleasantries. “It is time for us to depart, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n “Sure. Let’s go.”\n\n\n “Goodbye. We pray for your safe journey.”\n\n\n Some of my attendants said their goodbyes and I left the room after Fran, with Rosina and Damuel after me. We walked to the side of the temple where the nobles resided, the main entrance was close there, where the carriages were stationed.\n\n\n “Rosina and I will double check the belongings and then discuss our plans for the trip with Arno. Please rest in the resting room with Damuel. The High Priest will be there too.”\n\n\n I followed the instructions and left for the waiting room, with Damuel behind. On route, I ran into the High Priest who was with his attendants.\n\n\n “Good morning, High Priest.”\n\n\n “Good morning. Myne, please head to my chambers. There is something important I need to tell you. Wait there until I am done briefing my attendants. Damuel I take it that you understand what to do?”\n\n\n “Yes, sir!”\n\n\n We finished our talk and the High Priest took quick strides to the carriages. Though he was moving quickly, he was moving with so much grace. I exchanged looks with Damuel before we left for the High Priest’s chambers.\n\n\n We entered with ease as some of his attendants were there to welcome us. We took our seats, and the High Priest returned quickly.\n\n\n “Thank you for the wait.”\n\n\n “High Priest, what is the important thing you mentioned?” I asked in curiosity\n\n\n My head tilted to the side and watched the High Priest close and lock his cabinets filled with paperwork.\n\n\n “There has been a change in plans. We will be riding highbeasts. I have ordered the carriages to depart and wait at our next accommodation…”\n\n\n “…Is something going on?”\n\n\n “Hopefully, it’s nothing,” he said, he held into a bunch of keys as he walked into his hidden room, returning with a ring that had a yellow feystone in it and a bangle with embedded seven multicoloured stones\n\n\n “Myne, put them on.”\n\n\n “Lord Ferdinand, that’s—”\n\n\n “As a safety precaution, Damuel.”\n\n\n The High Priest was wearing a similar bracelet and a ring on his middle finger, the ring looked like the one he lent me for the Knight’s Order mission. It proved to be helpful then, so it would probably do the same again.\n\n\n I was glad to use them both, putting on the ring on my left ring finger like the High Priest’s.\n\n\n “Also, as much as I don’t want to say this…”\n\n\n “Yes?”\n\n\n “We will have… another blue priest with us,” the High Priest mumbled with a conflicted expression.\n\n\n I was surprised by the sudden announcement and the door opened at the same time. Karstedt came in with an unfamiliar blue priest.\n\n\n “That will be me, Sylvester. I see, you’re the apprentice shrine maiden that is a commoner?”\n\n\n He analysed me with his thick eyebrows and profound green eyes. He had bluish purple hair tied up with a silver rope. I kept looking at the rope he used to tie his hair. Though he was shorter than the High Priest, he was more well-built, he looked more knight-like than the High Priest who used to serve as one. He looked similar in age as Benno and the High Priest, but that did not help because the latter two were far apart in age despite their looks.\n\n\n “…You’re so small but you’ve been baptised? Have you been lying about your age?” Sylvester laughed and gave me a vulgar stare.\n\n\n I was so tempted to shout back, but I held myself back. No matter what, Sylvester was still a blue priest. I had no power to argue back.\n\n\n “Hey. Say ‘poowee.’”\n\n\n Sylvester poked out a finger after staring at me for so long. The finger poked my cheek and burrowed in deep.\n\n\n “Ow!” I gave a shout of pain, but he only shook his head.\n\n\n “Yes, but not quite there. Try again, say ‘poowee.”\n\n\n He did it again but with less strength. I looked at the High Priest out of desperation. But he just looked away and sighed to say he could do nothing.\n\n\n “Myne, though he might seem horrible, he has a good heart underneath that horrid rot. Your only choice is to give in to his requests. And Sylvester, Myne is actually extremely weak. If you keep pushing her she might die. Anyways, Karstedt, come over and look at this.”\n\n\n The High Priest took out and unrolled a map.\n\n\n “Yes, sire!”\n\n\n Karstedt walked to the High Priest, leaving me with Sylvester and Damuel who had gone pale. No one was going to save me now…\n\n\n “C’mon. Do it.” Sylvester stared at me deeper and still kept his finger on my cheek. There was no way I could say no to a noble.\n\n\n “P-Poowee.”\n\n\n I just hardened myself and gave a “poowee” like he wanted…\n\n\n Sylvester was satisfied with my response and nodded before poking me again.\n\n\n “Good. Continue again.”\n\n\n “Poowee~ Poowee~ Poowee…”\n\n\n I dreaded the trip even more now, knowing that I would be stuck with this blue priest for the entire Spring Prayer.\n\n\n 1. forme: (from wikipedia) in typesetting, a forme is imposed by a stoneman working on a flat imposition stone when he assembles the loose components of a page (or number of simultaneously printed pages) into a locked arrangement, inside a chase, ready for printing."

But I had hoped too soon, he didn’t get bored but turned his attention to something else.\n\n\n “What are you wearing?” he asked and proceeded to pull out my hair stick.\n\n\n Without being able to respond back, I felt my hair loosen and drop down. I looked up to see Sylvester examining the hair stick made by my family for me. He looked like he was in his late twenties, but he was acting crazy and immaturely like a kid.\n\n\n He’s going to break it!\n\n\n My face paled when that thought went across my head.\n\n\n “P-Please return it.” I stretched out my hand.\n\n\n But my desperation only made Sylvester turn into a mischievous cat. He stretched his hand above his head and dangled my hairstick, laughing at me to jump for it. I already knew that he wasn’t going to return it back.\n\n\n “Give it back!”\n\n\n Sylvester kept moving away from me as I ran and jumped about to snatch back my hairstick. I quickly started to feel breathless.\n\n\n “I’m… begging you… give it back… It belongs… to me… It’s…the hair stick my… family made… for me…”\n\n\n Urgh… I hate boys like this.\n\n\n My fists tightened and eyes narrowed with my gaze set on the hairstick above me. My body surged with mana as anger coursed through my veins.\n\n\n “Ahhhh! Apprentice, don’t!” Damuel started panicking, which caused Karstedt and the High Priest to turn back at us enraged.\n\n\n They each took out a wand that looked like a conductor’s conducting stick and waved them.\n\n\n “You fool! Didn’t I warn you to not tease her?!”\n\n\n “Don’t bully a kid!!”\n\n\n Their wands had changed into maces and they slammed it onto Sylvester’s hand with a satisfying thump. I froze and panicked about how much it would hurt, but Sylvester remained indifferent and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\n “Aren’t you all overreacting? What’s wrong with a little playtime.”\n\n\n Nothing went into Sylvester’s head at all, but my rage cooled down because I realised that the High Priest and Karstedt were around to reprimand him.\n\n\n My hair stick was snatched back from Sylvester by the High Priest who then returned it back to me.\n\n\n “I assume that you can put this back on youself?”\n\n\n “Yes. Thank you, High Priest.”\n\n\n I gripped the stick and pushed it back into my hair. Sylvester watched me bun my hair up and tried to grab it again, but Karstedt slapped his hand and pointed to the pale Damuel.\n\n\n “Play with Damuel and leave Myne alone. He can handle it better.”.\n\n\n The High Priest nodded back and chased Sylvester away.\n\n\n “Yes. Go somewhere else with Damuel. Myne, come over here.”\n\n\n With that, I was carried towards his work table, and the High Priest and Karstedt continued their discussion over the map, ignoring Damuel’s cries of plea in the background.\n\n\n Anyways, I was amazed by the map on the table. It had so many details, it was on a completely different level than the Merchant Guild’s. The latter only drew and labelled the city and roads, but this one detailed the entire duchy.\n\n\n The geography of the duchy was stretched out laterally from the north to the south, with areas labelled in either red or blue. The areas near the cities were red, but there were more blue ones as you moved further away from the cities.\n\n\n …What do the colours mean?\n\n\n I wanted to find out, but I didn’t want to interrupt their discussion that seemed very important, so I just continued examining the map.\n\n\n “…Ok, that is all.”\n\n\n “Then we should head off now.”\n\n\n After Karstedt and the High Priest had finished their discussion, we could now go to the Noble’s Gate.\n\n\n “Damual, please look after Myne. Sylvester, carry this. And Karstedt, take that.”\n\n\n I was carried by Damuel as we left the room while Karstedt and Sylvester transported bulky luggage.\n\n\n I whispered to Damuel, “Sir Damuel, I don’t want to be anywhere close to that blue priest if possible.”\n\n\n “I agree with you too”\n\n\n Me and Damuel agreed on this and he moved away from Sylvester and watched him cautiously. Though Sylvester was a blue priest, his family’s status seemed to be superior to Damuel’s\n\n\n I wanted to keep my distance from Sylvester as much as possible because I was worried that another Shikza would appear if I offended him. But despite my wishes, he stuck close to us.\n\n\n “Why does it seem like you two are distancing yourself from me?”\n\n\n “N-no, you must be seeing wrong,” I stammered and looked around for help. But Karstedt was too far away. I looked over Damuel’s shoulder and noticed that the High Priest was catching up us now that he had finished instructing his attendants.\n\n\n “High Priest,” I mumbled, giving Ferdinand a headache as he rubbed his head.\n\n\n “Sylvester, please stop bothering Myne. It will be troublesome for me if she collapses before the Spring Prayer.”\n\n\n “If she can actually collapse from this, that’s really pathetic.”\n\n\n I was now at his height because Damuel was carrying me, making it more convenient for Sylvester to poke my cheek. Thankfully, the High Priest slapped his hand down.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n The Noble’s Gate was open and Karstedt stood in the square, waiting for us. With the High Priest signal, the three of them (the High Priest, Damuel and Karstedt) transformed their feystones into their own highbeasts.\n\n\n “Karstedt will lead. The middle will be Myne and Damuel, and Sylvester and I will stay in the back.”\n\n\n “Are you good with that, apprentice?” asked Damuel.\n\n\n “…Sir Damuel, you did not even try to project me from Sir Sylvester.”\n\n\n Damuel had made zero efforts to protect me from Sylvester.\n\n\n Not a very reliable bodyguard\n\n\n To be frank, I felt like to was a safer option to ride with the High Priest.\n\n\n “B-but, it’s just because…” Damuel stammered and his words trailed off. He reconsidered if he should finish his sentence, but in the end he just ended off with a soft “Sorry”.\n\n\n We were riding on a winged horse. I was sitting on the front while Damuel sat behind me with the reins in hand. The wings sprung open and flew behind Karstedt’s griffon highbeast.\n\n\n We only went past the lower city and then the city’s wall before the griffon started to make its descent. The first stop was the winter manor of the closest town, south to the city. It was the same town my family went to butcher the pigs. The manor was tall and wide, making it look like an ancient school. Its front was a field that reminded me of a sports track. I saw many people gathering at the field far down below. There were roughly a thousand of them.\n\n\n We moved towards the square and the crowd parted to make way for us. Karstedt made a majestic landing on the open space and kept away his highbeast. Damuel’s highbeast landed next to him. Karstedt carried me off, Damuel got off before putting away his highbeast too.\n\n\n “Make way!” Sylvester called out on top of the High Priest’s lion.\n\n\n With me in his arms, Karstedt move to the side and watched the blue man jump down and yell. “What?!”\n\n\n “Bweh?!”\n\n\n The crowd was getting excited by what was unfolding. They watched on with excitement as the man in blue made a somersault, landing with a pose. He was infecting them with his energy as the crowd roared with a burst of energy like this was some sort of performance.\n\n\n “This fool is beyond hope.”\n\n\n I could feel that Karstedt’s annoyance. In the next second, the High Priest’s lion made a violent landing towards Sylvester to crush him. But it failed as he tumbled away like a gymnast and posed again.\n\n\n “WOOOAAHHHH!” The crowed was getting even more hyped.\n\n\n Sylvester had on a haughty smile, like a was a kid who had just done something outstanding.\n\n\n “… Do priests usually perform tricks to entertain people during the Spring Prayer?” I asked half-seriously, half surprised that Sylvester was unlike any of the other blue priests I knew.\n\n\n Karstedt frowned and shook his head. “Myne. Just ignore him. That man is just a bad influence. Take note that that man is someone you must never become.”\n\n\n “I assume that Sylvester must be from the upper echelons since he behaves so casually with you, Lord Karstedt. Is there a possibility that he might treat me like Shikza did in the past?”\n\n\n I sincerely asked Karstedt what I should do around someone who acted inconsiderate and without care for those of less importance. My question troubled Karstedt.\n\n\n “He is not one to harm others, so you will be fine. He can just be a bit difficult… and a wreck.”\n\n\n “If by any chance Sylvester does anything to me, may I request for your protection, my future father?” I asked with my head tilted sideways.\n\n\n Karstedt got a surprise and smiled after that.\n\n\n “Please do. You can always come running to me. I’ll defeat any bad guys who bully my adoptive daughter.”\n\n\n …What a reliable father, I must say.\n\n\n I had successfully won over Karstedt and his protection. The High Priest kept away his highbeast and walked towards the small stage on the other side of the square. The crowd split to make way for him. On the other hand, Sylvester dug through his bag and fish out a huge chalice that was roughly eighty centimeters tall. He held it carefully and with reverence as he walked behind the High Priest.\n\n\n Karstedt knelt down so that I could get off his arms and signalled me to walk with them. But with the speed I was walking at, I was soon carried back into his arms. He walked quickly to the stage. It appeared that my walking speed was outrageously slow.\n\n\n I’m not slow, it’s because adults have longer legs than me. I’m not to blame.\n\n\n I was carried to the stage and placed down. After which, Karstedt and Damuel walked to the front of the stage and gave a stern look towards the crowd that this was an important event. The High Priest received the chalice, that was a divine instrument, from Sylvester, he walked to the centre of the stage and placed it onto a stand.\n\n\n “We will now commence the Spring Prayer. May I invite the head of this town and those from the neighbouring ones.”\n\n\n With the High Priest’s announcement, five men walked up onto the stage, each of them was carrying a large bucket with lids, they looked like they had a capacity of ten litres.\n\n\n “Myne, we will begin.”\n\n\n The High Priest carried me to the stand because I was not tall enough. I knelt down onto the red cloth that went up and over the stand.\n\n\n The chalice resembled a huge wine glass. It had large feystones embellished the outside of its body, and smaller ones going down its body, stem and to the base.\n\n\n I moved closer to the chalice and put my hands onto the feystones embedded on its bottom.\n\n\n “O Goddess of Water, Flutrane who bestows healing and change. O twelve goddesses, guardians of Goddess Flutrane. The Goddess of Earth Guduldh has been freed from the God of Life Ewigeliebe. Please bestow your younger sister the power to bring forth new life.\n\n\n The crowd gasped in amazement as they witnessed my mana flowing to the chalice, making it beam with a golden light.\n\n\n “I bring you gifts, of our happiness and shouts of joy. We present to you our prayers and words of thanks, in exchange for the blessings of your divine protection. I humbly request that you bless the thousands of mortals with your diving color.”\n\n\n After I finished saying my prayers, Sylvester and the High Priest worked together to pour the green liquid in the chalice into the buckets brought forth by the chiefs.\n\n\n “Praise thee Goddess of Earth and the Goddess of Water!”\n\n\n After the first bucket was full and the lid was on, some people started shouting prayers and thanking the gods. I guessed that they were all from the same town the just filled bucket was for, and the same praises rang out too with every bucket that was filled.\n\n\n I did my best to keep my hands stuck on the chalice and maintained my flow of mana into it until all the buckets were filled,\n\n\n “That is all, Myne.” The High Priest said.\n\n\n My hands retreated off the chalice and it was put back up again, after that the High Priest carried me back to the floor of the stage. I was in the centre because I was the one who offered my mana, while Sylvester and the High Priest stood diagonally behind me on my left and right respectively.\n\n\n “Praise thee gods!” the High Priest yelled out.\n\n\n I made a praying pose and everyone else followed along too. The townsfolk made the pose with ease and seamlessly, compared to the folks in the lower city. That was probably because they had to do the pose at this time every year.\n\n\n “The Spring Prayer has ended. Work and live diligently with the new life the gods have bestowed upon you all!” The High Priest announced which received lots of cheers from the crowd. On the other side, Sylvester kept the chalice in a large cloth and placed it carefully back into his bag.\n\n\n And with that, the ceremony was over. The High Priest proceeded to call out his highbeast, he and Sylvester got on its back\n\n\n “Please pardon us as we will be making our leave, we have a busy schedule ahead of usthis year. May the gods bless you all.”\n\n\n The High Priest’s lion flew around the crowd and scattered gold dust onto them. Karstedt and Damuel moved to call out their highbeasts too. Damuel carried me onto his horse before himself, the highbeast spread its wings and made its ascent, I watched as the town grew smaller.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n Throughout the day, we made our way throughout the winter manors from four towns and did the Spring Prayer ceremony at each one. The sun was setting when we finished our work and I felt drained.\n\n\n “We will now be heading to our accommodation for the night. Apprentice, please wake up. You are going to fall off,” Damuel nagged at me and I nodded my heavy head, trying my best to hold the reins.\n\n\n “Myne, wake up.”\n\n\n Bweh?!”\n\n\n I got shocked awake by the High Priest’s command. I examined my surroundings and noticed that we were in front of a large building.\n\n\n “Where is this place?”\n\n\n “Where are we?”\n\n\n “Baron Blon’s summer manor.”\n\n\n The High Priest explained that nobles who owned land bestowed by the archduke would live in their manors in the towns they were in charge of from the Spring Prayer to the Harvest Festival. Only during the winter would they return to the Noble’s District to pay their taxes and present their yearly report. Nobles that stayed in the city would collate all this information for the year.\n\n\n “That section is the residence for the nobles, the guest priests will stay here instead.”\n\n\n The nobles with the land would prepare a residence for the visiting priests because they visited every Spring Prayer and Harvest Festival. But upon closer examination, the reason they built a separate residence was to keep the priests away from them. Though the priests came from noble families, they were not viewed as one. This sentiment was evident because the priests were only welcomed by a representative, the nobles did not care to greet them.\n\n\n “Arno should have greeted them and requested for the residence to be opened for us.”\n\n\n The place where we would be staying had a few carriages parked outside. They were empty as all our luggage had been moved in.\n\n\n “Welcome.”\n\n\n We were greeted by our attendants when we entered the residence. There were a few unfamiliar faces so I guessed that they were Sylvester’s attendants.\n\n\n Arno stepped forward and spoke softly to the High Priest.\n\n\n “We are ready to serve the food, but there are only two dining rooms. What do we do?”\n\n\n “Prepare it in the larger hall. Everyone will dine together. Make sure that Sylvester is seated the furthest from Myne.”\n\n\n “Yes sir.”\n\n\n Winter had just ended, so the farming town would not have sufficient food supply for a large group of priests and attendants. Though they did sell us simple vegetables, eggs and milk, we still had to bring some of our own food like grains and oil. This troublesome procedure was why many of the priests disliked conducting the Spring Prayer and preferred to stay behind.\n\n\n “Well then everyone. Please wash up and we will meet at the dining room.”\n\n\n With the High Priest’s instructions, the group of attendants split to attend to their own masters. I saw Rosina and Fran rushing towards me. A wave of relief and comfort spread over me at the sight of them.\n\n\n “Welcome, Sister Myne. We will need to get you changed.”\n\n\n I followed them to the room where I will be resting. Priests conducted ceremonies, and the Spring Prayer in this case, in pairs. Some residences would have a third room prepared in case a third priest accompanied them. Karstedt, Sylvester and the High Priest were staying the rooms meant for the priests. Since Damuel and I were lower in standing we had to stay in the rooms for attendants.\n\n\n “You might be uncomfortable about this, Sir Damuel. I’m quite used to this because my house is actually much smaller.”\n\n\n Some nobles might be unsatisfied by this room that was much more downscaled compared to the ones for priests, but it was much bigger than the average home in the lower city. I did not feel uncomfortable at all. The carpet and blanket from my chambers in the temple made me plenty satisfied.\n\n\n Fran filled a tub full of warm water, and Rosina helped to wipe me down. Having a bath was the best feeling now after spending so much time outside.\n\n\n After my bath, Rosina picked out a set of clothes dyed in the colour of green grass, accompanied by a pair of delicate cloth shoes. I had prepared many hair sticks for the Spring Prayer, this time Rosina picked the one from Tuuli, she had spent the winter making it. It used yellow, orange, and yellow-green thread to make flowers as these were the colours that symbolised sprint… The flowers were sewn together to form a beautiful bouquet of flowers.\n\n\n “Hugo and Ella gave their best to cook this meal. They did not want to lose to the other chefs.”\n\n\n “Then it looks like I will need to give this meal my best too.”\n\n\n I was not looking forward to eating with nobles. Though Rosina and Fran had done their best to make sure noble manners were ingrained into my head, I was still nervous at how Karstedt, my soon to be adoptive father, would be inspecting my every move to see how well a commoner would fare. And there was Sylvester too. What on earth would he say?\n\n\n If only he was a kid, I could ignore him. But he was a high-ranking noble so that was not possible.\n\n\n “Can I come back to my room after my meal?”\n\n\n “You cannot refuse if you are invited to a meeting after the meal because of your status.”\n\n\n Uhhhh, that doesn’t sound good…\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n The meal was ready and was held in the dining hall. Everyone was donned in their own clothes. The High Priest was dressed casually, this was quite the sight because I have only seen him in his priest robes, or that one time he wore his armour. The clothes had a baggy style and long sleeves, which were very noble-like styled. I have only seen Sylvester in his priest robes too, but it wasn’t as impactful seeing him in his casual clothes because I just met him today.\n\n\n “You look just like a noble when you are wearing these clothes,” Karstedt commented.\n\n\n I hope that that was a compliment. Glad that he was not angry or disappointed with me.\n\n\n “Thank you for the praise, Lord Karstedt.”\n\n\n “Looks like the lessons she went through the winter was successful,” the High Priest added on. “Her behaviour and way of speaking is much better now. But she still needs to work on hiding her emotions.”\n\n\n All his compliments would be paired with criticisms, it never felt like his compliments were truly sincere.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, please take your seat.”\n\n\n Fran brought me to my seat and brought out my food.\n\n\n “Why are you eating different food from the rest of us?” Sylvester asked when he saw what I had.\n\n\n “That might be because our meals were prepared by different chefs,” I continued, “Fran, would you care to explain?”\n\n\n There were two kitchens here, Hugo and Ella were assigned to the smaller one, the larger one was for the other chefs to make noble food.\n\n\n “It turns out that it was because my food came from another kitchen. Since I have the least attendants, my chefs were assigned to the smaller one.”\n\n\n I got the chance to eat the food I liked because of that. Sylvester (who was seated the furthest away from me) was examining my food with curiosity.\n\n\n “Smells good.”\n\n\n “Yes it is, my chefs are quite special.”\n\n\n Now that everyone had all their food on the table, we crossed our arms and said our prayers.\n\n\n “I offer thanks and prayers to thee, O mighty King and Queen of the eternal sky who have graced us with thousands and thousands of lives for sustenance, thee O mighty Immortal Five who look over the mortal realm, I shall be grateful to partake in this blessed meal”\n\n\n Just as I took my first bite, Sylvester yelled out, “Hey! Why are you eating it?!”\n\n\n I was confused by what he said, I tiled my head and asked.\n\n\n “…Am I not allowed to?”\n\n\n The High Priest sighed, “Sylvester is interested in your food, Myne.”\n\n\n “But he only said it smelt good?””\n\n\n So it turns out that Sylvester had been using the confusing noble’s way of speaking to demand that I hand over my food. I completely missed that.\n\n\n “I will not give you everything. Half of it will be fine.”\n\n\n “H-half?” Sylvester looked shocked by what I said, but honestly I was the one who was shaken.\n\n\n “This is my food. Surely a humble blue priest of your status would not take away a pitiful common girl’s food, right?”\n\n\n “Y-yes, of course not.”\n\n\n Sylvester was so desperate to try my food that he eventually settled for half of it. Although it was common for attendants to receive dishes that were half-filled, it appeared that no one would give away their half-eaten food to someone else.\n\n\n Karstedt and the High Priest looked like they gave up on everything and just rubbed their own heads, Damuel looked like a deer in the headlights.\n\n\n The High Priest told me on a later occasion that when someone was interested in trying your food, you were supposed to offer them your whole plate first. After they took their share they would pass the plate back to you. So apparently I was supposed to pass him my food first.\n\n\n So it was wrong for me to give him the later half… Argh.\n\n\n Sylvester drank all the soup I offered to him, his whole face brightened and demanded that I transfer my chefs to his side too. Fortunately, Karstedt and the High Priest were there to protect me and I finished my food without any more trouble.\n\n\n Deep in my heart, I was so thankful that we were sitting the furthest apart.\n\n\n I stood up and declared.\n\n\n “I will take my leave now. Please enjoy your discussion.”\n\n\n I bid my goodbyes to the others seeing that they were preparing for the next gathering, I wanted to retreat back into the safety of my room. But I was not so lucky this time as Sylvester locked onto me with his deep green eyes like a hungry predator.\n\n\n He stopped me in my tracks. “Stop there, Myne. You’re coming along. We negotiate on trading chefs.:\n\n\n …Argh. So he hasn’t forgotten about it."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “H-High Priest…”\n\n\n “Do note that you cannot decline it with your status.”\n\n\n I looked towards the High Priest to save me since I was not feeling good about the invitation, but my plea for help ended with his cutt-throat rejection.\n\n\n They are all nobles, so I know a commoner like me has no place to turn down the invitation. But at least I tried.\n\n\n “Come here, Myne.”\n\n\n The High Priest had made the effort to split us apart, but now Sylvester tapped the table between him and Karstedt beckoning me to sit beside him. I stayed still because there was no space for me to take a seat. In the next second, Karstedt and Damuel stood up and swapped their seats, they basically said there was no escaping this.\n\n\n “Myne, just do what Damuel did, walk around the table and sit next to Sylvester.”\n\n\n The High Priest nudged me towards Sylvester with a conflicted look because he knew that Sylvester’s order was absolute.\n\n\n “E-Excuse me then.”\n\n\n I stood up and made my way to the other side of the large table and sat next to Sylvester. Next to me was Karstedt, I tried sitting closer to him, trying to make it as subtle as possible. Damuel sat across me and High Priest was across Sylvester.\n\n\n “Hear me, Myne,” Sylvester said, “What do you say with trading chefs? You’re good with that, right? Hear me, I’m not stealing, we’re just making a trade.”\n\n\n But Ella and Hugo technically worked under Benno. He would be furious if I traded them away without telling him first, and it would be a huge disaster if we had our recipes leaked.\n\n\n “The chefs are working for me but are legally employed by someone else. I am not in the position to trade them away.”\n\n\n “Then I’ll talk to that person. Who is it?”\n\n\n Not only was Benno powerless to turn down an offer from a noble, he would be upset that the Italian restaurant he had worked so hard on would be over because he did not have the necessary staff. I was already seeing Benno and Mark suffering as all their hardwork vanished into nothing.\n\n\n “Brother Sylvester, a merchant will be unable to turn down an offer from someone as noble as you. You will not present him with an offer, but a demand that he cannot object to.”\n\n\n “Yes, that might happen with a merchant,” Sylvester muttered to himself with an interested look.\n\n\n So what the High Priest was true, Sylvester was good deep inside, but it was buried way too deep inside. He was not angered by what I said, he just nudged his head forward, telling me to continue.\n\n\n I turned to sneak a peek at the High Priest and he gave a small nod. Damuel was all pale and trembling like a terrified mouse. There was no way I was going to give up on my chefs.\n\n\n “My chefs will soon work in an upcoming restaurant. They have undergone some intense training for that job, which took up quite a sum of money, along with building the restaurant. The amount of money spent on it might seem small to a noble, but the money can decide the life or death of a commoner. Brother Sylvester, are you still going to take the chefs even after knowing that it will cause a restaurant’s business to fail? I would like to offer an alternative instead, if you enjoyed their food and would like more, you can come in as a customer when the restaurant opens.\n\n\n “Oh, a restaurant? So the commoners will get to eat that food?”\n\n\n Sylvester looked dumbfounded by what I said. I tried my best to put on the smile that Benno would have when he talked to customers, seizing this chance to promote the restaurant.\n\n\n “The food will be quite expensive, so only the wealthy in the lower city can afford it , furthermore the restaurant will only serve those who have been introduced by existing customers. The interior has been designed to look like that you see in a noble’s mansion, and the food served are suited to the noble’s taste, in fact, the food served will be that not even nobles have come across.”\n\n\n “Is that so, then who will introduce me?”\n\n\n “Uhm… since you have expressed interest, I will be pleased to introduce you myself.”\n\n\n To be frank, I did not want to shoulder the sure-to-come heavy responsibility of introducing a troublesome noble like Sylvester (childish as he is) to the restaurant. But I would have to settle for that than to give up my chefs and destroy the restaurant.\n\n\n “That’s fine. Introduce me. I want to have a look around the place.”\n\n\n “I am evermore grateful. Lord Karstedt, High Priest, are you interested to visit too?”\n\n\n I begged with all my might using just my eyes. I really wanted someone to control Sylvester, with great reluctance, the two of them nodded back.\n\n\n …I guess since Brother Sylvester is sort of a noble, Benno might be happy about this? Or maybe he’ll get angry at me. Whatever his reaction will be, I just want him to be thankful that I was the one who prevented him from losing his chefs.\n\n\n I gave myself a pat on the back in my head for my great feats.\n\n\n The High Priest who had been enjoying his wine and snacks such as cheese and ham, shot up his arm at the sudden realisation of something.\n\n\n “Myne, will you get Rosina to play the harspiel?” he asked. I then recalled that he had gave her the permission to take the harspiel so that she could make the long nights more comfortable.\n\n\n I looked over to Fran, instructing him to pass the message to Rosina that her presence had been requested. Karstedt looked surprised by what was going on.\n\n\n “A commoner has a harspiel?”\n\n\n “I learnt how to with the High Priest’s orders.”\n\n\n I revealed everything about my education and how the High Priest was the one in charge of it.\n\n\n “So he was thinking this far ahead, this was expected given that we are talking about Lord Ferdinand.”\n\n\n Thinking back, the High Priest did not say anything about me getting adopted then, it was amazing that he could predict the future so well.\n\n\n “Myne is talented at music. Your practices have been going smoothly, no?”\n\n\n “It’s nothing much, Rosina is just that gifted at teaching.”\n\n\n I had been praised by the High Priest, but truthfully, Rosina was the one teaching me sternly. Under her guidance, I was not allowed to skip any lessons no matter what. If one practiced diligently everyday their playing would improve by leaps and bounds. Urano’s piano skills has stagnated because I didn’t commit to practicing daily.\n\n\n “I have arrived as you wished, master.”\n\n\n Rosina came into the hall carrying a harspiel. One of the attendants pulled out a chair from the table and Rosina took a seat while smiling. She played the songs Sylvester asked for.\n\n\n “Amazing. Where did a gray shrine maiden like you get to learn how to play the harspiel this well?”\n\n\n “Someone like myself only received the chance to learn the arts when serving my previous master, Sister Christine.”\n\n\n “I see… Ok then, Myne, it’s your turn.”\n\n\n Really? I have to say it was pretty cruel of him to make me play right after Rosina. She was from a different cut of cloth. My mind was running through all the possible excuses I could use to run away from his demands.\n\n\n “Uhm… I-I unfortunately will have to turn you down as I cannot play such a large harspiel with my tiny stature.”\n\n\n “Oh? Do not worry, Sister Myne. I packed your harspiel, too, in preparation for events like this. Pardon me while I head back to your room to retrieve it.”\n\n\n …NOOOoooo- why, Rosina, why—\n\n\n My upper body drooped over in despair. Kartedt gave me a gentle pat on the back to cheer me up while stifling his laughter. Sylvester had a large grin and turned to the High Priest.\n\n\n “Ok, Ferdinand, you’ll play first in the meantime.”\n\n\n I was so adamant that the High Priest would say no, contrary to what I expected, he stood up and picked up the harspiel, playing a tune after giving an annoyed sigh. It was a spectacular sight to see how he could play along with Rosina, but why did he have to choose the anime song I gave him?\n\n\n Though the composition was slightly different and the lyrics had been altered to a religious one, he was still playing an anime song!\n\n\n I did my best to hold back my laughter, so much so that my sides started to hurt. I never would have imagined that small prank I did would come back to me as bad karma.\n\n\n “I’ve never heard of that song,” Sylvester remarked.\n\n\n “Not surprised you haven’t,” the High Priest replied with indifference, and that made Sylvester frown.\n\n\n “What’s with that song? Who made it?”\n\n\n “…It’s a secret.”\n\n\n The High Priest looked at me and had a haughty smile. I gulped in shock. These all made Sylvester, who was next to me, raise an eyebrow and his eyes gleam.\n\n\n Ahhhh! Don’t announce it to the world and stop teasing him too! He’s getting interested in this now!\n\n\n I was panicking so much on the inside when Rosina returned with my harspiel.\n\n\n “Please go ahead, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n “Thank you, Rosina.”\n\n\n I began strumming the harspiel to a novice song I recently learnt. I was not going to play a song from my time as Urano as I didn’t want to attract more attention from Sylvester.\n\n\n Gotta say, I’m much better now.\n\n\n “…That’s ok, nothing great.”\n\n\n “It’s your turn now, Brother Sylvester. I would like to hear you play.”\n\n\n I knew so many people gifted in the arts, like Rosina, Wilma and the HIgh Priest, so I had a hard time imagining how a normal noble would fare. Letting Sylvester play might prove helpful in understanding the average noble.\n\n\n “I see. You want to hear my music? Hmph, fine, I’ll do it. Consider yourself lucky.”\n\n\n Sylvester took the harspiel with an arrogant expression, which made me doubt he could play music well. But it seems that I was wrong. He was way more talented than I expected. His playing sounded pleasant and he was singing with the perfect pitch.\n\n\n …Hnnnh. All these nobles have cheat stats…\n\n\n I always believed that the High Priest was setting the bar too high for me, but it looks like it was just because the nobles were all talented.\n\n\n “Would you like to try playing too, Lord Karstedt?”\n\n\n “I’m not a fan of the harspiel. I would prefer to play my flute, but I do not have it on hand right now.”\n\n\n Another shocking discovery - so a buff knight like Karstedt knows how to play music too. It seems like he liked a wind-instrument because he had the lung capacity (which he built up from training) for it. Whereas the harspiel only needed him to strum strings.\n\n\n Wow. That’s so cool.\n\n\n “But it wouldn’t be polite for me to do nothing. Let me think… I can perform a sword dance instead.”\n\n\n “A sword dance?! I’ve never seen it before. May I please watch yours, if possible?”\n\n\n I had never seen a sword dance before, not even when I was Urano. I looked at Karstedt with sparkling eyes full of anticipation. He signaled to Damuel with a nod. They took out their wand and chanted “schwert”. The wands instantly transformed into a sword. They both stood opposite each other and tapped their blades before pointing them upwards, signaling the start of the dance. They cut through the air swiftly in sync and did not make any wasteful movements, their swords reflected the light with every movement.\n\n\n The sword dance consisted of several simple moves, so everyone in the Knight’s Order could do it. But when two or more people performed it together without rehearsing, they had to carefully watch each other’s movements and where they were looking to move in sync. If any of them missed a beat or went out of sync, both parties could get fatally injured.\n\n\n Damuel was starting to sweat and pant. Having noticed this, Karstedt withdrew his sword and calmly announced.”\n\n\n “That will be all.”\n\n\n “Wow! Lord Karstedt, Sir Damuel, that was amazing! I was worried that you both might get injured, but it went perfectly!”\n\n\n I bomboarded them with a flurry of praises. But Sylvester started whining about how he could do better and then dragged Karstedt to do a sword dance with him.\n\n\n Uhh… Can I leave now?\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n I admit Sylvester did look kind of cool when he was so focused on something. He was dancing a more advanced routine than the previous, but it just made me more annoyed.\n\n\n “Heh. Cool, right? Feel free to shower me with praise,” Sylvester boasted, puffing his chest like a proud peacock.\n\n\n Now that the sword dance had ended, I could sincerely say this again, that he was super annoying. Like extremely.\n\n\n His childish personality was shining through again, all his coolness and my feelings of amazement for him disappeared.\n\n\n “…You were amazing, Brother Sylvester.”\n\n\n “Hey, that was so unfeeling. Do it again.”\n\n\n I was made to sing praises for him thrice. I was so done with him that I just pretended to be unwell as an excuse to quickly retreat back to my room."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Next morning, the High Priest met Baron Bron to give him one of the small chalices. We only needed to do that for the towns the nobles were in charge of. Things were different in the past when there were more priests and shrine maidens in the temple. The excess people would head down to these towns. But that was no longer possible with the shortage of mana Ehrenfest was facing and that we had to lend our mana to the other duchies,\n\n\n The Central District was the land that the archduke ruled directly without the need of another noble as a proxy leader. The chief of the towns in these areas would gather at the Central winter mansions, where they would directly receive the large chalices from the temple. For the other areas ruled by nobles, they could handle the distribution of mana stored in the smaller chalices by themselves.\n\n\n …If all the nobles had the mana to fill up the smaller chalices, why did the temple need to go out of the way to hold a Prayer Ceremony just to hand them the filled chalices? Even if there were some circumstances that prevented the nobles from filling it up themselves, why couldn’t we just pass the chalices to the nobles before they left the city, that would save so much time and energy? This all made no sense.\n\n\n I pretended that I understood all these, but in actuality I did not. In the end I just chose to keep these thoughts to myself, they probably had their own reasons why they had planned all these troublesome things.\n\n\n The High Priest returned from his meeting with the Baron, and we just spent the rest of the day visiting the large farming towns in the Central District, where the duchy primarily produced its grains. We performed the Spring Prayer at the five winter manors under the duke and another one ruled by a noble and we also stayed there.\n\n\n We repeated this for 2 more days and we had finished the Spring Prayers for the Central District.\n\n\n “As of tomorrow, we will only be visiting the lands ruled by nobles,” the High Priest declared with a serious expression.\n\n\n Throughout the trip, our main mode of transport were the highbeasts, that was beyond my expectations, and we would rarely ride the carriages. Before we reached the noble mansions, we would board the carriages at a short distance from it to pretend that we had been riding them the entire time.\n\n\n Everytime we visited the mansions, the High Priest would tell me to remain hidden under a veil made for noble girls. When the bumpy carriage stopped at the mansion, only the High Priest, Fran and me went in, while Sylvester and the knights would wait outside in the carriages. I thought that Sylvester would kick up a storm since he always wanted to be the centre of attention, but this time he would wait quietly in the carriage.\n\n\n “We will be heading to Viscount Gellach’s mansion next, we will board the carriage later. Let’s move,” said the High Priest as we boarded the highbeasts.\n\n\n It was still early in the morning, we had just passed the chalice to a noble and were off to catch up with the carriage that left first. The High Priest said that the carriages had a magical tool that acted as a tracking device, allowing him to track their location wherever they went.\n\n\n We caught up with the carriages without any problems. We split up such that Karstedt and Sylvester sat together, while I sat with Damuel and the High Priest. This was the best seating arrangement to maximise our defense and offense power. There was no way I had experience in combat so I just followed their instructions\n\n\n “Viscount Gellach might approach you with intentions, Myne. He personally requested you to carry out the Spring Prayer in his land. He has some connections with the High Bishop, so you best be careful around him.”\n\n\n The High Priest seemed very worried and agitated about this, he even told me to pull the veil lower to cover more of my face.\n\n\n As soon as we arrived, we were told to meet Viscount Gellach inside. The High Priest, Arno, Fran and I descended the carriage and made our way inside.\n\n\n “Ah, my Brother Ferdinand! Thank you for travelling this far to visit my mansion. Is the rumoured apprentice shrine maiden I’ve heard so much about?”\n\n\n He was probably trying to suck up to me, so his voice sounded super sticky and disgusting. His face was not in view because I was kneeling down and my vision was limited by the veil. I could only see his shin from my peripheral, that was enough to tell me that he was on the bigger side in terms of size.\n\n\n “I take it that you will be spending the night here? I am glad to have you!”\n\n\n “Unfortunately, we have a very tight schedule today and will have to take our leave now. Our accommodation for the night will be at Count Lesiegang’s estate.”\n\n\n After presenting the chalice, the High Priest gave a curt reply and left the room. He finished the entire meeting without me even needing to see Count Gellach’s face.\n\n\n We made a prompt leave from the mansion before noon, and we only arrived at Count Liesegang’s mansion late in the evening, which was in the next province.\n\n\n Because I was so used to riding the highbeast, it was only now did I realise how slow the carriages were. The High Priests said that we had swapped to the carriages so that our attendants would have ample time to make sure our rooms are ready. But seeing how he kept looking behind the carriage, there was probably another reason.\n\n\n The land Count Leisegang ruled over was the largest amongst the rest of the nobles in the duchy, but the room for priests that visited biannually was just as small, and my room was the one for the servants.\n\n\n I was forced to drink of the High Priest’s hand-made potions to make sure that my exhaustion would not take a toll on my health. With the potion I fell into a deep sleep until the morning and felt much more refreshed.\n\n\n That joyful morning, the High Priest had me summoned to his room and pushed over the magic tool that blocked out sound.\n\n\n “Intruders were in Karstedt’s room last night,” he said, but it appeared I was the only one who was confused by this. Everyone else frowned and had a serious expression, so they probably knew what was going on.\n\n\n “Intruders? Like thieves?”\n\n\n “No, they were kidnappers with you as their objective,” Karstedt explained.\n\n\n “There were two of them and they tried to leave when they noticed that the person sleeping was too big to be you. I got out of bed immediately and tried to subdue them, but…”\n\n\n Karstedt didn’t finish his lesson and turned to look at me, as though he was hesitant to tell me the full story.\n\n\n “Did they escape?”\n\n\n “No. I managed to get one of them and handed him over to Lord Ferdinand before moving off to track the other, trying to gather all the information I could from his whereabouts. He rode away on one of the two horses in the forest to the east of the mansion, but when I took out my highbeast to give chase, there was an explosion and he died.\n\n\n “Bweh?”\n\n\n I was having a hard time processing what he just said. He exploded and died? What on earth is he talking about?\n\n\n Sylvester noticed my shocked expression and continued, “Ferdinand was disarming the other man when he killed himself, and the other died from an explosion, that was everything that happened.”\n\n\n “I was hesitant to tell you this, but since you are their target, you have the right to know about this,” the High Priest continued. “Only a few are aware of your whereabouts, so Viscount Gellach must be the mastermind behind this. Myne, be careful.”\n\n\n He had pointed out the culprit in such a curt manner. I took a look at everyone else, clutching a hand close to my chest, feeling fearful and anxious.\n\n\n “…So there is no way that Count Leisegang is the culprit?” I asked, but Karstedt shook his head.\n\n\n “That is impossible. He and his family are relatives from my mother’s side, they would never endanger those around me.”\n\n\n We all forced ourselves to swallow down breakfasts despite our poor appetites before leaving Leisegang’s mansion. We would spend the night in the residence at the province to the south of the duchy. Our carriages took its leave to the residence while we spent the rest of the morning and afternoon visiting the other noble mansions.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n “We’ll catch up with the carriages now.”\n\n\n We finished our work for the day without any issue. The High Priest rode his highbeast to follow the road that our carriages were travelling on towards the southern end of the duchy.\n\n\n A minute later, a red light pierced straight through the sky. Everyone’s face turned grimmed because that was the signal for help from the Knight’s Order.\n\n\n “Ambush!” Karstedt yelled with urgency. His highbeast sped up towards the source of the red light.\n\n\n “Keep following!” the High Priest ordered as he raced past us.\n\n\n Worried that we would lose track of them, I gripped onto the reins and looked towards Damuel.\n\n\n “Sir Damuel, let’s hurry!”\n\n\n “…My mana is too little to go that fast.”\n\n\n “Then I’ll give you mine.”\n\n\n I was desperate to catch up and gripped on tighter to the reins, sending my mana into the highbeast and it sped up instantly,\n\n\n “Thanks!”\n\n\n We dashed through the forest and a wide open field, and we soon saw a group of carriages far in the distance. Fran, Rosina, Hugo and Ella were sitting inside… but there was a weird black mist surrounding them.\n\n\n “What’s that black stuff?!” I asked Damuel.\n\n\n We had rejoined the others but it would be hard for them to hear me at this speed.\n\n\n “That is the God of Darkness’s barrier. The barrier nullifies magic, so magic attacks are useless. Those that ambushed the carriages must have a noble behind them to carry out such an attack. It will be hard for us to enter the battle until we know what mana we’re up against,” Damuel explained in a tense tone.\n\n\n Suddenly, a group of roughly a hundred people (who were probably farmers) carrying weapons came charging towards the carriages from the forest. My mind throbbed seeing Fran and the others in danger. I made Damuel ride his highbeast next to the High Priest.\n\n\n “High Priest! Your magic doesn’t work on the barrier so please use it to subdue those men!”\n\n\n “Hold up! Do you not realise they could be people from this duchy?!” Sylvester objected to my suggestion looking shocked, but I just glared back at him as harshly as possible.\n\n\n These criminals were going to hurt those I cared about. Who on earth cared about who they were?!\n\n\n “Fran and Rosina’s safety are my top priority! I need to chant my prayers to release magic, right?!”\n\n\n I was deciding on which god I should dedicate my prayers to while releasing the mana I had built up. The mana started coursing through my body, and to the ring and bracelet I was wearing, making them glow.\n\n\n “Ferdinand! Stop her from releasing her mana” Sylvester yelled urgently.\n\n\n “She’s unstoppable now!” the High Priest shouted back in response.\n\n\n “Is there nothing we can do?! Who knows how many fatalities there will be if she releases such a powerful attack! There might be a war if the attack hits the neighbouring duchy! For the bare minimum, just buy me time to strengthen the border’s barrier!”\n\n\n “We can’t do anything about her, but we can redirect her target,” the High Priest muttered.\n\n\n He flew his lion closer to the highbeast me and Damuel were on, turning towards me.\n\n\n “Myne! If you want to protect those you care for, make a prayer to the wind!”\n\n\n I easily pictured the Goddess of Wind who I imagined as Wilma because I had yet to decide on a god to pray to, and it was also because I had done my own research on the gods.\n\n\n Schutzaria, the Goddess of Wind, was once the Goddess of Autumn. After the passing of the Goddess of Spring, the Wind shielded her sister, the Goddess of Earth from the revived God of Life. She summoned her shield of winter to block the God of Life’s ice and snow, holding him back until the end of the Autumn Harvest. She boasted the strength of her divine and impenetrable defence. Her defence protected the Goddess of Earth, unlike the Goddess of Water whose powers of melting the snow and ice only served to weaken the Goddess of Earth.\n\n\n Praying to the Goddess of Wind was the best option for me. I turned my raging line of sight back to the black mist and took a deep breath.\n\n\n …I will be the one to protect Fran and everyone else!\n\n\n “O Goddess of Wind, Schutzaria, the divine guardian of protection. The twelve goddesses that act as her retainers…”\n\n\n I began my prayer by saying her name and could instantly feel the mana swelling within me take shape—power meant to protect what’s important to me, not attack my foes, flowed from my entire body to my left arm, where it began to stir like a whirlpool.\n\n\n Just by saying her name in my prayers, I instantly felt the mana in my body manifesting, this was the power to protect those I loved, and it will not injure my enemies. I allowed the mana to flow to my left arm and it began to take the shape of a whirlpool around my arm.\n\n\n “Myne! Form the shield over the God of Darkness barrier, so that your mana isn’t consumed!” warned the High Priest.\n\n\n “Myne! Put the shield around the mist so that your mana does not get nullified!” the High Priest gave his advice.\n\n\n I gave a small nod while keeping my eyes on the mist beneath me. Thanks to the prayers I had been forced to memorize for rituals, the words flowed easily out of my mouth.\n\n\n I nodded my head slightly and locked onto the mist swirling. It was because I had been forced to memorise all the prayers for the temple affairs that I could recite it easily.\n\n\n “Please hear my prayer and lend me your divine strength. Grant me your shield of wind, so that I might blow away those who mean to cause ill.”\n\n\n “Hear my calls for your divine powers - your protective wind that will gush away those who harbour malicious intents.”\n\n\n The yellow feystone on the bracelet the High Priest had given me shone the brightest, for it was the divine color of Schutzaria the Goddess of Wind.\n\n\n The yellow feystone embedded in the bracelet was shining the brightest because yellow symbolised the Goddess of Wind.\n\n\n My mana was building up and it shot out a bright beam of light towards the carriages. I imagined my mana forming a dome over the black mist without making contact with it, the dome formed smoothly without any issues. With the finished dome, a sharp sound of metal clinking rach through the air. From the bird’s eye view, I saw that the carriages and back mist were encapsulated in a clear but red dome.\n\n\n “HAAAAH!”\n\n\n The attackers continued charging, completely oblivious to the newly formed shield, or maybe because they were too engrossed in trying to attack. The first ones to hit the barrier were all hit by a strong gust of wind and were launched into the air.\n\n\n “Nguh?!”\n\n\n “Huh?!”\n\n\n “W-What just happened?!”\n\n\n Some were sent flying far back, while some fell over and crashed into the others behind them. They just looked shocked and stared at the shield, confused by what just happened to them.\n\n\n “…That’s amazing,” Karstedt looked down at what just happened with amazement. He approved of the shield I had set up to protect Fran and Rosina.\n\n\n “Really?! You find this amazing right, Lord Karstedt?! This really is the Goddess of Wind’s shield! I offer my thanks to the goddess who has protected Fran and Rosinga!”\n\n\n I yelled and shot my hands up in the posing position. I was well surprised how powerful the shield I made was.\n\n\n “Enough with your prayers!” Sylvester roared when he saw all these.\n\n\n …But isn’t it right to offer my prayers and thanks for the goddess who has granted me her power?\n\n\n Of course, I didn’t say that aloud and just continued looking on below me, where the men kept charging back into the shield.\n\n\n They were repeatedly sent flying back by the winds and the crashed into those standing behind them. They finally gave up after a few more tries.\n\n\n “There’s mana coming from the forest,” Damuel said out of the blue and everyone looked at him. The fact that someone else’s mana was present meant that they were trying to tamper my shield or to assist the men in their charges against the wind.\n\n\n I learnt that those with more mana had more difficulty detecting those lesser than theirs, as such Damuel, a laynoble with less mana could sense the mana that the others couldn’t. This made everyone’s gaze serious, just then the High Priest gave orders to each of us.\n\n\n “Sylvester, Karstedt and I will enter the forest. Damuel, you will keep your position here and continue protecting Myne.”\n\n\n Damuel nodded at his orders but Sylvester protested with a “No!”, shaking his head.\n\n\n “Damuel, come closer!” Sylvester said as he stood up from the lion and he jumped onto our flying horse’s wings, like a swift and professional ninja.\n\n\n “AHH! What are you doing! That’s so dangerous!”\n\n\n Since the horse was made out of stone, it remained strong and sturdy in the air even with Sylvester on its wind. With his arms spread with for balance, made his way to us swiftly\n\n\n “Don’t block me,” Sylvester said and squeezed his hands under my arms, pulling me up from my seat and I started to sway around.\n\n\n I was still trying to process what just happened to me when I saw my vision swirl. I could do nothing but blink.\n\n\n In the next moment, Sylvester yelled “Ferdinand, catch!” and I was thrown up into the empty air."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Um?”\n\n\n I was set up into the air without any warning. I froze and stared straight ahead into the broad blue sky that stretched beyond the horizon. I didn’t bother struggling because there was nothing for me to cling onto.\n\n\n “Apprentice?!”\n\n\n Everything around me slowed, I watched Damuel trying to stretch out to catch me, he looked shocked to see me launched in the air, all while Sylvester jumped and sat behind me.\n\n\n I stopped for a while in the air as I reached the highest point of his throw, but I soon began plummeting down because of gravity.\n\n\n As I began falling, the wind caused my hair to slap against my face, my face starting throbbing from the pain, the pain pulled me back to my senses. I gave a yell when I realised I had been sent on a one-way bungee jump, that my safety and mental health had been neglected.\n\n\n “GYAAAAAAAAH!”\n\n\n “Got you.”\n\n\n The High Priest knew where I would land by deducing the trajectory, he flew his highbeast over to catch me.\n\n\n I only dropped for a meter, but it felt a hundred times more. I clung to the High Priest, trembling in fear for having just been helplessly falling through the air a moment ago. I knew I was now safe, but that didn’t stop the trembling.\n\n\n “I-I was… so scared…”\n\n\n “I am sure you were.”\n\n\n The High Priest tried to sooth my nerves by patting my back. But the culprit of my suffering, Sylvester’s voice, made me feel terrorized again.\n\n\n “Ferdinand, stay here! We don’t know if the person in the forest is a decoy!”\n\n\n “Very well.”\n\n\n “The border is closeby, we need to hurry before they cross it. Let’s go, Karstedt!”\n\n\n “Yes, sir!”\n\n\n Karstedt responded back and they zoomed off on their highbeasts, heading towards the forest.\n\n\n I heard the High Priest mumble as they flew off.\n\n\n “He made a very reckless decision, but he did it with the intention of protecting you. Please forgive him, on my behalf.”\n\n\n “Wah?”\n\n\n “Damuel is needed there to detect the culprits in the forest. In any likelihood that they are decoys, it would be too dangerous to leave you with Damuel alone.\n\n\n The High Priest continued to watch our surroundings with his guard up. I knew that I was in a very precarious situation right now, but that didn’t mean I should back down in fear.\n\n\n “Myne, will you offer them a prayer for a successful battle?”\n\n\n The High Priest suggested what we could do as we stayed back from the battle in the air, and I took the suggestion with a nod. It would distract me from my fears right now.\n\n\n The High Priest quickly taught me the prayers and we chanted it in sync.\n\n\n “O God of War Angriff, and his loyal twelve retainers, we offer our prayers so that you may give them your divine protection.”\n\n\n With our chants, the bracelets on our wrists began glowing with a blue light, and a ray of light was emitted from the blue feystone embedded in it. The lights swirled together and shot out towards the others who were rushing to the scene.\n\n\n Sylvester took out his shining wand and swirled it, summoning a large red bird that flew towards the forest.\n\n\n I watched the phoenix looking bird spread its large wings before disappearing into the air.\n\n\n Right where the bird disappeared, a red and clear wall manifested itself. He summoned another similar bird, but it was yellow this time. The yellow bird circled the vicinity, scattering glowing powder as it slowly disappeared.\n\n\n While the red bird had manifested a wall, Karstedt had his wand transformed into a double-edged two-sided sword. The enormous sword began glowing with multiple colours and he raised it up with a battle cry.\n\n\n “GAAAAAAAAH!”\n\n\n A beam of light came down with the swing of his sword and he slammed in down into the forest.\n\n\n “Bweh?!”\n\n\n A shrill and deafening sound ripped through the air, as if a meteor had cut through the sky and crashed into the earth. The explosion from his swing created an earthquake and it obliterated a portion of the forest. The effects of the blast made an impact on the shield I made, draining away some of my mana.\n\n\n “He overdone it…” the High Priest’s comment pulled me back to my senses.\n\n\n I looked back up at him and asked anxiously, “The carriages! Are the carriages alright?!”\n\n\n “They appear fine because of the protection of the Darkness and Wing shield.”\n\n\n “Ha…” I let out a breath of relief that the carriages were safe. As I no longer felt anxious, a wave of nauseous washed over me and I clung onto the High Priest for support.\n\n\n “What is the matter, Myne?”\n\n\n “My body seems to have lost all its strength when I realised everyone is safe. I kind of feel cold.”\n\n\n When I told him how my body now felt weak and cold, the High Priest just gave a confused look and placed his hand on my neck.\n\n\n “Your body does feel cold. Did you overuse your mana?”\n\n\n “…Huh? Oh, maybe.”\n\n\n I recalled that this had happened to me before at my first offering in the temple. I didn’t feel this bad the last time because I still could use my leftover mana to circulate around and heal my body. I tried to do that again this time, but I must have used all my mana to summon the wind shield and perform the Spring Prayer rituals. I had always been struggling to contain my mana in a box, not having sufficient mana to do something was a first, so I was completely clueless at what I should do now.\n\n\n “High Priest, I think I ran out of mana, I can’t make it flow in my body,” I explained and the High Priest looked at me with shocked eyes.\n\n\n “You’re out of mana? I have potions for serious cases like this but they are currently being stored in the carriages. We will need to wait until it is safe before we retrieve them. Until then… you can drink this. It is not the best solution, but you will have to do with it.”\n\n\n The High Priest dug through the storage under his belt to take out a golden ornament that resembled a test tube. He placed a small circular stone on it and it popped open. He moved it towards me and its contents didn’t smell like that horrible potion. I took a big mouthful and was surprised by the sweetness that ariated my mouth.\n\n\n The potion tasted a bit familiar, like the one he had me drink before searching my memories. And I also started feeling sleepy too.\n\n\n “Relax and just fall asleep. The next time you’re conscious, you will get scolded and drink the potion you dislike.”\n\n\n I did my best to nod my droopy head before sleep finally took over.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n “Sister Myne, have you come to?”\n\n\n “…Rosina.”\n\n\n I woke up to see Rosina looking at me, she seemed to have been guarding me the entire time as I slept deeply\n\n\n I slowly raised my body when I saw her, but my vision started spinning, it felt as though I was anemic. In the end, my body slammed back into the bed.\n\n\n “Please don’t move around so recklessly. Do you remember that you overexerted yourself to protect the carriages and placed yourself in danger. The High Priest seemed quite angry about it.”\n\n\n “I’m ready for whatever lectures I have coming from him because he already said so before I fell asleep. Anyways, that’s not important, how are you, Rosina? Is everyone okay? Did anyone get injured or suffer in any other way?”\n\n\n I was worried about everyone’s safety, if I had done my job to protect them. The thought that I could have been in danger from overexerting myself did not cross my mind at all, not even the torturous lecture and horrible potion that awaited me concerned me right now. It would be pathetic for me to think that selfishly.\n\n\n “Everyone is safe. No injuries at all, nothing was damaged or stolen too.”\n\n\n “Really? Thank goodness.”\n\n\n My whole body relaxed when I heard about everyone’s safety from Rosina.\n\n\n Apparently, the carriages stopped when the darkness enveloped them. When everyone looked out the window to see what was going on, they were stunned when they saw the armed men charging towards them. They were ready for combat but the men just got pushed back by an unknown force.\n\n\n There was a bright light, then they heard shouts followed by an explosion. But the explosion didn’t nick them because of the force surrounding the carriages. They only realised they had been saved when they saw the High Priest arrive with the rest.\n\n\n “You were the one who went through the most, Sister Myne. You were unconscious and your body was so cold that you shivered uncontrollably,” Rosina continued on as I felt my consciousness fading again.\n\n\n “…Usually, the farmers take more importance than gray priests, because they contribute food and taxes. It was only because of you that we were saved, thank you so much, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n When I came to, the High Priest came over and handed me a bottle with that horrible tasting green potion.\n\n\n “Drink it.”\n\n\n “Urgh…”\n\n\n I wanted to scoot away but I was still bedridden. The High Priest just gave me a stern look, telling me to stop running away because I needed the potion anyways.\n\n\n “Has your mana returned yet?”\n\n\n “…Not yet.”\n\n\n “I thought so. But we cannot continue staying here. Will you wait for me to pinch your nose and force it down?”\n\n\n We were stuck here until my mana was back. I didn’t want to become a burden because of that, so I had to force myself to take that horrible and awful potion.\n\n\n The High Priest stretched out his hand again and I took the potion with trembling hands, gulping it down as quickly as possible.\n\n\n “Ngh- Uergh!”\n\n\n My whole body spasmed and I covered my mouth with my hands, tears were welling in the corner of my eyes because of its taste.\n\n\n The High Priest observed all these and nodded with satisfaction.\n\n\n “Just hold your mouth shut and listen while you wait for the potion to work its effect.” He explained that they were unable to find out who was behind the dark barrier and attack.\n\n\n It sounded absolutely ludicrous, but apparently Karstedt’s attack had been so powerful that the enemies were completely obliterated, with whatever leads they had on them. There was no definitive proof that Gellach was involved. They only information they found was from Damuel, who detected two enemies, so that meant the culprits behind the attacks didn’t have much mana. They were incapable of summoning a barrier from the God of Darkness themselves, so nobles must have had helped them, and they could have been from another duchy.\n\n\n “How do you know that?”\n\n\n “Half of the men who attempted to attack the carriages did not come from our duchy.”\n\n\n He had no intentions to tell me how they figured out their identities. He continued to explain that there was probably a noble at the scene, they had summoned the barrier and fled back to the border before Karstedt’s attack.\n\n\n “…Wasn’t Lord Karstedt trying to catch the attackers?”\n\n\n “He said that he used his normal strength, but it turned out stronger than expected.”\n\n\n Karstedt was the most shocked by his own attack. The High Priest looked away with a trouble looked, and that alone told me the cause.\n\n\n “…Were our prayers not needed?”\n\n\n “Maybe, but do not bring it up unless someone asks you.”\n\n\n “Okay.”\n\n\n He proceeded to tell me that Sylvester and Karstedt had returned to the city immediately on their highbeasts as they needed this incident to be reported and investigated as soon as possible.\n\n\n “It’s out of this word for people to attack priests on the carriages, right? Was that why they needed to alert this to the archduke?”\n\n\n “…You’re right, I guess.”\n\n\n The High Priest gave a nod with a grim look before turning his gaze towards me, he asked me in a serious tone as I shifted my sitting position.\n\n\n “Myne, are you really intending to stay with your family?”\n\n\n “Yes, of course.”\n\n\n ‘`Then why did you let your mana get out of control again?” he questioned me and I gasped in response.\n\n\n “It was just… I was worried about Fran and Rosina.”\n\n\n “There was little damage this time because you directed your berserk mana into making a strong shield, but you still imposed a great threat to the others. And you were only ok because of the magic tool you had on hand that allowed you to make a prayer to manifest a spell. Without all these you would have died from your mana going on rampage.\n\n\n Basically, if one wished to use their mana, they needed to channel it through a magical tool. Magical tools were so crucial to children with Devouring, that if they didn’t have one they couldn’t channel their mana. Their mana would continue to grow and eventually kill then\n\n\n I was lucky to have been able to release my mana in the temple, but I would not be so lucky to survive if I go berserk with my mana.\n\n\n “Do you have any idea what happened to those who die as a result of their mana going on a rampage?”\n\n\n The High Priest proceeded to describe every detail to what happened to nobles who lost control of their manas. What made it worse was his indifferent reaction to it.\n\n\n “Their mana will slowly seep out from their body before exploding out. Their body will be unable to withstand their mana and it will begin its self-destructiion. Their flesh will swell and bubble - you can say, just like boiling water. The skin will finally reach its limit as the body pops and sends all the flesh and blood - “\n\n\n “GYAH! GYAAH! GYAAAAH! I’m not listening! I don’t want to listen! NOOOOOOO!”\n\n\n I blocked my ears with my hand and burrowed under the sheets. The High Priest just cruelly pulled the sheets off and plucked my hands away.\n\n\n “Control yourself, Myne. I’m not done.”\n\n\n “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’ll never do it again! I’ll never let my mana get out of control again! Please, I beg of you, have mercy on me! I don’t want to bubble! I don’t want to explode! Please stop!!!”\n\n\n I knelt down and slammed my head as close to the bed as possible, being completely traumatised. The High Priest nodded with a satisfied look.\n\n\n “That’s good. If you lose control again, I will bind you down to a chair and force you to listen to my full explanation. You’ll have no chance to block it out with your hands or run away.”\n\n\n I saw myself being strapped down and forced to hear every single traumatizing word. I shook my head furiously to desperately force it out of my head.\n\n\n “I’ll never do it again! I promise!”\n\n\n My sincere promise made the High Priest grin like a villain.\n\n\n “This will be useful for another time,” he said to himself, and that sent shivers down my spine."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n After I made my recovery, we continued the Spring Prayer for the remaining noble mansions. The rest of the trip went on smoothly and we returned to the temple in one piece.\n\n\n “Welcome back, Sister Myne,” Wilma greeted me with a smile.\n\n\n “Glad to see that you could do your job after all!” Delia teased me.\n\n\n “Thank you all for looking after my chambers during the time I was gone. Is everyone well?”\n\n\n My whole body relaxed when I saw Delia and Wilma in my chambers. This was where I was the most comfortable\n\n\n Fran and Gil were going in and out of my chambers, bringing in my luggage. On the other hand I went to my room, and was assisted by Delia out of my noble clothes for travelling and into my usual shrine maiden robes.\n\n\n “I’ll go prepare a warm bath for you.”\n\n\n “Thank you, Delia.”\n\n\n Delia, Wilma, and Rosina all tried their best to work together to unpack the stuff in my luggage and organise them neatly, but my luggage was gathering in my chambers at a greater speed. Soon enough, my chambers looked just like the mess it was in before my departure.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, please forgive me for disturbing you, I am here to convey the High Priest’s message that he needs you in his quarters now. It is regarding you returning home,” Fran took a break from unloading my luggage to quickly report to me on the second floor. He sounded a bit worried when he said this.\n\n\n I was waiting for the day I would finally get to return home with bated breath since I had finished my job for the Spring Prayer. The High Priest calling me over to discuss it literally made me spring up from my chair with anticipation.\n\n\n “I will meet him now.”\n\n\n “Rosina, may I have you accompany Sister Myne? I must return to unloading the boxes.”\n\n\n As I made my way down the stairs, I noticed that Fran and Hugo were working together to carry some luggage; they appeared to have gotten closer over the Spring Prayer. Ella was carrying the large bags with ease, she was quite strong because she had to handle heavy pots as a chef. I was surprised at how strong Gil was despite his small stature, he must be a lot stronger now that he got to eat more and did some laborious work in the workshop and forest.\n\n\n “I will be leaving my chambers to meet the High Priest. All the best on your work everyone.” I said before taking my leave.\n\n\n Just outside the noble section of the temple there were a couple of carriages parked there. I saw many gray priests unloading of luggage, and some of the priests from the workshop were there too. I recognised one of them carrying a large box.\n\n\n “I’m back. How is the orphanage doing?” I asked the gray priest and he looked surprised before giving a gentle smile.\n\n\n “Welcome, Sister Myne. The children have been learning lots. I’m sure they will be glad to welcome you at the orphanage.”\n\n\n “I will be happy to see them too.”\n\n\n After that the gray priest stepped aside to let me through, I nodded back to express my thanks and walked away as quickly as possible so that they could get back to work.\n\n\n “High Priest, I am here because you called. Huh… Brother Sylvester?”\n\n\n “Finally, you’re here Myne.”\n\n\n Sylvester was acting so unrestrained in the High Priest room like this was his own home. He was lying on the long couch and eating the fruits that were meant for guests. But the High Priest acted as though he wasn’t there and just continued ordering the gray priests who were moving around his luggage.\n\n\n “Um, High Priest. You called for me, right?” I asked him.\n\n\n The High Priest turned around and I saw his dead tired face, he then told me to sit down. I walked to the table and sat down. Sylvester shifted towards me.\n\n\n “It was me who called for you. I want to go on an excursion and you have to accompany me Myne, you’ll be my guide.”\n\n\n “…What on earth are you talking about?”\n\n\n I turned towards the High Priest to ask for an explanation, but Sylvester interrupted him before he could say a word.\n\n\n “Of course a guide will guide me, right? The first stop will be the orphanage, then your workshop and finally I want to take a look around the forest the orphans frequent,” he listed his demands so nonchalantly.\n\n\n Whatever he said made me anxious.\n\n\n None of the blue priests had expressed interest in the orphanage or the workshop until now. And the High Priest himself only read the reports about them without setting foot inside. Now there was an odd one, called Sylvester, who wanted to pay a visit. I couldn’t figure out his intentions.\n\n\n I tugged on the High Priest’s robes for help.\n\n\n “Calm down, Myne. I will be there too. I felt like this would be a good time to see the all the work you have done.”\n\n\n I sighed out of relief and placed my hand on my chest. Sylvester probably won’t go crazy with the High Priest there.\n\n\n “Except the forest though…” the High Priest continued. “The Noble’s District one should suffice for you.”\n\n\n He gave Sylvester a sharp glare, but there some exhaustion mixed in there, he was probably tired from the trip.\n\n\n “Na-ah, I want to go to the forest. I want to see her restaurant too.”\n\n\n Sylvester made another addition to his itinerary.\n\n\n “The restaurant is not done yet. I previously mentioned that the chefs are still being trained. But if you don’t mind me asking - High Priest, are blue priests even allowed in the lower city’s forest?”\n\n\n Going to the Italian restaurant by a carriage and a blue priest entering the lower city’s forest were two completely different things. The Noble’s District has its own forests, reserved only for the nobles. It was heavily guarded that any commoners that trespassed it would be executed on the spot. Just like the High Priest said, Sylvester could just go to the one in the Noble’s District.\n\n\n “I would like to see what the commoner’s forest has. Nothing will happen. A commoner can’t recognise a noble anyways. And even if I do, I’m confident that I can protect myself, so no issue there.”\n\n\n Sylvester flexed his arm and slapped it, giving a proud grin. He was really excited about it, but there was no way we were going to do whatever he wants.\n\n\n …High Priest, I’m relying on you to watch him.\n\n\n I turned my gaze to the High Priest with an expecting look, but he just rubbed his head he was in pain.\n\n\n “…Fine, you’re free to do so. Myne, you just need to report his every move.”\n\n\n Sylvester and the High Priest’s energy were on two completely different levels; Sylvester was awfully energetic, while the High Priest looked so exhausted that it seemed like he didn’t want to think anymore.\n\n\n I was shocked by the difference in these two, and that I had been assigned as Sylvester’s guide without any other say.\n\n\n I feel more like a ‘babysitter’, seriously.\n\n\n “Please take your leave, both of you.”\n\n\n The High Priest had dismissed us, but I clinged onto his sleeve tighter.\n\n\n I came here because I heard that I could return home soon, did I not? I didn’t just come here to be forced to become a guide.\n\n\n “High Priest, I heard that you wanted to discuss the details about me returning home. When will I be able to leave the temple?”\n\n\n I noticed that the light in the High Priest’s eyes shook before he looked back at me.\n\n\n “Yes, I did… It hasn’t been long since you passed out. Since your family would be unable to provide you with the proper care if you were to fall ill, you will rest here for three days. If you manage to get by without collapsing, you can leave the next morning. Do tell this to your family. And rest well for our sake.”\n\n\n “Ok!” I roared with joy.\n\n\n I was about to take my leave with Rosina when Sylvester suddenly stood up and approached me with the gray priest who was probably his attendant.\n\n\n “Ok, let’s go, Myne.”\n\n\n “Brother Sylvester?”\n\n\n “We’re going to my room.”\n\n\n “Um… But how about my rest…?”\n\n\n I shifted my gaze to the High Priest, signaling him for help. But that was futile because just gave me a shrug and shook his head, telling us to leave. Sylvester was glad to do so, but I wasn’t.\n\n\n Rosina and I exchanged looks of defeat, and we had no choice but to follow him.\n\n\n “Hurry up, it’s right there.”\n\n\n Apparently Sylvester’s room was next to the HIgh Priest’s. I was surprised when he opened the door to his room. It was almost barren, it only had the bare minimum of furniture. I was expecting an man-child like Sylvester to flood his room with the things he liked or things related to his hobbies.\n\n\n “Myne, I know you’re going to the forest with the orphans too. You probably wouldn’t want the High Bishop to know that, hm?”\n\n\n Sylvester gave a haughty smile, he was totally trying to blackmail me.\n\n\n The reason why I was avoided by the blue priests was because of the High Bishop’s obvious disdain for me. I frowned, feeling suspicious about Sylvester’s intentions.\n\n\n “Why are you so determined to go to the forest…?”\n\n\n “To hunt.”\n\n\n I was surprised by his answer.\n\n\n “To hunt? Where did you hunt previously?”\n\n\n I still didn’t understand why he insisted on going to the forest in the lower city.\n\n\n “Of course the one in the Noble’s District.”\n\n\n “Then just do your hunt there again.”\n\n\n “No way, it’s so boring.” Sylvester complained about all the problematic things he had to go through in the Noble District’s forest.\n\n\n First, you needed to seek an approval from the overman prior to the visit, and you could only enter at the fixed time assigned to you. You couldn’t just walk into the forest whenever you felt like it. Though there was an important hunting competition held annually, there were limitations to your hunt because of the noble hierachy. The forest was basically a means for the nobles to praise and suck up to the archduke, there was no real fun there if you wanted to hunt seriously.\n\n\n I had to agree that the nobles’ forest was much too strict with its rules for Sylvester to enjoy. He was a child stuck in a man’s body, he desired a place to challenge himself, and people who would sincerely praise him, and of course somewhere to enjoy hunting.\n\n\n “I understand your sentiments, but it will be difficult for you to enter the lower city’s forest with such clean clothes.”\n\n\n “Then you shall get me some dirty clothes from the lower city.”\n\n\n “…I’m assuming that you will have your attendants with you, will you make them wear dirty clothes too?”\n\n\n It was an easy feat for me to get some cheap clothes from a thrift shop, but I didn’t know how many sets he required. But it seems like Sylvester was confused from my question.\n\n\n “What do you mean?”\n\n\n “I’m asking how many people will accompany you.”\n\n\n “No one. I need attendants in the temple but not in the lower city.”\n\n\n My gaze shifted to the empty space between Sylvester and his attendant who was pouring the tea for us.\n\n\n “…Is the High Priest aware of this?”\n\n\n “I don’t need Ferdinand’s permission, do I? It’s true that you are a commoner he is protecting, but it’s not like I need his permission for this.”\n\n\n He ended off with a confident statement of “Everyone knows that.”\n\n\n My head dropped down. Of course, it’s not like a blue priest needed the High Priest’s permission for everything.\n\n\n Even so, I couldn’t help thinking that just like me, someone needed to watch this Sylvester person constantly for his own sake.\n\n\n “Well then, our first stop will be the orphanage, then the workshop. We’ll meet again in two days.”\n\n\n “…Um, Brother Sylvester. If you don’t mind me asking, will you be going to the orphanage to seek flowers from a shrine maiden?” That was the only reason that popped to mind why a blue priest would want to visit the orphanage.\n\n\n But my question made Sylvester’s expression change to one of ire and disgust.\n\n\n “Myne, children shouldn’t talk about that. So you want to start chirping ‘poowee’ that badly again?”\n\n\n “No, I didn’t mean anything bad. It’s because I’m the orphanage director…”\n\n\n I was going to hide away the shrine maidens old enough to offer flowers, if Sylvester was going to ask for flowers. Thankfully, based on his reactions, it didn’t seem like he was going to do that.\n\n\n “Do you seriously think I’m so desperate for a woman that I would turn to the orphanage?”\n\n\n “Huh? Don’t blue priests usually do that?”\n\n\n It would appear that the whole time I was under the false belief that the blue priests targeted the gray shrine maidens because it was difficult for them to leave the temple.\n\n\n I tilted my head, interested to know more. Sylvester paused for a moment and bit his lip, before clearing his throat.\n\n\n “…With my charisma and looks, a man like me can easily find a woman in the Noble’s District.”\n\n\n “Sure.”\n\n\n As long as he wasn’t harbouring some licentious thoughts towards the gray shrine maidens, I had no issue listening to Sylvester boasting how attractive he was to women in the Noble’s District.\n\n\n I gave him my assurance that I would get him a set of dirty clothes and departed with Rosina.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n After I was back in my chambers, I told my attendants who were busy with my luggage to gather. I needed to tell them about the plans with Sylvester and the High Priest.\n\n\n “The High Priest and another blue priest will be visiting the orphanage and workshop in two days.”\n\n\n “In two days?!” My announcement made everyone shout in unison.\n\n\n It was no surprise that everyone acted this shocked. But only Delia remained unbothered because she didn’t go to those places.\n\n\n This had been a very abrupt plan from a noble. Normally such plans would have been told in advance because a lot of things needed to be prepared. But the problem now was that Sylvester had fixed the date way too soon.\n\n\n “Please make sure the orphanage and workshop is spick and span. Other than that, everyone will continue with their daily routine.”\n\n\n There wasn’t anything secretive in the workshop that we needed to conceal. Even if there was, I knew myself best, that I was bad at hiding things and things always turned for the worst. So it would be a wise decision for me to be honest from the start.”\n\n\n “Sister Myne, if a blue priest is visiting the orphanage…” Wilma didn’t finish her words as her face flushed pale.\n\n\n I reassured her with a shake of the head.\n\n\n “Don’t worry, Wilma. They will not be going over to demand for flowers. They only wish to look around the workshop and the newly restructured orphanage.”\n\n\n Though Wilma nodded back, she still looked very frightened. Even more so now that she was trembling.\n\n\n I couldn’t bear to see her like this, but there was little I could do since Sylvester had put his foot down on this. There was no way to avoid his visit.\n\n\n “Wilma, I do understand your concerns, but you cannot avoid this as you are the overseer of the orphanage, you need to be there as they might have questions.”\n\n\n “I understand.”\n\n\n Wilma clasped her hand, knitting them together tightly.\n\n\n Disappointment overwhelmed me for not being able to help Wilma.\n\n\n “Gil, is Lutz or Leon around? If either one of them are, please call them over. I would like to tell them to notify Gilberta Company about the upcoming visit.”\n\n\n “They’re both in the workshop. I’ll go over and see if they’re free now,” And hence Gil left for the workshop.\n\n\n I walked downstairs to the first floor’s hall to meet Lutz and Leon. My attendants dispersed and proceeded to pack away the empty boxes into the male attendant rooms across so that the room would look more spacious and presentable.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n “Hi, Myne. It’s nice to see you again.”\n\n\n “Lutz! It’s been a while!”\n\n\n I dashed up to Lutz to give him a big hug. This was the longest I had gone without seeing him because of the Spring Prayer.\n\n\n “So much has happened I don’t know where to begin,” I lamented. “I feel so drained.”\n\n\n “Sounds like you’ve been through a lot,” said Lutz, but before I could lament the details about what I had been through, someone called out behind me.\n\n\n “Can you both leave the talking for later and tell me why I was called over too?”\n\n\n “Oh, Leon is here too.”\n\n\n “I have been the whole time.”\n\n\n Leon was the Ieherl that the Gilberta Company requested to be trained as a waiter under Fran over the winter. Though his coming of age ceremony was around the corner, he looked quite small for his age, which made him look like a kid trying to act like a grown up. Benno reassured me that he was a well-trained Ieherl he hired, but I didn’t see him in a good light because he was quite rude whenever I came looking for Lutz for comfort.\n\n\n “You don’t need to be here, Leon. You can go back.”\n\n\n Lutz patted my head.\n\n\n “Myne, calm down. You need to tell the Gilberta Company about something important, right?”\n\n\n I nodded my head and looked up to Leon while clutching onto Lutz.\n\n\n “In two days, the orphanage and workshop will be visited by the High Priest and another blue priest. And the blue priest had expressed interest in the Italian restaurant too. Please inform Benno about this. He will surely want the opportunity to meet more nobles.”\n\n\n “Yes, I will do so.”\n\n\n Leon knelt on the floor and raised his arms across his chest smoothly. Though he always got annoyed whenever I acted clingy to Lutz, he was still very serious when it came to work affairs.\n\n\n “That is all I needed to tell the Gilberta Company. I only need to tell Lutz another personal request,” I said.\n\n\n Hearing this Leon stood back up and gave me an annoyed look and left after saying “I’ll take my leave first.:\n\n\n “What do you need me to do?”\n\n\n “The High Priest told me to rest here for three days and that I can return the next morning if I don’t collapse in the meantime. Do you mind telling this to Mum and the rest of my family?”\n\n\n “No problem. But really… it’s been a while, huh?” Lutz’s voice dipped, I could hear the tremble in his voice as he tried to hold back his emotions from pouring out. I hugged him back.\n\n\n The only reason why I was able to survive not being able to go home was because Lutz and Tuuli still visited me and I could hug them for comfort.\n\n\n “I also need some worn clothes the size of Died. Something that a muscular and slightly tall guy can wear.”\n\n\n “…May I ask who it is for?” Lutz was curious.\n\n\n I didn’t find his question odd because anyone else would have asked the same too. But I didn’t know if it would be a good idea to say it aloud, so I stood on my toes and stretched myself to whisper it into Lutz ear’s as discreetly as possible.\n\n\n “It’s for the same blue priest who is visiting in two days.”\n\n\n Lutz gave an odd expression that I didn’t know how to describe. After a moment of silence he muttered out a “He’s a weird guy, isn’t he…?”\n\n\n “Yep, really weird. He wants to go to the lower city forest to hunt.”\n\n\n He was so weird that he would wear dirty and worn clothes just to hunt in the lower city’s forest.\n\n\n Lutz’s face scrunched up when he realised that he would be one guiding Sylvester to the forest, and I did feel bad for him. I wouldn’t want to do it too.\n\n\n “Well, there’s nothing we can do about it now,” he let out a sigh, “I’ll go buy the clothes tomorrow.”\n\n\n “Thanks, Lutz.”\n\n\n After settling that matter, we proceeded to discuss the progress the printing press with Johann’s letter pieces were making. We also had more paper in stock because the Myne Workshop had resumed business.”\n\n\n “I plan to start production again soon. Do you know if the Ink Guild has made some yet?” I asked.\n\n\n It didn’t matter if you made enough paper to fill the world if you didn’t have the ink to print. If we couldn’t outsource them we would have to gather soot and make them ourselves.\n\n\n “They have. Master Benno told me that they have hired the craftsmen to make the plant-based ink. Oh, the head of the Ink Guild has changed.”\n\n\n “Yeah, I heard. The High Priest told me of the previous head’s passing,” I replied, there was a silence after that as I clinged onto Lutz tighter. I wasn’t going to tell him that he was killed by the nobles that were after me. No way.\n\n\n “What’s wrong?”\n\n\n “Nobles are scary.”\n\n\n “Huh? You mean like the blue priest who is coming over tomorrow?” Lutz asked in shock, and that earned him a giggle from me.\n\n\n Nobles after me were scary, but Sylvester was scary in another way.\n\n\n “I guess so, he’s kind of a weird noble. I can never tell what he’s thinking, and that scares me. The first time we met he poked my cheek and made me chirp ‘poowee’.”\n\n\n “What even?”\n\n\n I told Lutz everything Lutz had done, like how weird he was when we first met and all the crazy things he did during the Spring Prayer. Lutz found this hilarious and kept laughing. He suddenly gave a cheeky smile and poked my cheek.\n\n\n “C’mon, Myne. Give me a chirp.”\n\n\n “Lutz, you’re such a bully! Poowee”"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n One day after my return from the Spring Prayer, everyone worked together to clean the orphanage and the workshop. Time passed quickly, and it was the day of the visit. Sylvester and the High Priest would arrive on the third bell, so everyone rushed to clean at daybreak.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, can ya come here? Uhm, I mean, do you have a moment?”\n\n\n “Yes I do, Gil. You’re doing a good job.”\n\n\n When I returned back from the Spring Prayer, I learnt that Gil had been trying to improve his manner of speech when I was gone. The gray priests who used to be attendants were teaching the kids better behaviour, and they would help Gil with his speech when they were in the workshop.\n\n\n “The children told me that since I am your attendant, I seriously need to work on my way of speaking so that I don’t make you feel embarra— Uhm, kehum. I mean, I need to speak politely so that I do not bring shame to you.”\n\n\n I was happy that the children were interested in changing their manner of speaking for their own sake, but I found it understandable why Gil didn’t like how they were making fun of him.\n\n\n “It is true that as my attendant, you would need to learn the proper way of speaking. It is very admirable for you to do this.”\n\n\n “Sister Myne, I will work my hardest… I don’t wanna— Uhm, I do not wish to be replaced.”\n\n\n Gil knelt in front of me. His brows were all scrunched up, I could tell he was vexed at himself, but I felt that his worries were needless.\n\n\n “What? Wait a moment, Gil. Have you been worried about that the whole time?”\n\n\n “There are plenty of people who are better than me,” his voice sounded strained as he said this, and he looked pitiful with his head hung down.\n\n\n He explained that the other children wanted to become my attendants after seeing that a troublemaker like him who frequented the detention room become one. They said if someone like him could become one, they could do the same too. He was anxious that he was easily replaceable and did his best to work on himself to best the kids.\n\n\n …Was that the reason why he spent so much time in the workshop? He wanted to learn new skills and because of that he also saw Lutz as his rival?\n\n\n Because I was sitting down, I was at the perfect height to pat Gil’s head. I stretched out and gently stroked his flaxen hair.\n\n\n “I know you have been going your best, Gil. I may hire more attendants depending on the circumstances, but you are irreplaceable to me.”\n\n\n “R-really…?”\n\n\n His face relaxed up with relief. Being an attendant was a tough job because they were replaceable to their masters. The thought of replacing Gil never occurred to me because he was quite good at his job.\n\n\n “Anyways, did you not want to speak to me about something, Gil?”\n\n\n “Yes. Should we continue our work in the workshop when the priests arrive?”\n\n\n “Yes, we will. They are here to see what we have been doing in the workshop. I know that everyone gets jittery with me in the room, and I imagine that it would be much worse when the High Priest and the other blue priest are here. But I hope that everyone will do their best. Will you please tell them that?”\n\n\n “Yes, master.”\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n Shortly after Gil left, Fran returned with a few people from the Gilberta Company. The group consisted of Benno, Lutz and Leon. Mark was not around because he had to look after the store.\n\n\n “Good morning, Sister Myne. It is my honor to be able to receive an invite on such a nice morning.”\n\n\n I led them to the second floor of my chambers and told Rosina and Delia to make their way downstairs. This was so that they would not hear us speaking casually.\n\n\n “Here you go, Myne. I got the clothes you needed. I decided to get a pair of shoes too.”\n\n\n “Thanks, Lutz.”\n\n\n I received the set of clothes and shoes, these needed to be given to Sylvester later today. Until then, I kept them on my work desk and walked back to the table. Benno was wearing formal clothes he usually wore to meet nobles today, and he was glaring at me now.\n\n\n “So, what do you know about this other blue priest?”\n\n\n “Nothing, really.”\n\n\n “Seriously?” Benno looked even more unhappy.\n\n\n I knew he was desperate for more information about Sylvester, but I seriously didn’t have any information he wanted.\n\n\n “It’s not like I would know anything about Brother Sylvester’s family, would I?”\n\n\n “You could have asked him. You need to learn how to get information for your own sake, fool.”\n\n\n It might be important for a merchant to get information about a customer’s family, but not for me, I just wanted to know how to avoid Sylvester. But I knew Benno’s scolding awaited me unless I said something, so I told him as much I had learnt about him from the Spring Prayer.\n\n\n “He’s kind of a weirdo. I’d use someone else’s way of describing him, that is he might seem bad on the surface, but he has a good heart deep inside.”\n\n\n “Come on, I don’t care for that. I need to know his family, who they are connected with, his status in the noble society, and any other beneficial information that will help me get him to buy my stuff and earn me some money.”\n\n\n “Oh shoot, my bad. I just spent the entire trip avoiding him as much as possible, so I can’t help you there.”\n\n\n I told him how I felt about Sylvester from the get go, which made Benno drop his head in disappointment.\n\n\n “You can learn all you want from him when I introduce you two to each other at the workshop. I’m sure that’s much better than hearing about him from me, Benno.”\n\n\n “You’re right, I shouldn’t have set such high expectations for you. I will just be glad that you still remembered to introduce me to him. I should be glad that you didn’t panic over their visit and forget to inform me of it,” Benno nodded to himself.\n\n\n I could say anything against that, which made me kind of disappointed in myself.\n\n\n “Right. I’ll see you later. Try not to mess up.”\n\n\n Benno’s interrogation with me turned out fruitless, so he left for the workshop with Lutz and Leon .\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n The third bell rung in the middle of my harspiel practice. I got up from my chair, sweating in nervousness. Fran took the set of clothes Lutz had bought under my request and walked in front while Damuel and I followed close behind.\n\n\n “Rosina, Delia, I trust that you both will look after my chambers.”\n\n\n “Yes, Sister Myne. We will wait for your safe return.”\n\n\n We arrived at the High Priest’s chambers, he was busy writing something at his desk while Sylvester was chilling in the room, seemingly prepared to leave anytime.\n\n\n “Pardon my tardiness,” I said.\n\n\n “Ok, let’s go,” Sylvester gave a short response.\n\n\n He looked so excited as though he was about to go off on some great adventure or a major quest of sorts. I didn’t know why he was acting that way because I didn’t think the orphanage and workshop would be that fun. Maybe it was because the Noble’s District did not have a workshop and this would be his first time seeing one.\n\n\n “Brother Sylvester, before we make a move… I have the clothes you requested for and prepared some wooden shoes that commoners wear in the lower city.”\n\n\n “You’re quite the fast one, ain’t ya? Not bad.”\n\n\n “They’re secondhand clothes. So we didn’t have to get them made.”\n\n\n Fran passed the clothes and shoes over to Sylvester’s attendant, who had a very complicated expression.\n\n\n I know you don’t want to touch a commoner’s secondhand clothes, but your master is the one who wants it.\n\n\n “You will all remain here. Fran and Damuel will suffice. The rooms will be too cramped if everyone tags along,” Sylvester ordered Arno and his own attendants. The orphanage was not that small, but it would be a little claustrophobic if everyone squeezed into the workshop.\n\n\n “Alright, let us depart.”\n\n\n The High Priest had completed his work and we made our way out. Fran was the guide, while the High Priest and Sylvester walked behind him, and Damuel and I stayed in the back.\n\n\n When we were walking to the orphanage, Sylvester could no longer stand my walking speed. He turned around and pointed at me to say “Damuel, grab her. She’s ridiculously slow.”\n\n\n “…Couldn’t you have been more tactful about it? You could have used the term “carry” instead.”\n\n\n “A bodyguard should always have their hands free, but since I’m stronger than Damuel everything will be fine.”\n\n\n Even though Sylvester had said all that, I was trying the hardest I could to walk faster. It was because of Sylvester and the High Priest’s height that they walked much faster than my maximum running speed, so I struggled to keep up. Thankfully, Damuel was now carrying me because I was getting breathless.\n\n\n “This is the orphanage,” Fran announced as he opened the squeaky doors to the dining hall in the girls’ building.\n\n\n Inside the hall, we saw Wilma, two gray shine maidens and gray priests kneeling at our arrival. Behind them, the children who had yet to have their baptism started gathering. They were a little hard to see because of their size, but I could see them kneeling onto the ground. Benno advised us to stop the children from working today because it was kind of illegal for pre-baptised children to work.\n\n\n “Welcome, we are extremely honored by your visit to the orphanage.”\n\n\n “High Priest, Brother Sylvester. This is my attendant, Wilma. She oversees the affairs in the orphanage and is the sole caretaker of all the pre-baptised children.\n\n\n The High Priest gave an impressed look and nodded.\n\n\n “If my memory serves me right, you must be the artist for the art in Myne’s books. Your work is outstanding.”\n\n\n “T-thank you for your praise.”\n\n\n Wilma was surprised at having been praised by the High Priest, so her voice sounded a little wobbly. She was surprised that the High Priest would remember a mere gray shrine maiden.\n\n\n Her hair was neatly tied up high on her head, so her crimson face and ears were in full view.\n\n\n “I expected the orphanage to be messy because of the children but it’s surprisingly clean.”\n\n\n Sylvester had walked right to the middle of the room and spun around.\n\n\n “Well, it’s because everyone here always does their best to keep it spick and span,” I declared with pride.\n\n\n The orphanage was always this clean thanks to Wilma’s efforts, she took charge of the cleaning here and taught the kids how important it was to keep themselves clean.\n\n\n “Are all the kids here as small as you? There’s no one younger here?”\n\n\n “…No…”\n\n\n There were no more littler ones because they had died of starvation and prior poor conditions. Sylvester should be aware of that, I was angry at how he playing the fool, but there was no point telling him off because that would not bring the dead back.\n\n\n “Rather, you seemed to have forgotten this again, Brother Sylvester, but I’ve had my baptism already.”\n\n\n “So? You’re still just as small as them.”\n\n\n When summer comes, it would mark one year since my baptism, yet I was still shorter than most of the children here. Sylvester ignored me who was puffing my cheeks in anger and drifted off to the other side of the dining hall. The boxes piled in the corner of the room had caught his attention.\n\n\n “Myne, what are in these boxes?”\n\n\n “They store all the books and toys that are used to teach the children how to read. These were all made here.”\n\n\n Sylvester fished out one of the children’s bibles and flipped through them. He then turned towards the karuta and the playing cards before frowning. The High Priest had also been looking at the toys, he picked up a set of karuta cards and gave me a glare.\n\n\n “Myne, I did not hear of these.”\n\n\n “They are called karuta. A type of card game for learning words. I initially made a set for my attendant who wanted to learn to read, but I decided to make more for the orphanage. I did not tell you about them because I didn’t think they would be important, they can’t be mass produced after all— Wilma has to draw all the art on every card manually.” I explained to the best of my ability.\n\n\n The High Priest pondered about something as he rubbed his chin.\n\n\n “…I would like to double check this, so you have not been selling these?”\n\n\n “Yes, though I did patent them to Benno, he is not planning to make them anytime soon.”\n\n\n Benno said that the cards were profitable, but I knew he was not planning to put them in the market yet. It might be because he’s having trouble finding a talented artist.\n\n\n “Anyways, it was because I had to read the bible that I learnt the names of all the gods and their divine tools, that I could make the karuta cards. The orphans are quite adept in this game, they have memorised all the cards.”\n\n\n “Really? Then I would like to see a game in person. Go on.”\n\n\n Sylvester had made a demand out of the blue, which sent the children into a nervous fit as they looked frantically between me and Wilma. I had a strong feeling that Sylvester was going to say that, so I was quite calm. I picked up the karuta cards and gave a gentle smile to the children.\n\n\n “I will go ahead and read the cards, will everyone handle the rest themselves?”\n\n\n “Yes, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n The children were very nervous around the unfamiliar blue priest, but they started to relax when they fell into the beat of the game.\n\n\n “This child took the most cards, so she wins.”\n\n\n “Well done,” Sylvester praised the winner.\n\n\n The High Priest watched the children pack up the karuta cards. He bowed his head down to look at me.\n\n\n “Myne, you can remember all of these? And the children can read all the words on the cards?”\n\n\n “Yes, the children can read the cards and the children’s bible too. They learnt how to over the winter.”\n\n\n “… Just over the winter? Seriously?”\n\n\n Sylvester got a huge shock that his eyes widened. I was proud of the children and bobbed my head up and down.\n\n\n “That’s right. There’s nothing much to do when you’re stuck inside because of the snow, right? The older kids could work in the workshop, but not the little ones, so they just studied the books and played karuta. The other set of cards helped them learn the numbers too. They can now do some simple calculation.”\n\n\n With my head held high, I listed the impressive feats the temple school achieved over the winter. But the High Priest did not seem impressed, instead he just held his head between his hands.\n\n\n “Myne…” he sounded extremely troubled, but I was sure Fran had reported this to him.\n\n\n “What’s the matter, High Priest?”\n\n\n He hesitated to say more, he just let out a sigh and said “It can wait” instead.\n\n\n He looked like he was trying his best to hold back.\n\n\n …Why does it feel like I’m going to get scolded? Something feels really off.\n\n\n I dropped my head to the side, expressing my confusion. Just then Sylveter patted my shoulder.\n\n\n “Anyways, let’s go to the workshop.”\n\n\n “Sure.”\n\n\n I continued walking at my usual speed and made my way down the stairs of the girls’ building to the back exit.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, I do not think it would be appropriate to bring a guest through there…” WIlma told me with an anxious voice.\n\n\n I realised what she was referring to and froze before turning back around. It was definitely not appropriate to take a guest there. But my movements earned the suspicion of the two priests that I was trying to conceal something from them. This made their faces turn grim as they looked down the stairs.\n\n\n “Wait. What are you hiding behind that door?” the High Priest interrogated me.\n\n\n “It’s just a back exit to the workshop we usually take from the orphanage. Since you and Brother Sylvester are visitors, it is only appropriate that I guide you there in the right manner. It just slipped my mind,” I explained.\n\n\n This made the High Priest frown.\n\n\n “…An orphanage with a back exit? I have never heard of such a thing.”\n\n\n “We will go through there.”\n\n\n And so we went down the stairs with Wilma in the lead, followed by me.\n\n\n The kitchen was located in the basement of the girls’ building and they were cooking lunch right now. We could hear lively chatter and a pleasant smell wafted into our noses. The chattering stopped when they saw Wilma rushing down the stairs. When the priests and I arrived in the kitchen, the large pot filled with soup was unattended and boiling, and everyone had lined up against the wall, kneeling.\n\n\n “Hm, so this is where you cook for the orphans?”\n\n\n “Yes, but we only make soup here most of the time.”\n\n\n I began telling them we needed the soup because the divine gifts were too little. The two priests had likely never stepped into a kitchen their whole lives because they kept staring at the pot like a curious cat.\n\n\n “This soup looks just like the one we had during the Spring Prayer.”\n\n\n “It is, I gave them the same recipe.”\n\n\n Sylvester squinted his eyes to glare at me.\n\n\n “I don’t see why orphans should be eating this every day?”\n\n\n Those words made me angry. The reason why the orphans had been forced to enter the forests to earn their share of money and cook their own food was because the number of blue priests and priestesses had been dwindling, such that they did not have enough divine gifts. But there was no point telling all of these to Sylvester.\n\n\n “Anyways, I heard that you make commoner sweets of sorts here, am I right? Damuel reported that to me.”\n\n\n The High Priest words made Sylvester dumbstruck.\n\n\n “Sweets?! That’s going too far!”\n\n\n “You might think that we are going overboard, but these are not the sweets that use the sugar and honey the nobles buy from stores. We can only make these sweets when we get the necessary fruits on clear winter mornings. They are rarely made. The orphanage has so many children that each person can barely get a mouthful. But the sweets are worth the effort because of their amazing taste. You think so too right, Sir Damuel?”\n\n\n Damuel nodded his head fervently as he looked back and forth between Sylvester and the High Priest, they both stared daggers at him. Sylvester’s gaze was particularly violent because he was jealous of Damuel.\n\n\n “It must be nice here, hm Damuel?”\n\n\n “I very seldom get to come here. I have suffered more, really.”\n\n\n Damuel had a tough job being my bodyguard, his soul would leave his body everytime I passed out and he was so traumatised whenever with these nobles glared at him.\n\n\n “The soup will get burnt if we stay any longer, we move on to the workshop.”\n\n\n I was trying to urge them out of the room because I didn’t want Sylvester making another unreasonable demand that he wanted to eat a parue cake.\n\n\n We walked past the chapel towards the boys’ building.\n\n\n “We have arrived at the Myne Workshop” Fran announced and pushed the door open."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The boys and priests inside the workshop stopped their work, gathered by the wall and knelt down. The others from the Gilberta Company did the same too.\n\n\n “Now that it is spring, we have begun making plant paper again. Once we have made enough, we can start making the picture books.”\n\n\n Because they couldn’t go to the forest today, the boys in the workshop had been busy laying out the pulp and drying the paper.\n\n\n Sylvester looked around the workshop and snorted.\n\n\n “Myne, where do you make the toys?”\n\n\n “We only make them during winter, so now is not the time. We can just order the materials needed to make them but making paper comes first,” I explained.\n\n\n Sylvester blinked his green eyes, looking bamboozled.\n\n\n “Why would you make paper and picture books when the toys are more profitable and fun?”\n\n\n “That’s because I want books.”\n\n\n What’s the issue with using my own workshop to make what I want? Nothing. I didn’t start making books for the money. I just wanted them and the Myne Workshop exists for that purpose too.\n\n\n Sylvester’s mouth went agape, clearing in disbelief at what I said.\n\n\n “Wow… So you seriously just do whatever you want to?”\n\n\n “… I don’t want to hear that from you, Brother Sylvester.”\n\n\n Nobody was as carefree and did whatever they wanted like Sylvester. Sylvester and I exchanged glares after being offended by the opposite’s words. The High Priest, who had been watching us argue, rubbed his head.\n\n\n “That doesn’t change the fact that you both are give me headaches.”\n\n\n “Ngh…”\n\n\n “Let’s move on from this, Myne. I want to see the workshop in business. Everyone, get back to work!”\n\n\n Sylvester just completely ignored the High Priest’s brutal words and dismissed the gray priests so that they could get back to work. They swiftly stood up and returned to their posts. Sylvester’s demands just proved the point that he was crazier and wilder than me.\n\n\n As the gray priests resumed their work, the others from the Gilberta Company remained kneeling on the ground.\n\n\n “The High Priest already knows them, so I will introduce them to you only, Brother Sylvester. This is Benno from the Gilberta Company, and these are his Ieherl apprentices Lutz and Leon.”\n\n\n “Oh, so he’s the merchant that sells the goods made here.”\n\n\n Sylvester shifted his gaze from the busy workshop to Benno, Lutz and Leon.\n\n\n “That’s right. Most of the things made here are sold through the Gilberta Company. The restaurant is also owned by them. The Giberata Company would be glad to engage you in their business discussions.”\n\n\n “Is that so? Benno, you may raise your head. I give you permission to speak.”\n\n\n “I am honoured, sir,” Benno said as he titled his head up.\n\n\n But he froze when he made eye contact with Sylvester. He didn’t say his usual greetings and I only heard him gulp.\n\n\n “Benno?” I asked.\n\n\n It took Benno a while to squeeze out his greeting, “I am honoured by the blessing of the rivers of Flutrane the Goddess of Water who had brought us together for this serendipitous meeting.”\n\n\n Sylvester seemed to be thinking of something as he rubbed his chin with a sinister grin. Why does he resemble a predator looking at prey?\n\n\n “Benno, I’m quite interested in that restaurant of yours. I have always wanted a nice long conversation with you. Now, let’s go to the next room for that talk.”\n\n\n “Yes, sire,” Benno replied and stood up trembling. His face was so pale, the look on his face sent me calling out to Sylvester.\n\n\n “Brother Sylvester, please remember that you promised not to steal our chefs.”\n\n\n “…I wasn’t even thinking about that. We’re just purely going to have a talk about business.”\n\n\n “That’s fine, I guess.”\n\n\n Benno was good at talking about business, so I guess there wasn’t a need for me to get involved.\n\n\n “Myne, what is the purpose of this tool?” the High Priest asked me a question so I turned away from Sylvester who was walking away with Benno. The High Priest was looking at our original press that we were now modifying into the printing one.\n\n\n “This is a printing press. It’s not completed yet but it’s looking much better than when I saw it before Spring Prayer. I’m looking forward to this so much.”\n\n\n “How does it work? Damuel did report this but it was quite a vague explanation.”\n\n\n To show the High Priest how it worked, I called Gil over to show it to him firsthand.\n\n\n “Gil, please get the ink. High Priest, these are called letter pieces and are made of metal, you first have to put them in order to form the text you want.”\n\n\n “…Letter pieces? They closely resemble small stamps.”\n\n\n The High Priest picked up and rolled a letter piece in his hand. I asked Fran to help gather the letter pieces while I organised them to form a short sentence. Gil placed the ordered pieces in the forme and fixed it in with the two sliding boards on the side.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, it is ready.”\n\n\n “Could you help print a sheet? Please reuse a used sheet of paper so we don’t waste any.”\n\n\n Gil lifted the forme onto the printing press and applied some ink on it. Then slotted a piece of sheet onto the press.\n\n\n “My original plan was to make this part of the printing press movable such that if you move it over ,it will press down the letter pieces and distribute the ink evenly. But since we can’t make that yet, we will use a wooden plank to press it down. After that we can take out the paper and let it dry one side while we print the next. But for now we will try it out on this used sheet paper to save resources.”\n\n\n Gil repetitively printed the same sentence on the paper. The High Priest looked shocked by this. I told him with pride, how the completed press will be able to speed up production because it could press the ink down much faster than the plank.\n\n\n I was waiting for the High Priest to begin his fond praise of the printing press, but unlike what I expected he just pinched his forehead and sighed.\n\n\n “I now understand… why you said this will change history.”\n\n\n “Uhm… What?”\n\n\n I expected the High Priest to be excited over this because he had quite a collection of expensive books, but that didn’t seem so. He looked down at me and gave me a smile - but he definitely didn’t seem happy about it because his golden eyes weren’t smiling.\n\n\n “Myne, we will have a long talk about this.”\n\n\n …Huh? But I did get Fran and Damuel to inform him of this? Why did it turn out like this?\n\n\n That marked the end of the tour. Sylvester and Benno returned after a while, having finished their business discussion. Sylvester tried spreading the wood pulp and accidentally tore some of the paper when he placed them onto the drying rack, but that was within my expectations. Nothing was damaged in the workshop and Sylvester seemed quite happy, so I declared the tour a success in my heart. I knew that I would get an earful from the High Priest later, but, I should just be thankful that the tour was over.\n\n\n The only thing that caught me off guard was how ghostly pale and exhausted Benno looked after his talk with Sylvester. He walked with me back to my chambers, the moment we entered his head dropped down. He looked so drained that he couldn’t return without taking a break here first.\n\n\n “Benno, what on earth did Brother Sylvester say to you? I can help make a complaint to the High Priest if he did anything to you. That is if you want it.”\n\n\n I did not have the power to do much, but if Sylvester had been over the board with his actions the High Priest would definitely take some action. I thought that Benno would thank me for the offer but he just kept silent and dropped a fist onto my head.\n\n\n “Ow! What was that for?!”\n\n\n “…This is because of you,” he sulked with a complicated look and he raised his fist for another go.\n\n\n I clutched the top of my head for protection, shooting him a glare with tears in my eyes.\n\n\n “What did I even do?!”\n\n\n “I can’t say anything… I can’t, but just know that this is your fault.”\n\n\n “Was he trying to push you to trade the chefs?”\n\n\n That was the only thing that came to mind when it came to Sylvester troubling Benno. Contrary to my thoughts, Benno just blinked with surprise at my question and shook his head\n\n\n “No.”\n\n\n “Then what was it?”\n\n\n Benno continued sulking, looking vexed about something. He lifted his hand to roughen up his gelled hair and groaned.\n\n\n “…Never mind. At least I got a once in a lifetime opportunity here, but I’m not confident that I can live up to it.”\n\n\n “Well, I still don’t know what’s going on but all the best to you.”\n\n\n I tried to give him my well wishes for his success despite not knowing the situation, but that seemed to have just made Benno annoyed. He started pinching both of my cheeks.\n\n\n “Dat hurssch… Benno, would you like to have your lunch here?”\n\n\n “No, I wanna go home and organise my thoughts.”\n\n\n After he turned down my offer, he shot up his seat and made his way out of my chambers, dragging his feet on the ground like a deadbeat salaryman going home.\n\n\n Seriously, what on earth did Sylvester say?\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n Later that afternoon, I received two letters in my chambers. The first one was the High Priest invited me to his torture (lecture) room. The visit was set two days later, in the afternoon before I would return home. I quickly wrote my reply knowing that I might live through his lecture because I was going to be reunited with my family after that.\n\n\n The other letter’s sender was Sylvester. He thanked me for being the guide for today’s visitation and demanded that I continue to be the guide for his trip to the forest tomorrow. It was certainly troublesome to receive such an order, but it would be a hurdle for me to carry it out given that I was so feeble and would need a guard.\n\n\n “Sir Damuel, I don’t think it would be suitable for me to go to the forest, right?” I asked him while flicking the corner of the paper.\n\n\n Damuel, who would have to be my guard, gave a long sigh with an annoyed look.\n\n\n “Apprentice, do you think you are even capable of making it that far on foot?”\n\n\n “It’s possible. I did walk to the forest frequently before I was baptized… Just that it would always take quite some time.”\n\n\n The number of adult men that could withstand my slow pace was only a handful, so it meant that I was carried more times than I walked. But I was still very confident that I could walk some distance, just at a slower pace than everyone else.\n\n\n “Alright, let’s say that you can make it there on foot. Our main concern right now, is that as your bodyguard, I do not think it’s a wise choice to have a shrine maiden like you in a forest. It would be a much better choice to have someone else be his guide.”\n\n\n The person in question was Sylvester. Dad was not an option because his next break wasn’t til the day after next. Tuuli said that he planned his day off to sync the day I was coming home so that he could pick me up. Tuuli would likely do the same as him, so they both would be busy with work tomorrow.\n\n\n “The only possible one I could ask for help is Lutz, but that would be really stressful for him.”\n\n\n Lutz would be going to the forest tomorrow with the orphans if it was sunny, so it was a wiser choice to ask him. I prefered making Leon do it since he was older and better able to handle Sylvester. But being a merchant’s son, I didn’t think he would be familiar with the forest since his lifestyle rarely required him to frequent it.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n I was in the middle of my harspiel practice when Gil came barging in even though he had just left for the workshop a moment ago.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, the blue priest is already at the workshop! Uhm, I meant, the blue priest currently awaits in the workshop.”\n\n\n Gil’s first task of the day would be to open the workshop by second bell, and he would prepare the things first while the grey priests eat their breakfast. But today, when he went to open the workshop, Sylvester was already waiting by the door in the secondhand clothes with a smug look on his face.\n\n\n Seeing this, Gil ran back to the chambers to inform me. I placed down my harspiel and followed him back to the workshop with Damuel.\n\n\n I arrived at the same time breakfast was over in the orphanage. The gray priests and the children were already carrying their baskets, kneeling on the ground, waiting to head to the forest. Standing in front of them was Sylvester who had a bow slung across his shoulder.\n\n\n “Good morning, Brother Sylvester.”\n\n\n “You’re late, Myne.”\n\n\n He was glaring daggers at me, but it wasn’t my fault.\n\n\n “You arrived much sooner than the agreed time, Brother Sylvester. I’m sure you have noticed that you arrived before the others finished their breakfast. Just to note, I will not be taking you to the forest because I am not capable enough.”\n\n\n “Yeah, you walk way too slow. So, who’s going to be my guide?”\n\n\n Sparks were flying in Sylvester’s green eyes as he looked around fervently and his blueish-purple hair kept swishing behind him. His silver hair band looked out of place with the secondhand clothes he was in.\n\n\n “It’s usually Lutz or Leon who takes the children to the forest. You know, the Ieherls from the Gilberta Company. I’ll ask Lutz to take you there today, so please wait for him here.”\n\n\n I pointed to a box on the side and told him to take a seat, but he continued standing and walked around the workshop because he was too excited. I let out a long sigh.\n\n\n “Brother Sylvester, are you really interested in going to the forest?”\n\n\n “Of course I am. I even went all the way to get you to buy me these dirty clothes. Here, have a look. I look good in it, don’t I?”\n\n\n Sylvester looked so smug about himself and spread his arms to better show off his clothes. To be honest, it didn’t look good on him at all. In fact, it looked weirder on him that I thought it would have. There was no way he was pulling off this disguise, he looked just like a rich person cosplaying as a commoner for fun.\n\n\n Regardless, I could tell he was indeed looking forward to the hunting trip. He even wore some worn out leather boots with the secondhand clothes. He probably opted for the boots because the wooden ones would be too hard to walk in. Though the bow was way too fancy and well-crafted compared to those seen in the lower city. His appearance told me that he was just planning to go down to hunt.\n\n\n “Brother Sylvester, if you really wish to hunt in the lower city’s forest, please promise me that you will listen to everything Lutz tells you.”\n\n\n Sylvester’s expression turned grim when I said this.\n\n\n I knew as a commoner, I was much lower in status than nobles. Though in the temple, as fellow blue priests, we were of equal status here. The High Priest was not here to watch Sylvester, so I had to step up this time.\n\n\n “Just like that of the noble’s forest, we have rules in the lower city’s forest. There are different spots for hunting and gathering in the forest, and of course there are plenty of other unspoken rules for hunters. If you use your authority to break the rules and punish anyone who opposes you, then you shouldn’t have entered the forest in the first place.”\n\n\n Everyone in the lower city agreed on a wide array of unspoken rules, including the unbaptized children that went to do gathering. This was so that everyone could utilise the forest to its best. If anyone broke the rules, others might get hurt, if Sylvester were to do that, I would require the High Priest’s assistance in stopping him.\n\n\n Sylvester listened to me with a grave look, and he nodded back in response.\n\n\n “This will be my first time hunting there, so of course I will listen to my guide’s instructions.”\n\n\n Just then, Lutz and Leon walked in, both of them were in the appropriate attires for the forest.\n\n\n “Good morning, Myne. It’s quite rare for you to be in the workshop.”\n\n\n “Good morning, Lutz. Good morning, Leon.”\n\n\n “Good morning, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n After exchanging our morning greetings, they noticed that Sylvester had been looking at them with an inpatient look, so they rushed forward to greet him too. They didn’t hide their looks of surprise at seeing the blue priest from yesterday now dressed in dirty old clothes. I stepped forward to tell them that Sylvester expressed interest in hunting in the forest.\n\n\n “Lutz, I’m very sorry for the inconvenience, but I have to trouble you to take Sylvester to the forest. Leon and Gil, I trust that you both will look after the children as they work in the forest?”\n\n\n “As you wish.”\n\n\n Sylvester shifted his bow and trekked off towards the forest with Lutz and everyone else.\n\n\n “I keep thinking that something bad is going to happen.”\n\n\n “I’m sure that it will be fine. Let’s return to your quarters, apprentice.”\n\n\n I doubt Sylvester knows what’s best for him, I kept those thoughts to myself as we made our way back.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n Lutz came clambering into my chambers at about the sixth bell, right before the sun had set.\n\n\n “Myne, could we borrow your chefs? We need help with the load of meat we got.”\n\n\n I didn’t feel good about making my chefs do more stuff right before when they were about to leave, but it would be much better to get experienced people to butcher the animals. The work would be awfully slow if we had the children do it instead.\n\n\n “Fran, may I ask you to get Hugo and the others to help out? In the meantime, let’s go to the workshop, Sir Damuel.”\n\n\n The first sight that came into view was the blood and feather covered entrance to the workshop. I saw the children furiously plucking some dead birds. It didn’t take long for Hugo and Ella to arrive with their knives. They were surprised by the view and let out an impressed “woah…”. Sylvester heard this and puffed out his chest.\n\n\n “Look at this, Myne! Got a lot of them, hm? This is quite the sight, right? I did it all.”\n\n\n “Welcome back, Brother Sylvester.”\n\n\n It was surprising to see Sylvester this happy. It turned out he managed to hunt a small deer and four birds. Hugo and Ella took their knives and quickly got to cutting the deer.\n\n\n “Ella, it seems like the blood has already been drained, let’s work on taking out the guts first because they rot the fastest. It’s getting quite late so we can cook the meat tomorrow.”\n\n\n I just stood a good distance away from the professional butchers, trying to detach myself from the bloody reality I was looking at. Soon, the kids began cheerfully telling me what had happened during the day while plucking the birds.\n\n\n This was the first time they got to see how meat got prepared, and they were definitely excited seeing how they talked about it so cheerfully while plucking the feathers. They were growing and learning so much, and so was I because I used to scream and faint from the mere sight of blood.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, Brother Syl is so cool. A bird came crashing down from the sky, and apparently it was Brother Syl who shot it down with an arrow!”\n\n\n “We hooked it onto a branch and drained its blood, there was so much that the ground turned completely red.”\n\n\n “After that more animals came to eat the birds, but Brother Sylvester hunted them too! But we didn’t take them back because he said that their meat was hard and tasteless.”\n\n\n The children were so excited to tell me stories of Sylvester’s brave adventures, but the very thought of a bloody forest got me squirmish.\n\n\n Sylvester had a haughty grin on his face as he relished in the children’s high praise.\n\n\n “Brother Sylvester, you’re quite amazing to be able to hunt this much in a day. What will you do with them all? Would you like us to take them to your kitchen?”\n\n\n I suggested that as I thought that he would prefer his own chefs to butcher his meat, but Sylvester just shook his head furiously. It almost made me think that he didn’t want anyone finding out about it.\n\n\n “Nah, it’s fine, I don’t need them. Uhm… The kids can have it all.”\n\n\n “YAY!! Thank you so much, Brother Syl!”\n\n\n The children were overjoyed that they got the chance to eat more meat than they have ever had in their life. They were so excited that they showered Sylvester with more praises, and their eyes sparkled for a new profound food craving. (TL’s note: the second half of this sentence is a bit awkward, wasn’t sure how to translate it)\n\n\n “…Uhm, what’s with ‘Brother Syl’?”\n\n\n I just realised that the kids were addressing him by a nickname. I was a little nervous asking, thinking that Sylvester might get offended.\n\n\n “Oh yeah, they struggled to say “Sylvester’, so I gave them the permission to shorten it. But not for you okay?”\n\n\n “Why can’t I?”\n\n\n I was confused and cocked my head to the side. Sylvester let out a snort and gave me a teasing look.\n\n\n “It’s not like I’ll ever see the kids again unless I visit the orphanage another time. But it’s different for us, we will still see each other quite frequently. A dense kiddo like you might slip up and address me the wrong way at the wrong time.”\n\n\n It didn’t feel good that Sylvester called me dense, but I couldn’t say anything against that. My head dropped down as my mind began to subconsciously agree with whatever he said.\n\n\n “I guess you’re right.”\n\n\n Sylvester burst out laughing and poked my cheek.\n\n\n “I haven’t had this much fun for a while. I’ll give this to you as thanks.”\n\n\n Sylvester stretched out his fist and relaxed his fingers. Inside, the content was not what I was expecting (like a bug or twig from the forest), but a necklace with an onyx-looking gem.\n\n\n “Er, thank you for the gift. But what is it? Some sort of magic tool…?”\n\n\n “Kind of, but it’s not used to channel your mana. Praying with it will not do anything.”\n\n\n I nodded, recognising that it was probably a tool for a specific feature like the one used to block out sound. I raised my head to look at Sylvester.\n\n\n “So, what’s it for then?”\n\n\n “I’ll be leaving the duchy for a while. This is a protective charm. If you ever find yourself in danger, press down a drop of blood onto the gem and I’ll save you.”\n\n\n I didn’t think I would ever find myself in a situation where I would need Sylvester’s help, if I did need help, I could always look for the High Priest. But there was no harm accepting a gift.\n\n\n “Turn around, I’ll help you put it on.”\n\n\n I twirled around like Sylvester told me to, but he clicked his tongue.\n\n\n “Put your hair away. How am I supposed to put it on with it in the way? Have you never had a boy give you an accessory?”\n\n\n “I did receive a hairpin from a boy before.”\n\n\n Well it was Benno though. .\n\n\n But even as Urano, I had never received a necklace from a man. To to be frank, no one else other than my family had given me an accessory. So it was surely an astonishing feat to be gifted a necklace by a man before turning eight.\n\n\n …So it’s all about the looks? A pretty face is what it takes to be popular?\n\n\n I was always teased by my childhood friend Shuu from my last life, he said that I will never be popular as long as I was this crazily obsessed with books. But maybe he was wrong this time, I just needed to reincarnate.\n\n\n “Brother Sylvester, do I look cute wearing it?”\n\n\n “A protective charm is not supposed to be a cute accessory. Just wear it and never take it off. Just follow what I say.”\n\n\n …Sure I’m just a kid, but it wouldn’t hurt to praise me a little, right?\n\n\n I filled my cheeks with air, giving an exasperated look in response to Sylvester’s rude attitude. But my cheeks just enticed him to squish my cheeks with his palms, causing the air in my mouth to puff out. Not only did he not let go, but he squished them harder.\n\n\n “Myne, always keep this on you. Never take it off, not even for a second. Understand?”\n\n\n This was the first time I had seen Sylvester’s green eyes this serious."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Having to sit through another lecture with the High Priest and finally getting the chance to return home was like entering hell and heaven together. I was looking forward to seeing Dad and Tuuli later in the day when they would fetch me, but that also meant I had to sit through the High Priest’s migraine-inducing lectures.\n\n\n “Follow me, Myne.”\n\n\n “Yes…”\n\n\n Fran and Damuel accompanied me to the High Priest’s room. When we arrive there, just like what he had stated in the letter, the High Priest immediately told me to follow him to the hidden room (but it might as well be called a detention room now)\n\n\n I plopped myself down on the usual bench, while the High Priest walked to his desk to pick up a pen and a wooden board. He opened up a bottle of ink before taking a seat on his chair. He crossed his legs and bored down an intimidating stare.\n\n\n “I will not be lecturing you today. I hope you can recall how I said I had some questions. Let’s start. First off, I would like to know what are your future plans with the printing press.”\n\n\n So it turns out that he had made a list of questions he was unable to ask me during his visit at the Myne Workshop. He had summoned me here so that he could personally ask me his unanswered queries about the printing press book production’s potential and the speed it could produce them. Unfortunately, I could not give him an exact number.\n\n\n “We have yet to make a completed printing press. I will need to make much more metal letter pieces before we can produce books that only consist of words. In fact, we cannot begin the book production without securing a large supply of ink and paper, so it will be difficult to estimate how fast and much a printing press can do right now.”\n\n\n “I see…” the High Priest mumbled as he referred back to the questions on his board.\n\n\n “Moving on, I would like to talk about it’s impact on the world. When you start mass-printing, what impact will it have on those who copy books manually? Could you talk about what happened to these people in your past world?”\n\n\n “It was still around, but as a hobby, not a job. It’s not a very viable job because machinery can replace them easily. This process was a gradual one, but it took about two centuries before this job went out of date. It definitely wasn’t as fast as two decades.”\n\n\n My words made the High Priest knit his eyebrows together and he continued jotting down on his board.\n\n\n “Though you did mention that everyone in your country could get an education, and that it was the norm for people to be able to read, I don’t suppose that it was that way since day one. What was the impact of the widespread distribution of books and a boost in literary rate in your world?”\n\n\n “It was a revolutionary event. The impact it had on each country and its culture differed, but it’s not necessary to know the details because likewise, the impact on this world will be different.”\n\n\n “May I know what were some of the changes?” The High Priest prompted and I tried to pull out some examples from Urano’s world.\n\n\n There were quite a few examples I could think of, but I hesitated to tell it to the High Priest because. After all, he didn’t have the necessary knowledge so he would probably struggle to understand it.\n\n\n “There have been a couple of cases in history where the working-class peasants teamed up, learning and sharing knowledge together, so that they could gain the capabilities to overthrow the and set up their own ruling system. Conversely, some have used printing to mass-produce and distribute propaganda to influence the public’s sentiments. One thing for sure is that commoners becoming literate will influence how certain information is spread. I cannot answer who and how someone might take advantage of that.”\n\n\n “So you mean to say, it’s impact on society will be so drastic that predicting it is simply impossible. That sounds worrisome…” the High Priest words trailed off as his hands busied away writing on the board.\n\n\n “But this world is different from mine because mana is crucial here, right? There’s no saying the same thing will happen here even when books are more widely distributed and literary rates jump. Moreover, books can be used to inform the public how hard-working and crucial the nobles are to society’s well-being. Of course, things won’t turn out good if the nobles and priests are just telling black lies.”\n\n\n “What do you mean? The High Priest didn’t seem to quite understand what I just said. I gave him a shrug and continued.\n\n\n “Those living in the lower city have no means to find out what the nobles do. Only those in the farming towns get to witness the nobles and blue priests provide them with the mana-filled chalices that support them during the Spring Prayer. As such, they are much more religious and have a stronger faith in the gods than those in the lower city. This is just my speculation, by the way.”\n\n\n “The thought of the commoner’s faith in the gods has never occured to me, let alone telling them what the nobles do. I am very intrigued by what you have said, you provide new perspectives on untouched topics.”\n\n\n Because I was a commoner and had memories of another world, the High Priest seemed very interested in the new profound perspectives I could offer, be it literally or figuratively.\n\n\n “Hm… If that’s so… This is my decision now that you have answered my questions. Myne, the printing will have to be delated.”\n\n\n “Huh? Why?”\n\n\n “Though we can suppress any uprisings from the commoners with magic, the nobles won’t take the idea of printing too well.”\n\n\n The High Priest proceeded to explain that copy bookings manually was a stable and lucrative job. As such, it was a very crucial job for priests, shrine maidens and Royal Academy students of a lower-income background. If I were to introduce my books that only required printing, I would surely be despised by local laynobles.\n\n\n “…That means only the nobles’ might perceive this negatively?”\n\n\n We had never had run into conflicts with nobles till this point, and frankly, this terrified me. I felt a shiver run down my spine when the High Priest nodded,\n\n\n “You have only been printing books for the children and you did mention that printing has been limited because of your limited supply of paper. As such, there have limited impacts on the priests and nobles that would force you to halt production. But the situation will differ with the finished printing press, right?”\n\n\n The rationale behind the production of letter pieces was to rid the tedious process of manually cutting out every letter by hand. It was much better for text-only books to be produced with the metal letter pieces. This very idea was used back in Earth, and also caused manually copying books jobs to turn obsolete.”\n\n\n “So how long will we have to delay printing…”\n\n\n I asked in trepidation, I was surely going to suffer knowing that I could not print even if I a completed printing press on hand. The High Priest turned his golden eyes to me.\n\n\n “Until you have been adopted by Karstedt.”\n\n\n “Bweh?”\n\n\n “Any commoners that are a hindrance to nobles will be eliminated immediately. But things will be different if you are an archnoble’s daughter. Your business will receive the archduke’s support, as such it will prove difficult for the other nobles to target you.”\n\n\n A commoner girl like me was just a nobody, an easy target for any noble. But if I became the adopted daughter of an archnoble and seek the approval of the archduke, I could turn my business into a state one. In that case, the nobles that copy books for extra income could no longer attack me. Furthermore, the High Priest mentioned that I should attempt to drag the laynobles to invest in the printing business to remove any further opposition to mass-printing. Things were getting so serious that I couldn’t wrap my head around it anymore.\n\n\n …Am I really going to be able to wait two whole years to print, even though we already have a ready-to-do printing press? It’s already been two and a half years since I became Myne. Could I wait that long again with just printing picture books for children?\n\n\n The High Priest probably saw through me, he looked at me and lifted the corners of his mouth.\n\n\n “How about this instead, Myne? You could become Karstedt’s adopted daughter right now. That way you can start printing now.”\n\n\n I know he was trying to tempt me, and it did work for a split second. But the next moment I shook my head.\n\n\n “No… I can finally return home… I can’t bear to not see them again.”\n\n\n “Are you against becoming Karstedt’s adopted daughter that much?”\n\n\n “That’s not what I meant. Lord Karstedt is an amazing guy. Not only is he valiant and very dependable, he is an archnoble too. I can’t find a better adoptive father elsewhere.”\n\n\n But no matter what, I wanted to stay with my family. Two years was already a short time, I couldn’t bear to make our last time together even shorter.”\n\n\n “It’s a given that you would be homesick after being separated for this long. Well… do reconsider this when you get back home and have your share of love and affection with your family. Who knows, you might change your mind.” the High Priest gave a cheeky smile.\n\n\n He was totally doing this because he expected me to succumb to my love for books, and eventually proceed with the adoption before I turn ten. This made me clench my fist and glare right back at him.”\n\n\n “I won’t change my mind. I want to be with my family for as long as possible. Afterall, you are the one who made me realise how horrible I had been in my last life when I chose books over everything else and that I needed to better treasure my new family.”\n\n\n His magic tool was like a figurative slap in the face, it deeply engraved into my mind that once you lose something, you can never get it back again. I wasn’t going to become the person i was that abandoned everything around me for books.”\n\n\n My response made the High Priest’s grin change into a melancholic one.\n\n\n “You have a very strong conviction, I doubt you will go back on it. Very well. Have fun printing a sum of picture books for the next two years.”\n\n\n “…Thanks.”\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n “Myne, we’re here to pick you up,” Dad cheered.\n\n\n “Have you finished your talk with the High Priest?” Tuuli asked.\n\n\n I ran into Dad and Tuuli waiting in my chamber’s hall when I returned from the High Priest’s room.\n\n\n “Dad, Tuuli!”\n\n\n The moment I saw them, I felt the stone that had been weighing down my chest since the talk with the High Priest disappear. I ran towards them and leaped into Dad’s arms, leaving behind Fran Damuel who were still standing at the entrance.\n\n\n “Hold on!”\n\n\n Dad was prepared for me running to him and hoisted me up into the air. He spun me around before putting me back down and gave me a ruffle on the head with his warm hand, turning my hair into a messy nest.\n\n\n “Oh no, Myne, your hair is so messy now,” Tuuli gave me a big charming grin.\n\n\n She pulled out my hair stick and used her fingers to comb my hair. The relaxing feel of having Tuuli sift through my hair made me clench onto the hair stick.\n\n\n “Hold on, I’ll go get changed first,” my voice rang out with bliss as I ran back up to the second floor. Delia helped me get dressed. I quickly took off my blue roobs, along with the frilly and puffy shirt that young rich girls would wear. I picked up the Gilberta Company uniform for apprentices and stretched my arms through its sleeves. It had been a while since I last wore this and it felt a little small, but I was probably just mistaken.\n\n\n During the winter, I was holed up in my chambers and could only step out if I had a thick coat on, but today the weather was much warmer and I didn’t need on anymore.\n\n\n “…Excuse me, Sister Myne, but are families really that amazing?”\n\n\n Delia had her head tilted to the side as she buttoned up my shirt, she looked very perplexed.\n\n\n “No matter how much we do our best to attend to you, you always look forward to leaving the temple. Does your family matter that much to you?”\n\n\n “My time here was quite enjoyable, you all worked hard for me. But no matter what I still miss my family and would do anything to be with them.”\n\n\n I knew Delia and everyone else was doing their best as my attendants, but I could not forget about my family. I wanted to be with them.\n\n\n “I’m sorry, Delia.”\n\n\n “Please don’t apologise, Sister Myne. I… I just can’t understand. What does a family even mean?” Delia raised her question with pure curiosity rather than anger for me leaving them behind.\n\n\n Delia grew up in the orphanage with scarce memories of her family. She also avoided the other orphans she knew from the orphanage so she had never experienced anything remotely close to a family.\n\n\n “Well, what family means differs for everyone, I suppose. For me, family is home.”\n\n\n “Home?”\n\n\n “That’s right. My family is the place where I feel the most relaxed.”\n\n\n Delia responded to my answer by darting a look of jealousy towards the stairs down.\n\n\n “…That sounds really nice to have.”\n\n\n I was finally dressed and quickly packed up all the things I planned to bring back home. Rosina was surprised how unpoised I was and reminded me to move with grace.\n\n\n “Your haspiel playing has greatly improved over the winter, and you are better able to move with more elegance. However you easily succumb to your emotions and forget about your surroundings. Please remember everything you have learned, even if you are back home.”\n\n\n Rosina was turning into another High Priest, she was constantly reminding me things I needed to commit to when I returned home. She lectured me so much that frankly, I was about to ask her to jot it down for me. I doubt I could even remember half of whatever she said. And I felt that she was getting a little paranoid, we were still going to meet again soon.\n\n\n “Rosina, I will only be gone for a day. I don’t suppose all of these is necessary?”\n\n\n “Ah… that’s right, you will be back tomorrow.”\n\n\n Rosina gasped and used her hand to cover her mouth. This seemed to have completely slipped her mind. After calming her nerves, she gave me a soft but sad smile.\n\n\n “I was thinking that this would be the last time we will get to meet. Perhaps I was acting this way because I never got to see Sister Christine again after she returned home.”\n\n\n Rosina looked so melancholic that a statue of her could be enacted in the centre of a church right now. It appeared that her last master leaving had a deeper impact on her that I had initially imagined.\n\n\n “Rosina, I will be back in a blink of an eye.”\n\n\n “Yes, we look forward to your return.”\n\n\n I wasn’t planning to bring back a lot of things. I didn’t need any extravagant clothes or shoes, and my family already had their own needs covered. I was only going to bring back my woven basket.\n\n\n I made my way down the stairs with my basket in hand. Delia and Rosina trailed after me as they planned to see my off at the entrance to my chambers.\n\n\n “Dad, Tuuli, we can go now.”\n\n\n I saw that all my attendants were waiting in the hall. Gil looked as though he had rushed back here from the workshop while Fran was dressed differently like he was planning to accompany me back home too.\n\n\n “Alright, let’s go. Everyone, I can’t thank you enough for looking after Myne over the winter,” Dad thanked my attendants.\n\n\n “You don’t have to thank us, sir. As her attendants, it is given for us to do so,” Gil returned Dad a large grin.\n\n\n Hearing Gil made me smile, he sounded both polite and casual. After that I looked back towards everyone.\n\n\n “Alright then, please look after my chambers while I am gone, everyone.”\n\n\n My attendants knelt down and placed their arms across their chest.\n\n\n “We pray for your safe return.”\n\n\n Damuel would be following us back as he was acting as my bodyguard, but since this would be his first time, Fran tagged along to teach him the way there. We rendezvoused with Lutz at the workshop and made our way back together.\n\n\n When I finally stepped out of the temple, the first sight that came into view was the stone pavement that was now free of snow. The very sight of this filled me with nostalgia. It had been a while since I last came to the city on foot, and this time I was holding hands with Lutz and Tuuli too. Holding hands was not allowed in the temple. Their hands were so snug that it warmed me up.\n\n\n Dad walked behind us with Damuel and Fran, and they were talking about security affairs and my safety.\n\n\n “Haven’t got to walk this slow in a while, Myne.” Lutz chuntered with sarcasm.\n\n\n “Hey Myne. Uhm… Did you get slower or something over the winter?” Tuuli asked.\n\n\n “Huh, what?! I’ve gotten slwoer?!”\n\n\n Fran and Damuel never rushed me in the temple, and if we needed to get somewhere quick they would just carry me. Perhaps it was because of this that I had slackened and went back to a slower speed that I better preferred.\n\n\n “Wait, so how fast did I walk before? Like this?”\n\n\n I was moving my legs as fast as I could, but this just made Lutz laugh and shake his head.\n\n\n “It’s fine, Myne. You don’t have to be so harsh on yourself. Let’s just take it easy and enjoy your walk back home, hm?”\n\n\n I dragged my feet and we soon came across the Gilberta Company. Seeing it reminded me of whatever the High Priest said about delaying printing.\n\n\n “We might have to see Benno tomorrow…”\n\n\n “Did something happen?”\n\n\n “The High Priest said that printing will have to be delayed. It’s probably best for me to inform Benno about it,” I gave a deep sigh.\n\n\n Tuuli’s eyes widened in surprise.\n\n\n “Wait, what? Why, though? Weren’t you really looking forward to start printing?”\n\n\n “It’s because it involves nobles.”\n\n\n “…Oh. That sucks.”\n\n\n Tuuli gave me a pat on my head, and I closed my eyes to relish that feeling.\n\n\n “It’s not like I can’t ever print. He told me to wait for two years so I’m still ok.”\n\n\n I was content with my decision. A printing press wasn’t going to pat my head or comfort me like this whenever I was feeling down.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n “Alright then, I’ll be back here tomorrow at the second bell to take you back to the temple. Do your best to stay home,” Damuel gave me a very stern reminder when we arrived at the town square. Looks like I would not be leaving the house anytime soon without a bodyguard.\n\n\n “Yes, I’ll be careful, Sir Damuel, Fran. It must be quite troublesome to have walked this far and back, but thank you for doing this.”\n\n\n “No worries. Please have fun with your family tonight. I look forward to seeing you again tomorrow,” Fran said his goodbyes and placed his arms across his chest.\n\n\n “Thank you so much Fran and Sir Damuel, we will see you tomorrow.”\n\n\n Fran and Damuel started to make their way back to the temple. I said my goodbyes to Lutz and proceeded to climb the stairs up to our home that was the fifth floor. But it didn’t long for me to start panting.\n\n\n “Come on, Myne, you can do this. We’re almost there.”\n\n\n It was nearly impossible for me to walk home on my own two feet without Dad and Tuuli cheering me on. This was evident how weak I had gotten over the winter. My body was crippling weak and I didn’t want to lose any more of the stamina I had worked hard to build up.\n\n\n “I’m home, Mom.”\n\n\n I missed seeing my house’s entrance, when I opened the door I was greeted by the delicious smell of food. Mum probably heard us outside because she was preparing the table. The aroma of Mum’s cooking sent a smile across my face.\n\n\n “Welcome home, Myne.”\n\n\n Mum had her hand under her belly for support and she was placing a plate on the table. She looked up and gave me a smile. Seeing her smile welled up so much joy and nostalgia in me that it washed away all the things that weighed down on me.\n\n\n “I haven’t been outside for so long. I’m hungry.”\n\n\n “You can put down your things first and help me with the table.”\n\n\n “Yes~~”\n\n\n I put my woven basket back to its usual spot and went to clean my hands. After that I helped to prepare the table with Tuuli. I was enjoying all of these because I hadn’t got to do things for myself in a while.\n\n\n “Hey Mum, is the baby coming soon?”\n\n\n I asked as I turned my gaze to her bulging abdomen. She gave it a gentle pat and smiled.\n\n\n “Anytime now. Maybe the baby was waiting for you, Myne.”\n\n\n If that was truly so, I would be beyond ecstatic. I gently stroked Mum’s belly and cheered, “Big sister has returned.”\n\n\n All of a sudden, I felt a kick, almost as though the baby had heard me.\n\n\n “Wow! I felt the baby kick! It responded to me!” I exclaimed in surprise which sent my whole family bending over in laughter.\n\n\n I gobbled up everything Mum cooked, played with Tuuli in the bath, and squeezed into the tiny bed that I would crash into Tuuli if I tried to flip over. I ended the day by tucking into the bed with my family.\n\n\n The next morning, Mom started groaning from labour pains."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n It was daybreak when Dad heard Mum groaning from the labour pains and this made him jump out of bed.\n\n\n ‘Tuuli, Myne! Your mum is going into labour. I need to get the midwife! Quickly get dressed and help out with the rest!” Dad instructed us as he quickly dressed himself and left the house in a flurry.\n\n\n Everyone knew what to do except for me. While I was sent in a clueless daze, Tuuli had already got dressed and ran out the door.\n\n\n “I’m going to call Karla! Myne, stay here and look after Mum!”\n\n\n “I will!”\n\n\n I nodded back out of reflex but frankly, I wasn’t sure what I needed to do for Mum. My mind was filled with so much panic that I stood there frozen.\n\n\n “Uhh, uuuuhmm…”\n\n\n “Myne, could you, get me some water?” Mum asked me in a broken bated breath.\n\n\n I ran to the kitchen to pour her a cup of water from the jug and ran back to her. Mum gave me a gentle smile in thanks and took a sip of water. Sweat was beading on her forehead, it was when I left the room to grab a cloth did something important pop into my mind.\n\n\n …Hygiene! Sanitation! It’s important to keep clean!\n\n\n Our place was much cleaner than the average household here. Mum and Tuuli believed that I was so obsessed with cleanliness that they would clean the house daily. Furthermore, everyone now made washing hands a habit. But I did not expect the midwife and the other mothers helping out to do the same.\n\n\n “W-w-what am I going to do?!”\n\n\n I wanted them to at least clean their hands with some alcohol, but there was no way we had any alcohol for disinfecting at home.\n\n\n “Maybe I could use some alcohol instead… Uhm… uhmmm…”\n\n\n We didn’t have any alcohol home that was strong enough like vodka that could be used as a disinfectant. There was the wine that I used to make the ____, it was pretty strong but there was too many things in it that lowered its effectiveness. If I got to leave the temple earlier, I could have asked Benno to help me find some pure alcohol.\n\n\n “…But it’s better than nothing, I guess.”\n\n\n I would choose to day the impure alcohol over the dirt from outside on any day. I dug out the bottle of wine and a clean rag, ready to start cleaning.\n\n\n “I’m back. I’m heading out again to get some water.”\n\n\n Tuuli was heading out again with a bucket right after getting back home. Following her return was Karla and a few other mothers came back with buckets of water from the well. They poured out the contents into a tub and heated it with fire until it boiled.\n\n\n “Tuuli, everyone needs to clean their hands first. And the tools need to be sanitised with boiling water. Also—”\n\n\n I flooded Tuuli with my worries right before she left the house.\n\n\n “Yes, yes. We need to be clean. I know. I’ll remember it. Now just stay by Mum’s side, Myne.”\n\n\n Tuuli wasn’t taking my words to heart because I wasn’t going to be much help when Mum starts pushing later, so she just pushed me towards the bedroom and left. I moved closer to Mum and clutched onto her hand. She was panting heavily because of the labour pains, and she would grip my hand with every contraction that it felt like my hand was going to break.\n\n\n “Mum, when you’re going to start pushing, you can try breathing in and out like this, “hee hee hoo’. It’s called Lamaze breathing.”\n\n\n “La… what?”\n\n\n Though she was in so much pain, Mum still returned a bright smile.\n\n\n “Uh, it’s a way of breathing that can help ease the pain. Sorry, I’m not too sure about it.”\n\n\n Back when I was still Urano, the idea of getting pregnant or having to see someone give birth never came to mind before, hence I never found it necessary to read more about pregnancy. Though I knew about the Lamaze breathing, I had no idea what it was supposed to do or help with.\n\n\n “So it’s, hee-hee-hoo?”\n\n\n This made mum giggle and we started breathing together as the intervals between her contractions shortened. After a short while, the midwife and the other mothers who came by to help walked in. I was shocked by their arrival and ran to the foot of the bed with my arms spread wide in an attempt to stop them from approaching Mum.\n\n\n “Wait, you have to wash your hands first before you can come in!”\n\n\n “Oh yeah. I forgot how obsessed you are with cleanliness,” Karla was annoyed at my demands, but she did leave the room with the others to wash their hands. After that, I had them clean their hands again with the cloth soaked in wine.\n\n\n I hope this helps.\n\n\n “Alright, Myne, go to the kitchen. You’re not going to help much anyways. Also get that bonehead of a Gunther to stop panicking and take out the chair. He’s already had these many children but still can’t follow our instructions. Geez.”\n\n\n Seeing how dirty the cloth had gotten when I cleaned their hands made my face scrunch up. It meant that whatever I did to clean their hands was not enough. I wanted to try another method but I was pushed out of the room before I could do anything. Now that I had nothing better to do, I just told Dad what Karla told me and helped to get the chair.\n\n\n “Dad, why do we need this chair?” I was perplexed as to what this filthy looking chair was going to do. Dad proceeded to explain that Mum would sit here to give birth. I finally understood that this was supposed to be a delivery table, and I was stumped. Without any second thought, my arm reached for the cloth and alcohol.\n\n\n “…I need to clean this.”\n\n\n “Hey, wait, Myne! What on earth are you doing with my wine?!”\n\n\n “Mum has to sit on this, doesn’t she? I need to clean it.”\n\n\n I didn’t bother about Dad’s complaints and quickly wiped down the chair with the cloth and alcohol. I continued on until one of the mums came back out to retrieve it. She gave a hearty chuckle when she saw this.\n\n\n “So you need to clean this too? *sigh* you’re such a clean freak. Gunther, we don’t need any more help. Why don’t you make your way down?”\n\n\n Men were not allowed to witness the birthing process. Dad has already did everything that the fathers needed to do so he left the house.\n\n\n “I’m going to stay here.”\n\n\n “No, you’ll go down too, Myne. You’ll just keep bothering us with your pleas to keep clean.”\n\n\n “But I’m not joking around, it’s really important!”\n\n\n “Yes, yes. You can go now.”\n\n\n Tuuli could still stay around and she was busy making trips in and out the room to help. On the other hand, I was chased out of the house. The door has been shut so I was locked out.\n\n\n “Mum…”\n\n\n I couldn’t believe that they were weirded out by me even though I just emphasized the most basic hygiene rules. Thinking about how high infant mortality was in my past world, my blood went cold. I wanted to thoroughly wipe down everyone inside the house for Mum’s and the baby’s safety, but I was practically helpless.\n\n\n The labour pains started right on daybreak, but now the sun was almost entirely up in the sky that it almost lit up the entire square. When I left the building, I noticed that some of the townfolks were butchering some fresh birds.\n\n\n I noticed Dad pacing around the well and ran up to him.\n\n\n “Dad, what’s going on?” I gestured towards the other men.\n\n\n “…Since men aren’t allowed to watch the birth, we are in charge of the Naming Celebration.”\n\n\n “What’s that?”\n\n\n Since children weren’t allowed in the temple other than for their baptism, I wasn’t expecting there to be a religious celebration for newborns. Hearing the title of this ceremony, I assumed that it was just a local celebration.\n\n\n Dad continued to explain that the men were supposed to buy some birds, pluck their feathers and cook them for the Naming Celebration. It was just a minor ceremony, on these occasions the men would cook for themselves because their spouse couldn’t do so. Conversely, the women that helped out with delivering the baby would get some food in exchange. All in all, this was a celebration for the birth a newborn.\n\n\n “Why do the both of you keep walking around so frantically?” I heard someone’s voice. I spun around and saw Lutz in his apprentice uniform. He had a large grin and he looked like he was going to burst into laughter any moment now.\n\n\n “Lutz!”\n\n\n He looked up towards our house.\n\n\n “…Is Mdm Effa ok? It has started, right?”\n\n\n I have a nod.\n\n\n “Well then, I don’t suppose you will be going to the temple today. I’ll inform them later.”\n\n\n “Thanks, Lutz.”\n\n\n “Maybe I should take a day off today too. After all there’s a Naming Celebration, right? That baby is gonna be a big and healthy one. I need to get a good look at him,” Lutz had a smile across his face.\n\n\n Dad smiled back too and nodded fervently. We both said our goodbyes to Lutz and went back to pacing around the well.\n\n\n “Dad, do you not need to inform the others that you can’t make it to work today?”\n\n\n “Al helped me inform them when he went to get the birds. There’s no way I’m leaving here.”\n\n\n “I see.”\n\n\n After a few moments, Deid, who was Lut’z dad came over and roared at us.\n\n\n “Gunther, Myne! If you’re just going to walk around then at least help us out. You always do this, Gunther, you’re such a pain in the butt.”\n\n\n Deid wanted the both of us to help out with washing the veggies. We squatted at the well and washed them while talking. I didn’t know what was the mortality rate of births here, I needed to keep myself distracted or I would definitely stomp back into the house.\n\n\n “Dad, how long does it take for one to give birth?”\n\n\n “I only know that it took forever for you and Tuuli. I think I was out here for the entire day.”\n\n\n “Both of ya’ll were quite fast. Al’s one took much longer,” Deid responded with a shake of his head. He had walked over here to fetch a pail of water\n\n\n Only Dad felt that it was long, but everyone else said that Mum was one of those who was quick with the birthing process. Hearing that helped soothe some of my nerves, but Dad’s eyebrows were still knitted together, I felt really bad for him.\n\n\n “I don’t care if it’s quickor not. If waiting is all it takes for Effa and the baby to be safe this time, I can do it forever…\n\n\n “This time?”\n\n\n I blurted out my question. Maybe he had said that because he wanted a healthy baby and not a weak one like me.\n\n\n “We lost out first kid to a miscarriage. Our second was a boy, but he didn’t even make it past his first year. You and Tuuli are ok now, but our kid after you didn’t make it past winter. And the last one was a miscarriage too. I pray that the baby will live through this time.”\n\n\n Everything he said gave me a gripping sense of surrealism about infant mortality here. I did read books about the high death rates among infants centuries ago, but the reality never set in until now. I only came to realise its severity when Dad talked about my short-lived siblings. I was so scared that I went back to staring up at our house. Right now, right there, Mum was doing her best for the baby and herself.\n\n\n “Mum will be fine, right?”\n\n\n “…Myne, please say a prayer for her.”\n\n\n Without a second thought, I went into the praying pose and said the prayers will all my might.\n\n\n “O Goddess of Birth, Entolindage and the retainer of the Goddess of Water, please bless my mother with your divine protection.”\n\n\n Lutz had returned from the Gilberata Company and orphanage; he was carrying a large open-top basket behind him. He placed it down and took out what was inside.\n\n\n “Myne, Mister Benno wants to give you all some cloth. Your chambers and the workshop also know about this. Hugo prepared some of the meat that Brother Syl got from the other day.”\n\n\n “…The baby is not even out yet.”\n\n\n Even so, I was happy that everyone was so caring and generous.\n\n\n “I’ll save the smaller parts of the bird meat for Mum to have later. For the naming celebration, we can use up the rest of the bird meat and the deer meat. We’ll have them after she’s given birth and we can share it with the other ladies too. Lutz, take some too, after all you were the one who brought it here,” I said and took out some of the meat for Lutz.\n\n\n Dad was very pleased with whatever I said and nodded along. Just them, Tuuli came running out into the plaza and her hair was bouncing along with every step, she was smiling brightly.\n\n\n “Dad, Myne! Everything is good! The baby is a boy!”\n\n\n “Waaaaa~ Congrats!”\n\n\n Everyone around the plaza roared out with words of congratulations. And with that, we commenced the naming celebration and began feasting. The fathers from the neighbouring houses gulped down their booze and started grilling the meat on the grills they brought over.\n\n\n “Dad, Myne, you can go back in. Come one.”\n\n\n Naturally, the first ones to see the baby were the closest family members. Dad picked up the basket Lutz carried over and carried me into his arms. He skipped up the steps by two, speeding up the flights of stairs because he was so excited.\n\n\n Dad practically busted down the door, he gave his thanks to the women inside who had helped out and were cleaning the place now. They also gave their congrats and complimented that they baby looked very healthy.\n\n\n “Dad, keep the germs out of the bedroom!”\n\n\n I wasn’t going to let Dad into the bedroom like this. I dragged him aside, made him put down the basket and cleaned his hands. Though the other women were teasing me for being a clean freak again, I wasn’t going to listen to them. After that I cleaned my hands too.\n\n\n “Mum, we’re coming in, ok?”\n\n\n “Gunther, Myne, look it’s a boy.”\n\n\n “Thank you, Effa! I’m happy that you’re both safe!”\n\n\n Dad knelt by Mum’s side and took her hand into his, he left a trail of kisses from the back of her hand to her fingertips.\n\n\n The baby was sleeping soundly on Mum’s chest. He was so small and wrinkly all over, his skin was flushed red, but that was a sign that he was healthy. My heart welled up with so much joy when I got to see the baby get cleaned and wear the newborn clothes Tuuli had worked hard to make.\n\n\n “Well, have you decided on the baby’s name?”\n\n\n “You thought of one already? What’s his name?” Tuuli was between Mum and Dad. She was so excited and bouncing all over the place.\n\n\n They both nodded back in sync and exchanged looks before looking back at the baby and stroked his head.\n\n\n “His name will be ‘Camil’. How does it sound?” Mum looked at us to see our response.\n\n\n “Camil? Camil… hehehe.”\n\n\n Tuuli gave a little giggle and poked Camil’s cheek. Mum smiled when she saw this and turned to look back at me.\n\n\n “Myne, would you like to carry him? Tuuli had her turn just now.”\n\n\n I wanted to, but at the same time I was afraid that I would drop him.\n\n\n If I’m not wrong, newborns weighed roughly three kilograms. Am I strong enough to hold him?\n\n\n While I was caught up worrying about that, Mum’s expression sank.\n\n\n “Do you not want to?”\n\n\n “No, no, I want to. But… I don’t know how to properly hold a baby, and what if I drop him?” I told them my worries but Dad just gave a chuckle. Before I knew it, I was up in his arms. He was still laughing the whole time he moved to take off my shoes and plopped me onto the bed.\n\n\n “You can hold him on the bed, you can be at ease then.”\n\n\n I squeezed myself next to Mum and gently took Camil into my arms. He was so tiny and light that I didn’t have much trouble carrying him. I saw his face twitch and his eyelids slowly opened. He looked at me with a dazed look. He was so warm that it melted my heart.\n\n\n “Camil, Camil. I’m your big sister.”\n\n\n I whispered to Camil, and his face started to scrunch up. In the next moment, he burst out crying.\n\n\n “M-Mum. Crying, he’s… Camil’s crying… W-what should I do?”\n\n\n “It’s ok, sweetie. Babies cry all the time. Don’t worry about it.”\n\n\n She said that to comfort me, but it wasn’t doing much because I was still confused with what I needed to do. My eyes kept scanning around the room for help. I felt like crying from my helplessness until Dad, who was still smiling, finally stepped in and took Kamil into his arms. Kamil pushed out a few more whimpers before settling down. Dad did it all so easily. .\n\n\n “Ok, Camil is going out to meet everyone else.”\n\n\n “Wait, what? You’re going to take a newborn outside?”\n\n\n “Of course. Everyone needs to meet Camil, right?”\n\n\n It was unspeakable for a newborn baby to be exposed to the outside elements because it could prove fatal for it. There was no way I was letting it happen on my watch.\n\n\n “Dad, must you really insist on taking him outside?”\n\n\n “Yes, I am. What’s the matter?”\n\n\n “It’s dangerous for a newborn to go out. He might come into contact with all the bad germs or fall sick from the cold. It’s really bad for him!”\n\n\n I tried to explain everything as seriously as I could. Dad frowned and his gaze turned profoundly deep. I could tell he was considering my words, but in the end he shook his head.”\n\n\n “I know that you might be right, but we can’t just forget about traditions.”\n\n\n “If we really have to take him outside, could you do your best to keep him warm and stop anyone from touching him? Their hands could be very dirty. After that please try to bring him back in as fast as possible. Remember to also—”\n\n\n “You’re overreacting, Myne. Nothing will happen,” Tuuli brushed off my anxieties. But I wasn’t overreacting, newborns are really weak. They are very susceptible to anything, especially in a place like this. Thank goodness Dad was resolved to keep his baby safe as much as possible this time, so he snuggly wrapped Kamil in a thick cloth.\n\n\n “So I just have to be quick with this, right?”\n\n\n “Mhm. Try not to let anyone else touch him.”\n\n\n “You’re both too paranoid about everything,” Tuuli was getting quite annoyed with us, “Everyone else takes their babies out all the time.”\n\n\n What she said was not false, but it was better to be safe than sorry in a place like this. There was no harm with trying to be overprotective in this case.\n\n\n We all descended down the stairs to the ground floor; Dad was holding Kamil in his arms. We noticed that the neighbours had started the grilling party in the square (that is the naming celebration). Right now the ladies who helped with delivering the baby would receive their rewards and the baby would get to meet everyone here. This celebration was also a means to keep track of when the baby was born and when they needed to get baptized. There was no birth registry for commoners so everyone had to rely on their memories.\n\n\n “Everyone, take you for all your help this early in the morning. My son is safe and healthy. His name is Camil. Please bless him with your well wishes.”\n\n\n Dad loudly broadcasted this across the plaza and lifted Camil up above his head so that everyone could get a glimpse of him. After that he passed Camil over to Tuuli and told everyone he needed to go back in as he might be as weak as me. No one opposed this as they all knew that I was so weak that I could pass out at any time.\n\n\n “That would be horrible if Camil was as weak as Myne.”\n\n\n “She does fall sick once in a while, but she’s much better than before, isn’t she? She will surely grow up nice and healthy now that she’s been baptized.”\n\n\n Just as I was about to head in with Tuuli, I heard a couple of the neighbours talking about how they didn’t expect me to live past my baptism since I kept tethering close to death.\n\n\n To be honest, I wanted to eat inside because I was too worried about who had touched the food at the grill. And I was also warned against going outside with any protection. Given that I had spent quite some time outside waiting for the birth, it was best to head back as soon as possible.\n\n\n “Tuuli, what’s Mum going to eat?”\n\n\n “I’ll help take some food for her from the grill outside,” Tuuli responded back. She was probably looking forward to the party downstairs because she zoomed back down right after passing Camil to Mum.\n\n\n I lit the fireplace and heated up the leftover soup from yesterday. As I left the soup to boil, I walked over to the basket that Dad just ditched in the corner of the room. I fished out the bird meat from Hugo that he had stored in the pantry. After that I folded the cloth from Benno and stored it at the side.\n\n\n “Mum, are you hungry? I’m heating up the leftover soup. You need to eat plenty so that you can make lots of milk.”\n\n\n “You’re right, thank you for preparing it.”\n\n\n I poured the soup into two bowls. One for Mum to take in bed, and another for me. I dragged a chair next to the bed so that we could eat together.\n\n\n “Do you not want to join the others, Myne?”\n\n\n “Nah, afterall Sir Damuel said not to go outside without him.”\n\n\n “Is that so,” Mum’s voice had dipped an octave, she seemed troubled that I wasn’t close with our neighbours.\n\n\n I didn’t like this situation too, but if they understood the importance of hygiene and cleanliness they surely wouldn’t want to eat their food there too.\n\n\n “Oh, I almost forgot. Lutz helped bring over gifts. Benno got us a cloth and my attendants cut us a share of meat too. Do we have to prepare something to thank them back?” I asked Mum because I didn’t know how things worked here.\n\n\n Mum shook her head and said that gifts were only given when a child is born. I kind of found it pitiful because Benno was a single man and it was hard for those in the temple to get married.\n\n\n “Anyways, Myne, could you kindly tell them more about Camil? I hope that more people will remember when Camil was born.”\n\n\n “Sure, leave it up to me,” I puffed up my chest and nodded enthusiastically. I admired the sight of my little brother sleeping next to Mum. He looked so cute snuggled in that huge cloth. The corner of my eyes went up.\n\n\n “Camil is so cute.”\n\n\n “I know, right?”\n\n\n My time with Camil was limited. We would get separated even before he turns two, he might not even remember me at all. I wanted to at least make him all the picture books and toys he will ever need, so that he would get by fine without me. Maybe they would even help him remember his big sister.\n\n\n …Now that I can only make picture books for children, I’ll just go all out and make dozens of them for my adorable brother.\n\n\n Until he’s three months old, monotone picture books will do for Camil, but I would like to make some with colour before he’s six months old. But first, I would need to figure out how to make coloured ink and some new ideas for its contents.\n\n\n …Hold on. Doesn’t that mean I have lots to do? Maybe I’ll get much busier than expected for the next two years?\n\n\n Now that I wanted to make as many picture books as I could for Camil, I might not have the time to think about making text-only books. It’s ok if I couldn’t use the printing press, I’ll just work on improving the stencils.\n\n\n …I don’t have that much time left. I need to work harder. Camil, your big sister is going to do her best!"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Delia had filled a bucket full of water from the well and was in the midst of carrying it up to the second floor when Gil came bursting in. He didn’t usually return from the workshop this early. The only times he returned before Myne was when he needed to make a report from Lutz. Delia knew that he was back this time because Myne fell sick again.\n\n\n Really, Sister Myne? What did you do this time?! You finally returned home and you’re sick again!\n\n\n Delia continued lamenting how weak her mistress was on the inside while asking Gil if Sister Myne would not come to the temple that day. He jolted at her question and looked upstairs to where Delia was.\n\n\n “Well… she’s not going to be back for the next few days. Oh, Fran! Wait…”\n\n\n Gil was curt with his response and ran away to talk to Fran.\n\n\n “Slow down, Gil. Please remember to speak properly when reporting matters to others.”\n\n\n Delia continued climbing up with the bucket in tow, she was used to hearing Fran nag at Gil about the same things.\n\n\n She had finally reached the top and saw that Rosina was done with the work tasked by Fran and was busy tuning her harspiel now. She looked so pretty when she focused on tuning the instrument (she was used to moving with grace). Her nails were always short so that she could tune her instrument, and her hands were soft and pale because she didn’t have to do any laborious jobs. Her job responsibility only consisted of music tutoring and paperwork, she didn’t have to work physically like carrying around buckets of water.\n\n\n We are both such different people so it’s a given that we wouldn’t have the same job. It’s because of this that I need to work harder to pick up more skills, that way I will be favoured by the High Priest.\n\n\n Delia was even more resolved on this whenever she saw the glaring difference between herself and the other gray shrine maidens. She barely managed to get out of that horrible orphanage as kids around her dropped dead every time. She was going to live the rest of her life comfortably by earning the temple’s most powerful figure’s love, that is the High Bishop’s. With that goal in mind, she was going to watch Rosina to learn how to become more graceful and refined-like.\n\n\n I mean, Jenni managed to catch the High Priest’s attention and she used to serve Sister Christine.\n\n\n Delia thought this to herself as she brought a pail to the washroom. She proceeded to lift and pour the contents of the bucket she carried in previously into the pail. Water was absolutely necessary on the second floor as it was needed to clean the place and to clear their excrements. Delia found the job of carrying the bucket from the well to this place the most tedious one.\n\n\n “Hm, maybe we only need one more bucket?”\n\n\n They didn’t need that much water when Myne wasn’t around. After checking that there was sufficient water in the pail, she left the washroom with the empty bucket in tow. Right then she witnessed Fran asking Rosina to find a cloth of a certain length.\n\n\n “Would you like me to help out, Fran?”\n\n\n “Pardon me if I am wrong, but I take it that you are not done with transporting the water, Delia. Please continue with that first,” Fran smiled warmly.\n\n\n Delia was aware that Fran knew that she could find the cloth the quickest, yet he approached Rosina to do the task instead. She concluded that they were trying to hide something that needed to be hidden from the High Bishop.\n\n\n What’s going on? Delia was curious about it but she didn’t try to dig any further. She knew that Fran wasn’t going to let the cats out of the bag no matter what she did. Her best plan was to feign indifference so that Fran would not be suspicious of her, she could ask Rosina more details later.\n\n\n “Why do we need the cloth though, Fran?” Rosina probed.\n\n\n “To pack meat. The cloth doesn’t need to be a fine one.” Fran answered back.\n\n\n To pack meat?\n\n\n The empty bucket kept swaying as Delia made her descent down the stairs. She strained her ears to eavesdrop on their conversation, but it was too soft to hear and Gil’s (who was in the kitchen) voice now overlapped it.\n\n\n Strange. She thought that Gil would return to the workshop after passing the message.\n\n\n “We would want to make it seem like Sister Myne is very thankful to the people in the lower city who have helped her,” Gil said.\n\n\n “No problem, so how much should I pack?” Hugo asked.\n\n\n “Uhm… I don’t know about that. I’m sure you can figure that out, Hugo. Anyways, Fran said that it needs to be an amount that won’t raise suspicion amongst those in the lower city…”\n\n\n “Oh, so it needs to be an inconspicuous amount,” Ella interrupted them. She was so loud that her voice reverberated from the kitchen and out through the common corridor.\n\n\n “Well, since it’s supposed to be a celebration we can give them lots of deer meat and use the guise that it’s a gift from the workshop.”\n\n\n What celebration are they talking about?\n\n\n The only events a gray shrine maiden would ever celebrate was their baptism and their coming of age ceremony. But Myne wasn’t going to celebrate any of them right now.\n\n\n So something happened in the lower city. Something that calls for a celebration. Delia kept wondering about the possible events as she made her way out.\n\n\n When Delia returned to the chambers, the dust had settled. Gil was gone with the meat for the celebration. Fran was back to work with his monotonous face and Rosina was helping him because she didn’t need to tutor Myne today. The kitchen door was also closed now.\n\n\n On days when Myne wasn’t in the temple, Delia would be free for the day. She didn’t need to set out the table during meals, or steep the tea between meals. She didn’t have to help with the baths, or help with changing attires. Other than that, everyone would settle their own dishes and laundry with little issue.\n\n\n However, Fran was always busy regardless if Myne was present or not. Rosina supported him by helping out with the paperwork, but she occasionally took breaks to play the harspiel. As of late, Gil was always in the workshop and orphanage. The workshop needed to continue operations even if Lutz was not around because he had other matters to tend to. Gil helped out because he wanted to learn and expand his skillset.\n\n\n Delia was different though. She barely had any work to do. That was because she was planted her by the High Bishop so they didn’t want her finding out about important matters related to Myne.\n\n\n Delia was disappointed that she was left out, even so she was still proud to be a part of the the High Bishop’s association.\n\n\n “I will be going to the High Priest’s” Fran said this slightly after the third bell. He always left to help the High Priest even when Myne was absent.\n\n\n After finishing her task with the documents, Rosina picked up the harspiel.\n\n\n Delia was free until the fourth bell, so she took the chance to make her way down to the High Bishop’s chambers.\n\n\n “It’s me, Delia. I would like to make my report to the High Bishop,” she declared to the gray priest stationed at the chamber’s doors. After a while, the door opened and Jenny was standing inside, grinning.\n\n\n “Apologies, Delia. The High Bishop has left for the neighbouring lands.”\n\n\n “Hasn’t the High Bishop handed the chalices over to the Noble’s District? Why is he leaving the city even though Spring Prayer is over?”\n\n\n Delia was perplexed because it didn’t match up to the High Bishop’s schedule she had committed to memory when she was working to become his apprentice here.\n\n\n Jenny said that she was unclear of the reason too, she only knew that there was an invitation from one of the southern lands. Apparently one of the nobles that owned the land there wanted a discussion with the High Bishop.\n\n\n “Hence, I will be the one to receive your report,” Jenny continued.\n\n\n Delia made her report that there had been a celebration of sorts involving Myne in the lower city, and that they prepared some meat as a gift.\n\n\n Jenny scribbled down what she said onto a board before looking back at Delia with a smile.\n\n\n “Delia, you look more graceful and refined than you were.”\n\n\n Myne and Rosina always praised Delia for her hardworking spirit, but hearing it from Jenny was much more pleasing to the ear. That was because Delia looked up to Jenny who was her ultimate goal, that is being favoured by the High Priest.\n\n\n “I want to be more like Rosina so that I can become the High Bishop’s concubine.”\n\n\n “Of course, that’s an amazing dream. It’s been so long… I wonder if Rosina is doing well now.”\n\n\n Delia shifted the conversation to talk about Rosina and what she did as Myne’s attendant. She would occasionally talk about Wilma who was staying in the orphanage too. Jenny listened on with a very pleased expression.\n\n\n “Do take better care of your appearance, Delia. There might be a noble visiting soon.”\n\n\n “Do you suppose the High Bishop will let me meet them? Oh no… Fran’s not going to let come though. He always does this.”\n\n\n Delia’s pale blue eyes filled with glitter when she heard this piece of news, but it dissipated when she recalled her situation. Jenny gave her an amicable smile back.\n\n\n “I believe that this noble likes children. Don’t worry about it. I’m sure the High Bishop will summon you over, Delia.”\n\n\n If Delia caught the attention of this noble, there’s a possibility she could become a noble’s concubine and not that of the High Bishop. If she was that lucky, she could even leave the temple.\n\n\n Though Delia knew that the chances of this happening was nearly impossible, she was still excited about it. She left the High Bishop’s room in high spirits, fantasizing about how amazing her life was going to be, so much so that she didn’t hear Jenny mutter under her breath.\n\n\n “It would seem like the noble is looking for a child with the Devouring.”"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The fourth bell rang and it was lunchtime. I made sure that the apprentice was back in her chambers before making my way to Lord Ferdinand’s room. Whenever I was in the temple he would send me an invitation to lunch with him. Of course I was so nervous when I first ate with him that the food had turned bland. Now that a whole season has passed, I was more comfortable dining with him, and frankly I began to anticipate our meals together.\n\n\n Well, that is because he gets to eat food that a lower-class nobility like me only gets to on rare ocassions.\n\n\n “Lord Ferdinand, thank you for your invite.”\n\n\n I was led into the chambers by a gray priest attendant. Our meal was being laid out on the table and I saw that Lord Feridnand was still busy with work. He only looked at me to acknowledge my presence.\n\n\n The first time I had been here, I panicked when I saw this because I thought I had intruded during an important time, but now I knew that this was just the norm here. While making sure I wasn’t going to get in the way of the attendants prepping our meal, I made my way towards Lord Ferdinand.\n\n\n “Damuel, what’s with that board?” Lord Ferdinand asked.\n\n\n “It has a couple of questions from the apprentice addressed to you. She would like you to answer them if possible.”\n\n\n Lord Ferdinand reached out and took the board. He scanned through the questions and shook his head. I heard him mutter under his breath with a twinge of annoyance, “So she’s reading an old bible this time…” After that he began scribbling down the answers.\n\n\n The apprentice wanted to ask him some words and things she didn’t understand from the books she was reading. She just picked up a bible that was written in an archaic language that even I, a graduate of the Royal Academy, could not decipher.\n\n\n The situation was completely bizarre because who would ever imagine a girl who just got baptized to be interested in such a book. It was surprising to see the apprentice flip through the bible with a cheerful grin, so engrossed in trying to learn this archaic language by comparing it with a more modern copy of it.\n\n\n “She said that she enjoyed analysing it alongside a more modern edition, and that she was thankful to even have the opportunity to read words.” I said.\n\n\n “Well touching a book is enough to please her.”\n\n\n “You couldn’t be more right. I was utterly stupefied on my first day at the temple and saw how much of a bookworm she was.”\n\n\n On my first day as her bodyguard, the first thing she had done was run to the hall of books. The room was freezing cold because there wasn’t a fireplace but she stayed in there for hours. She was already fragile enough that a gust of wind could knock her out but she sat inside reading for hours, while other people wouldn’t even want to set foot in here.\n\n\n Fran and I were at a loss, so we could only ask Lord Ferdinand to allow her to bring the books back to her chambers so that she could read it near the fireplace. If we didn’t do anything, the apprentice would just get lost in her book for hours in that glacial room. Plus, I would be stuck with her for the entire time. Now that was a risky situation.\n\n\n “She even reads when she’s sick in bed. Even when she needs to rest to recover, she insists that she needs books. She keeps begging until Fran gives in and hands her one.”\n\n\n “I’m not surprised by that bonehead anymore,” Lord Ferdinand gave a nonchalant reply as he continued writing his response to the queries about this language so ancient that even the Royal Academy did not cover it in classes.\n\n\n I was so impressed by Lord Ferdinand, everything my elder brother had said about him being a phenomenon, I was bearing witness to it right now. I was motivated to study more about the old languages because I couldn’t answer any of the questions from the apprentice.\n\n\n It’s kind of embarrassing that a noble can’t answer a commoner apprentice maiden’s questions. I might be a lower-class noble, but still…\n\n\n My life is feeling kind of surreal now. I was supposed to serve my punishment in the temple but now I’m studying more than I did at the Royal Academy.\n\n\n “High Priest, Lord Damuel. The food is ready,” an attendant addressed us, which meant that I had to leave his desk now.\n\n\n The whole table was adorned with a colourful myriad of appetisers, it was on a completely different scale than the food back in the knight quarters and at home.\n\n\n I took my seat with a grumbling tummy. I tried to hunker it down, I would be embarrassed if Lord Ferdinand (someone who I greatly looked up to) heard it.\n\n\n The meal was tauzschnitz today, this was a stewed-bird dish. Just from its looks, I could tell that it was cooked with lots of care and attention, the meat looked so soft that its juices would seep out the moment you put it into your mouth.\n\n\n “What went on yesterday?” Lord Ferdiand raised a question as he started on his meal.\n\n\n One of my job’s responsibilities was to give a daily report of what the apprentice did between our daily lunch. Though Fran was also giving his reports about the apprentice too, Lord Ferdinand wanted information from various sources. I was thankful for this responsibility of mine because it felt too awkward to eat with Lord Ferdinnand in silence.\n\n\n I gave my report, “Tuuli and a couple of people from the Gilberta Company came over yesterday afternoon. They were making plans on how to run the workshop without Myne over the Spring Prayer .”\n\n\n I said all this while cutting a portion of the softly stewed fargel meat and dipped it into the cream before putting it into my mouth. A burst of flavours came rushing in, the buttery cream washed over my tastebuds and the tender meat crumbled in my mouth.\n\n\n Ha… There’s nothing as delicious as some nice warm creamy fargel meat.\n\n\n It felt like springtime again for me, but this also meant that I couldn’t eat the parue cakes I had at the orphanage. These were commoner sweets that didn’t exist in the Noble’s District, but their taste was packed full with flavours. The apprentice said that this was the highlight of every winter. I guessed that she didn’t realise that I wouldn’t be her bodyguard anymore by next winter.\n\n\n And I don’t think it would be a good idea for me to harvest some parue with commoners. This sucks.\n\n\n I was trying to recall the taste of that delicious parue cake when Lord Ferdinand said, “Oh yes”. He must have recalled that he wanted to ask something.\n\n\n “I keep hearing about this person ‘Tuuli’, but who is she exactly and what does she does here? I don’t suppose she has as many things to do like the Gilberta Company.”\n\n\n Tuuli always made a frequent appearance in the reports, she always came with the Gilberta Company but would head off to the orphanage immediately. I only came to realise that I failed to give details on her because I believed that the Gilberta Company would do so.\n\n\n Tuuli was the apprentice’s older sister and was a thorough-bred commoner. They didn’t really resemble each other despite being siblings. I could tell that they were close but it was because they spoke and acted so differently that I struggled to believe that they were kin.\n\n\n “Tuuli helps tutor the orphans sewing and cooking in exchange for lessons on math and reading in the orphanage school. Now that spring has begun again, she has to get back to work so she only visits on alternate days. It’s quite important for the the apprentice to see her family members so that she will remain composed.”\n\n\n “Great. That sounds like splendid news.”\n\n\n Things had gotten out of hand during the severe snowstorms last winter. The weather was so bad that the apprentice’s family couldn’t make the trip down. She had gotten so anxious that she needed to stay by Lord Ferdinand’s side all the time, she resembled a small duckling following its parent.\n\n\n On the worst days, Lord Ferdinand had to take the apprentice to his studio. He was quite uncomfortable doing so but it was the last resort to cool her nerves.\n\n\n The studio was also known as Lord Ferdinand’s hidden room. Nobles saw their hidden room as their most secretive and elusive place. It was the only place they could seek solace and comfort in when needed, so they usually wouldn’t take too kindly to someone entering it. Though noble children would put their parents’ mana in the room’s roster so they could enter too, they would rewrite the barrier so that only they themselves could enter. That was why I was so shocked when Lord Ferdinand allowed someone he was not close to enter his hidden room.\n\n\n Then again, I could understand why he did so, the apprentice was not a noble so she could not have a hidden room of her own. As such, she had no place to relieve her stress without worry. Furthermore, being the future daughter of a noble demands her to maintain a calm and collected expression at all times.\n\n\n “Damuel, now that you have spent a season with Myne, how do you feel about her being Karstedt’s adopted daughter?” Lord Ferdinand raised a question.\n\n\n I paused with the knife in hand and recalled what happened with the apprentice last winter.\n\n\n “…She always looks so happy whenever she’s with her family and the Gilberta Company, it pains me to see how dejected she looks whenever they leave. Having to see such a young girl be separated from her family is a sorrowful sight to bear. Nevertheless, for her safety, it is crucial that she gets adopted. With the amount of mana she possess, her knowledge to start such a profitable workshop and her money sense, along with her crippling health, she will not survive as a commoner.”\n\n\n ‘“So we share the same sentiments,” Lord Ferdinand’s voice dipped a tone as he took a bit of his food.\n\n\n “I got the chance to see her run the orphanage and workshop in person, and I can say for sure that the apprentice is a peculiar person. It’s not an issue of whether she is a noble or a commoner, she’s entirely different from everyone.\n\n\n The hierarchy between nobles and commoners was established based on the amount of mana they possessed or not, as such they acted very differently from each other. Yet the apprentice was unlike any noble or commoner. It had nothing to do with the amount of mana she possessed, the things she did and the way she thinks was out of this world. The stark contrast between the apprentice and the other commoners was even more distinct when she interacted with her family or the Gilberta Company.\n\n\n “The most shocking thing was when she said that she started the workshop in the orphanage for pure satisfaction. I would never come to imagine that a commoner would choose to do something for pleasure, and not survival. Furthermore, she’s earning so much money that my mind cannot wrap around it.”\n\n\n During the times I was in her chambers, I would often hear her discussions with the Gilberta Company and see her working on the reports with Fran and Gil to calculate the workshop’s revenue. It has barely been a year since she got baptized but she is earning more than a laynoble’s annual salary, using myself as the comparison.\n\n\n “No matter which angle you see her from, the apprentice is an odd one, indeed. But I firmly believe that she needs Lord Karstedt’s protection if she wants a smooth-sailing life.” I finished my conjecture.\n\n\n There was nothing better than having the commander of the Knight Order protection, adding on to the fact that he is a relative of the archduke too. Being with a noble like Lord Karstedy was much better than a violent and horrible mid-noble like Shikza. And the best thing would be that if she became the daughter of an archnoble and entered the noble society, she could improve my situation by showing her favour to me again. My life would be back to how it was before I screwed up that time. For now, I wanted to continue serving the apprentice as it would help me in my future endeavours.\n\n\n “…To think that you would speak of Myne so fondly, you must be quite used to life in the temple and serving her now. You look much different than last time,” Lord Ferdinand commented.\n\n\n I gave a wistful smile and continued to eat my food. Feeling the meat crumble apart in my mouth truly resembled how my life was like last autumn, my life was literally crumbling apart. My whole life had turned around during the mission to kill the trombe.\n\n\n “I was looking forward to my first mission to exterminate the trombe because I couldn’t participate in them before my coming of age. I know I am just a low-ranking knight, but I always did my best to memorise the prayers on Darkness for weapons.”\n\n\n “I do have some vague memories about the knights getting overjoyed at being able to use weapons with Darkness for the first time,” Lord Ferdinand gave a nostalgic smile.\n\n\n Apparently he was excited for his first official mission as a knight too. I didn’t know why, but hearing that made me kind of happy.\n\n\n “I understand why Lord Karstedt chose me to watch over the apprentice then. I had just graduated as an apprentice knight and had no prior experience with trombe extermination. Furthermore, I didn’t possess much mana. Even so, I wished that he didn’t select Shikza as my partner.”\n\n\n Shikza was a mid-noble that left the temple after the last civil political restructuring. He used to be a priest with little mana, so the noble society looked down on him. The only thing that comforted him was his status that allowed him to trample on those beneath him in status, that is the lower-ranking nobles. No matter how much I hated it and was vexed by it, there was no way I could go against a midnoble.\n\n\n “Shikza believed that his status allowed him to freely harm the apprentice with no consequences. Though the only punishment I received was a demotion and not an execution, my life had turned for the worst. I was sent into debt and had to seek out my older brother to pay for my portion of the apprentice’s clothes. My engagement with my ex-fiancee was dissolved because I had been demoted to an apprentice knight and my new job was in a temple that required me to guard a commoner apprentice shrine maiden. The temple was seen as a dead-end for those without mana, even the other knights in the Order would crackle over it.\n\n\n A single event had pushed me over the cliff in an instant. I had earned everyone’s gaze of sympathy, they knew I was in this position because of Shikza, but that didn’t make me feel any better. My reputation as a knight was stained now that I would forever be remembered as the knight who failed his mission and was exiled to the temple.\n\n\n I finished recounting how I had suffered as interesting as possible. After that, Lord Ferdinand placed down his utensils and his face hardened.\n\n\n “I feel that you were truly unfortunate and that you did not deserve to be a victim of this horrible event. But at the same time, I cannot entirely agree with the notion that you were punished because of Shikza’s foolishness. You have made mistakes too and it appears that you have not realised them yet.”\n\n\n …I made a mistake?\n\n\n I only thought that I was just unlucky to have been dragged into someone else’s problems. Everyone around me told me I was just unlucky but no one said I had messed up too.\n\n\n I was utterly bamboozled by this, “Someone like me can’t do anything but obey orders from those above me in status. I couldn’t do anything, right?”\n\n\n Lord Ferdinand raised his eyebrow.\n\n\n “Damuel, you should have used rott the moment you realized that Shikza was getting out of hand.”\n\n\n “Rott” was a magic used to signal for help. It was conjured by the schtappe and produced a crimson light. Lord Ferdinand explained that I should have used rott to call for backup from the other knights involved in the fight. But frankly, when it came down to choosing between protecting a commoner shrine maiden and eliminating a dangerous trombe, the altter seemed more important.\n\n\n “…To think of using rott, that did not come to my mind at all then.”\n\n\n “If you were guarding an archnoble or an archduke’s daughter from another duchy, you would have done so, right?”\n\n\n He made a point. If I was guarding the daughter of an archnoble, there was no doubt that I would have done everything to stop Shikza’s attack. If I was not strong enough to subdue him, I would have resorted to using rott. So I had subconsciously been undermining the apprentice like Shikza because she was a commoner. My mind went into shock.\n\n\n “You must always put the subject of your protection before yourself. When you find yourself in a situation where you cannot do so, you should have used rott. Seek the aid of nobles of a higher status when you find yourself oppressed by a tyrannic midnoble. But you did not do any of them. You just accepted the situation in cowardice rather than fulfill your duties, and now you complain that you have suffered before of your misfortune. That is why you are at fault too.”\n\n\n Though Lord Ferdinand looked quite serious about it, his tone was quite soft. He was trying to reassure me that he would have come if I had asked for help.\n\n\n What he said stupefied me. This was the first time an archnoble had offered me his help.\n\n\n “…The upcoming Spring Prayer will greatly require your support. There has been a disturbing amount of rumours circulating around as or late. Cowardice and arrogance will not be tolerated for this mission.”\n\n\n “Yes, sir! I promise that I will protect the apprentice this time.”\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n After our lunch, I was planning to return to the orphanage director’s chambers when I was halted by Lord Ferdinand.\n\n\n “Hold on. You mentioned that you had to resort to borrowing money from your older brother. Is that going alright?”\n\n\n Nope, it’s rather bad.\n\n\n I had been demoted to an apprentice so my salary was obviously that of an apprentice’s now. Furthermore, most of my savings had gone to my soon-to-be-wife’s expenses back when I was still engaged.\n\n\n I wanted to ask if I could receive some money back, but my older brother dissuaded me from doing so now that the engagement has been dissolved. And even if they returned it back, it wouldn’t amount to much because it couldn’t settle my debt.\n\n\n “Frankly, my financial situation is worse than what it was back when I was still a Royal Academy student. Back then I had earned some money on the side from duplicating books and selling notes I made.”\n\n\n “Duplicating texts and selling notes…? Why would a knight like you do the work of a scholar?” Lord Ferdinand was perplexed. His surprise at this just made me feel ashamed.\n\n\n It was a common belief that knights earned money from hunting fey-wildlife, such as feyanimals, feyplants, etcetera, and sell the feystones and materials they extracted from them. It just that lower-ranking knights like me didn’t have the luxury of an enormous amount of mana like the archnobles, so it was tough for us to kill strong feyanimals. With that in mind, we could not get our hands on good materials, and the lower-ranking materials didn’t amount to much.\n\n\n “It’s much more profitable for me to sell some academic notes on knight courses than to take to hunting materials.”\n\n\n “Interesting… Seeing that you have derived quite some business from selling your notes, can I assume that you are quite dexterous with scholar work?” Lord Ferdinand asked.\n\n\n I gave him a nod. I helped with my brother’s paperwork whenever I returned home, and that helped me earn a fair share of money. I didn’t mind doing the work of a scholar. When discussing my future with my brother who worked as a scholar, I made the decision to become a knight so that we can widen our family’s connections and scope.\n\n\n Ferdinand’s eyes lit up in surprise before giving a calculative grin.\n\n\n “Damuel, will you be interested in working for me too after the Spring Prayer? I promise that I will give you a decent salary.”\n\n\n Ngh!\n\n\n My mind kept dwelling on the phrase “decent salary’, but I wasn’t going to fall for it. This might be a trap for me, furthermore, I wasn’t a scholar but a knight.\n\n\n “Thank you for your kind offer, Lord Ferdinand. But I have to turn it down because I am not a scholar.”\n\n\n “Do you not wish to earn money to the best of your abilities?”\n\n\n “I do, but I am after all, the bodyguard of the apprentice. I do not think it’s possible for me to do more work during my punishment…”\n\n\n I was conflicted over my pride as a knight and the harsh reality I was being forced to face right now. I was desperate for more money, this was the worst position to be in.\n\n\n Lord Ferdinand probably saw through my dilemma because he narrowed his eyes and spoke again.\n\n\n “Of course, you will only help out whenever Myne is in my room. I do not suppose it is presumptuous of me to say that she will be safe with me around.”\n\n\n That sent me into silence, I couldn’t argue against that when he pretty much told me upfront that he was stronger than me. Lord Ferdinand picked up a board and took this time to do write down some numbers.\n\n\n “I suppose you are aware of my busy work schedule. I would gladly accept any help that comes my way. Hm… How is this salary if you worked from the third to the fourth bell? If you do well, I would be glad to give you a pay raise.”\n\n\n He was offering me a salary similar to that of an adult knight from the lower-rankings, that is if I worked for a full month. The salary was more than I was given during my term as a bodyguard in the temple. An apprentice’s salary was truly pathetic, adding on a side job to my current one would be ideal.\n\n\n I gulped.\n\n\n “…I-I’ll be glad to accept your offer.”\n\n\n I needed to accept reality rather than try to protect my pride as a knight. Lord Ferdinand seemed pleased with my response and didn’t mock me at all.\n\n\n “Make good use of this opportunity. If you do not clear your debt, you might find it difficult to get engaged again when you return to the noble society, I suppose.”\n\n\n That felt like a stab in my heart, but I knew that Lord Ferdinand meant good intentions. Even so, money wasn’t the issue to worry about the most when it came to find~ing a new fiancee.\n\n\n Where would you find a girl who is willing to marry a guy who came from the temple?!"

Move it, Gutenberg.”\n\n\n The foreman laughed, completely ignoring my complaints and packed the goods into his bag before shoving the door open.\n\n\n I trudged behind him with a heavy box that stored the metal letter pieces. Today was the day my Ieherl task was due and I was bringing it over to the Smithing Guild for its evaluation. The others in the workshop sent us off with a polite smile.\n\n\n “Hey Gutenberg, remember to show off you work well.”\n\n\n “Enough with the ‘Gutenberg’! My name is Johann!”\n\n\n “Kekeke. It’s rare for someone to be bestowed a title from their contractor. It’s a huge honour worth bragging about to the guild.”\n\n\n …Ngh! Why does everyone keep teasing me?!\n\n\n Because of all the foreman’s teasing, everyone in the guild was calling me ‘Gutenberg’ now. But to be honest, the one who caused this was Myne, my only customer.\n\n\n Feeling the weight of the box in my arms, my thoughts went back to the title she conferred me this title.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n It all took place on the day I went to the Gilberta Company to show them the completed order.\n\n\n I would consistently bombard my customers with questions on their orders such that no one was willing to be my customer other than Myne. She was so small and one would doubt that she had been baptized already, you really can’t judge a book by its cover. What was more surprising was that she didn’t act like a small girl with the questions she asked, the blueprints she made and the amount of money she offered.\n\n\n She made an order with me to make some metal letter blocks. Each block needed to be precise down to its exact measurement, this was an exciting job but an insanely tough one too.\n\n\n …I hope Lady Myne will be happy with it, I pondered how she would react and pulled down the cloth to reveal the letter blocks inside to my only customer. I shut my eyes and waited for her response to it that would determine my future.\n\n\n “Amazing…”\n\n\n Myne’s eyes were glued onto the letter blocks, and they were sparkling with so much excitement. Her skin was very pale, likely because she seldom went out, as such the blushing on her cheeks were much more obvious. She looked like a girl in love as she clutched her hand against her chest and let out a sigh, there was so much depth in her eyes that you wouldn’t expect to see in a young girl.\n\n\n Her hands trembled as she carefully raised up a letter block and moved it across her small hand. She was treating it as though it was the most precious thing in the world.\n\n\n …Well, glad to see that she likes them.\n\n\n I released a sigh of relief at this and Myne’s gaze hardened to give her a more calm and serious look. She picked up another letter block and placed them next to each other on the table, she bent over to look at them at eye-level. She squinted her eyes as she began to check for any differences in their width and height.\n\n\n D-do they look fine?\n\n\n I started to get anxious again as I awaited her appraisal.\n\n\n “They’re perfect! You’re really the incarnation of Gutenberg!”\n\n\n “Huh?”\n\n\n “Johann, I dub thee “Gutenberg’!?\n\n\n …Guten-what?\n\n\n My jaw went slack as I stared at Myne with an idiotic epression. My impression of her as a fragile little princess, like a carefully raised, pretty flower, was completely shattered at this moment.\n\n\n Lutz was trying to get Myne to calm down, but there was no containing her. His attempts went ignored as she jumped up onto her chair and began babbling about something with an even more flushed expression.\n\n\n “But, this marks the start of the printing era! You’re now witnessing a historical moment right now! This is the rebirth of Gutenberg! The first’s given name was Johannes, and from today onwards he will go by the name Johann! What an amazing coincidence! A once-in-a-lifetime encounter! Praise thee gods!”\n\n\n …Yup, she’s not making sense to me.\n\n\n I recalled being forced to do this odd pose in the temple during my coming of age ceremony, but I have never seen anyone use this pose and thank the gods in their daily life. Everyone was still stupefied by this, but Myne continued on.\n\n\n “Gutenberg is a famous craftsman on par with a god, whose work forever reshaped history and the world of books. Johann is, without a doubt, the city’s Gutenberg!”\n\n\n I hadn’t finished rendering the supposed importance of this title I was given when Myne started calling Benno and Lutz the same way too. It would appear I had earned myself some comrades. But anyways, the main issue at hand was that we needed someone to stop her and save us from this weird atmosphere.\n\n\n I was sending a meaningful look towards the attendant behind Myne. He had a sort of arrogant looking face. Just then, Myne started posing again and was praying to the Goddess of Wisdom, Metisaura. In the next second, Myne collapse forward, locked into that praying pose with a blissful smile. She felt flat on the ground and the room went into an awkward silence.\n\n\n “…Ah?! Lady Myne?!”\n\n\n “Girl, are you okay?!”\n\n\n “Wh-What on earth?!”\n\n\n It appeared that only Myne’s servant, the foreman and I had been stunned by this scene. Her attendant ran up to her side to see if she was ok while the foreman and I stood stumped to the ground. Other than us, everyone else just sighed.\n\n\n “That took a while. I can finally relax again,” Benno said, he hadn’t even shifted from his seat.\n\n\n Benno, Lutz and the others in the room didn’t even flinch at this.\n\n\n “Fran, carry her to that bench. She will be returning to the carriage soon anyways.”\n\n\n “Yes, sire. Please excuse me, Lord Damuel.”\n\n\n The attendant named Fran lifted up Myne who was still unconscious and carried her to the bench that was next to the fireplace. I was confused as to why he took an extra step to lay a thick and cosy looking blanket over her though. His movements were so quick and precise that it made me assume that they had predicted this to happen.\n\n\n I hadn’t said a word since because I was too shocked. At that moment, Benno started drumming his fingers on the table.\n\n\n “Well then, let’s give the goods another look. I’ll take over for Myne since she’s unconscious. Would that be fine?”\n\n\n “What…? Aren’t you going to help her?”\n\n\n I shifted my gaze towards the bench where the unconscious Myne laid, completely confused with what we should be doing for the small girl who passed out out of the blue. This situation wasn’t sitting right with me.\n\n\n “Say something would you, Lutz?”\n\n\n “I suppose she will come to around sunset. She will probably end up in bed with a fever after this, but that’s her own fault, really.” Lutz said so nonchalantly. It appeared that he was used to Myne’s odd antics.\n\n\n “How long will she have this fever for?” Fran asked.\n\n\n “…It all depends on how long she’s going to stay this stirred up. I can’t say for sure since I haven’t seen her this excited before.”\n\n\n I concluded from their conversation that it wasn’t rare for Myne to pass out. But I still wished that someone had given me a heads up on this, because it felt like my heart had stopped for a split second.\n\n\n “Well, this order review should be an easy one. It must be spectacular given that it made it’s customer pass out from sheer excitement, huh.”\n\n\n “You can say that again, she was obviously excited,” the foreman added on. “Please do the appraisal, Benno. But it would be great to know what’s their use.”\n\n\n The foreman sent his gaze towards the box of letter blocks when the younger attendant of Myne’s jerked as though he remembered something and took out something he had been carrying.\n\n\n “Let me show it to you. Sister Myne asked me to bring this.”\n\n\n “What are you planning to do, Gil?”\n\n\n “Obviously. I’m going to put some ink on them and print stuff. Haha.”\n\n\n Gil was really excited by this as he whipped out the items he was going to use. He placed a rolling pin, some paper, a bottle of ink and an odd round looking thing onto the table. The rolling pin that Myne had ordered from me was entirely black now. But it wasn’t strange for it be so seeing how Gil was lathering it with ink.\n\n\n “Sister Myne said that the letter blocks are supposed ot be arranged in the order you want the text to look like on the paper. After that you put on the ink.” Gil explained while simultaneously using the roller to apply the ink onto the letter blocks, dying them from their previously shiny silver to a dense black.\n\n\n “Wait, wait, wait!”\n\n\n I jumped up in surprise when Gil started dirtying the letter blocks Myne ordered without her permission, but he ignored me and fixed a paper on top of the letter blocks.\n\n\n “The real process actually uses a press of sorts to spread the ink onto the paper. Since this just a demonstration of the letter blocks’ use we’ll substitute it with a simplified version,” Gil puffed up his chest in pride. After that he used the flat side of the circular thing to press the paper down, pushing it around in circles. It appeared that I was the only one who was disturbed by this because everyone was glued onto what Gil was doing with an excited look.\n\n\n “After making sure the ink has been printed on, you can remove the paper and set it aside to dry.”\n\n\n Gil pulled off the paper to display the lines of clear black letters on it. He continued this again to make an identical copy on a separate paper. Gil broke into a large smile and held out the two sheets of paper for us to see.\n\n\n …That’s it? I don’t get why this is supposed to be amazing. I only see it as a huge waste of paper, I thought to myself. But after looking at everyone else, it seemed like I was the only one who thought so\n\n\n Benno, the foreman and Myne’s bodyguard expression turned serious when they saw the paper. Especially Myne’s bodyguard, Samuel. He looked quite shaken by this, he couldn’t stop staring at the two sheets of paper with a grim gaze.\n\n\n “You made these in such a short period of time?,” he said. “Unbelievable.”\n\n\n On the other hand, the foreman took some of the clean letter blocks into his hand and arranged them together, saying “Each one of them is a letter so it’s easy for you to rearrange them and print any text you wish to make.”\n\n\n “Well, Myne said that they were supposed to be much easier to use than making stencils every time,” Lut’s comment made everyone scrunch their eyebrows.\n\n\n “Myne was right. This is revolutionary. I thought I knew everything about printing, but I hadn’t expected the letters to be this easy to use.”\n\n\n Benno shook his head with an exasperated voice, “What has this bonehead gotten herself into this time…?”\n\n\n What Benno said really reflected everyone’s thoughts. Everyone turned their heads simultaneously to look at the knocked out Myne. It seemed like I was the only one out of the loop here. But one thing I knew for sure was that by having Myne as my patron, my life was about to take a huge turn.\n\n\n “Myne did say that the printing press is currently in production, but it will take some time before she puts things into action, I suppose,” Benno sounded more cheerful this time, but he was shot down by the foreman’s next comment.\n\n\n “She said is going to place an order with the woodworkers soon, so I suppose that she has a rough blueprint for one. And if she managed to reproduce a detailed blueprint like the one she gave Johann before, we can expect to see a printing press very soon.”\n\n\n Myne knew how to think out her blueprints and make them precise. This was evident from how she made one for me that had all the details I could ever ask for. If she could make one for the carpentry workshop, making a press won’t take long.\n\n\n Benno scratched his head.\n\n\n “That might be true but the full impact of the printing press will take time to materialize. This is the one and only city to have started a plant-based paper workshop, and it hadn’t been long since we made a contract with the Ink Guilt to make the necessary inl. Furthermore, there aren’t enough materials so the speed of production cannot reach its full potential. But wait… the workshops in the other cities will only open up in spring, so I suppose the revolution is close.”\n\n\n He suddenly turned to glare at me. His reaction had changed so much that it made me freeze.\n\n\n “Johann, you will go by ‘Gutenberg’ from today onwards. Myne conferred you this title so you have no escape,” Benne spoke with lots of spite.\n\n\n I didn’t know what to say so I just nodded my head furiously.\n\n\n This is scaring me. I’ll do whatever she demands of me, so please let me go.\n\n\n Benno seemed satisfied with my response and nodded back. He clearly heard my inner plea of submission.\n\n\n “Good.”\n\n\n … I don’t have any other patrons anyways.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n Thinking about what unfolded at the Gilbert Company made me nibble on my lip in anxiety. Just then the foreman told me that we needed to return there to tell them the guild’s evaluation of the letter blocks.\n\n\n I flinched when he said this because I thought he had heard my thoughts but I was probably mistaken.\n\n\n We walked to the Smithing Guild together. The Guild was located in the central district of town, at the square of the town plaza. This square was filled with numerous guilds and the Merchant’s Guild was the largest of them all. To the southwest of the square was for the crafting guilds, ranging from the Smithing Guild, to the Carpentry Guild and the Building Guild. At the northwest was the Tailor’s Guild and the Dyeing Guild and to the south east was the Hotel Guild and the Restaurant Guild. As for the northeast, it was for the Merchant’s Guild and a building soldiers used for discussions.\n\n\n Spring was back again so the city was back to life with people making trips to and fro the various guilds.\n\n\n We entered the always busy Smithing Guild. Some were here with the intention to sell the things they had made over winter, while others were here to hand up their Ierhel work. Anyways, the whole place was bustling.\n\n\n “Sup, Johann. I heard that you found yourself a patron, hm? Congratulations, man.” the receptionist was always worried about me. I was pretty infamous here for not being able to find a patron.\n\n\n I titled my body back to raise up the box of letter blocks to let him see them.\n\n\n “Yup, they were well praised by my patron, too. Looks like things are getting better for me.”\n\n\n Now that I had a patron and they gave the completed order excellent views, I didn’t have to worry about losing my Ieherl job. Though the task still needed to be evaluated by the Smithing Guild, I wasn’t anxious about what they would say because keeping my job secure was the only thing I cared about.\n\n\n “That’s all you’re going to care about, huh? It’s a shame a talented man like you doesn’t try to be more ambitious,” the receptionist commented.\n\n\n Everyone around me said the same thing, but I thought otherwise. To be honest, having a bad or good appraisal from the Smithing Guild wasn’t going to help me get more patrons. That was because in the end it was the customers who determined the value of my work, not the workshop or the guild.\n\n\n The foreman and I made our way upstairs and we ran into a couple of Ieherls. It seemed like they all just had their coming of age ceremony too as they were all carrying on what was likely their Ieherl assignment and they were accompanied by their foreman too.\n\n\n “Hey, hey, hey, after complaining so much about not being able to find a patron, you still managed to finish your task in the end,” a boy with short and red hair approached me with an aggressive expression.\n\n\n Since he was here, I guessed that we were similar in age or a year apart. But there was no way for me to confirm that because everyone took different amounts of time to find themselves a patron and to complete their own assignments.\n\n\n Who was this?\n\n\n The only times I went out was to get some materials or to deliver orders under my foreman or colleague’s request, other than that I liked to stay cooped up in the workshop. Frankly, I knew very few people. This made the foreman nag at me all the time, he said that my cold attitude was why I had such a hard time finding a patron.\n\n\n “Who cares what you had to make because mine is definitely better than yours,” the strange boy continued speaking.\n\n\n I didn’t know how to respond to that, let alone talk to someone I didn’t know. I could only squeeze out a little, “Y-yeah.”\n\n\n He puffed out a chuckle and walked back to his foreman.\n\n\n “What’s going on?”\n\n\n “He’s Zach from the Farde’s Workshop,” my foreman told me.\n\n\n “He sees you as a rival. I’m sure you know that everyone is competing for the best appraisal, right? Stop acting like an idiot. If someone tries to pick a fued with you, strike them down first!”\n\n\n I was surprised by what the foreman said. Everyone knew that Farde’s workshop was the most famous and popular smithy in this entire city, if this Zack person was a Ieherl there he must be quite a talented smith.\n\n\n Hmm. Thinking about it the foreman did say something about there being a talented smith my age.\n\n\n After the third bell, a few of the guild members walked in to grade our tasks. We walked up to them when they called our names, then we each explained what our patrons ordered, what we did to fulfill it and their review of the final product. Finally, we would present them the order and pass up a physical proof of their review.\n\n\n “This is quite an order.”\n\n\n Well, Myne did send in a large order even though we met each other not that long ago. It was quite rare for a patron to send in their orders one after another this fast, and they didn’t order unusual things like Myne did.\n\n\n “Myne is very pleased with Johann’s work. And she is very detailed with the things she wishes to order,” the foreman chipped into the discussion and showed them a blueprint Myne gave me before. Since every guild member here was a smith too, they could understand how detailed the order was.\n\n\n “Anyways, who is Myne? I have never heard of her. What does her workshop do?” one of the guild members asked with a confused expression when he saw Myne’s name on the board. It was only then did I realise that I myself didn’t know what workshop my patron ran.\n\n\n “U-uhm…” I fumbled on my words.\n\n\n Just then the foreman patted me on the shoulder and gestured to a corner of the board with the appraisal.\n\n\n “Forewoman Myne has not come of age so Benno from the Gilberta Company is acting as her guardian. You should ask him or the Merchant Guild instead.”\n\n\n “She is tied with the Gilberta Company?” the employee muttered under his breath. The guild members were definitely impressed when they saw Benno’s signature on the board.\n\n\n The Gilberta Company was one of the biggest stores in the duchy of Ehrenfest. This wasn’t some old store with a dated history, but one that was constantly developing and increasing their profits every day. Since Myne had their support, it meant that she was quite a big-time patron.\n\n\n “Ok then, let’s see what you have made,” the guild member said now that they had confirmed the authenticity of my patron. Hearing so, I proceeded to take away the cloth in the box and reveal the contents.\n\n\n “What on earth are these?”\n\n\n Ha, I reacted the same way too.\n\n\n Gil had gone out of his way to demonstrate how the letter blocks worked, but I was still confused why they were an important item. I was sure that no smith could understand their worth when they first looked at it.\n\n\n “It’s called a letter block. Each of these are made of metal and have a specific letter on them. Johann, tell them more about the order.”\n\n\n “Yes, foreman. The most crucial part of this order is that each block needs to have the same dimensions. The height needs to be the same so that the top surface is completely flat when they are lined up together. I’ll demonstrate it.”\n\n\n I selected a few of the letter blocks and arranged them in a row, after that I bent over like what Myne did to see them at eye-level. The other guild members followed me and stared at the letter blocks.\n\n\n “That’s some precise work right there.”\n\n\n “I heard that they would shatter apart if they aren’t evenly made.”\n\n\n They didn’t understand the use of the letter blocks but they knew the level of difficulty of this task. The guild members nodded to express their appreciation of the work and praised me for being able to be this precise.\n\n\n “The Gilberta Company said that this is going to be a revolutionary piece of invention,” the foreman said. He had reiterated what Benno had said and everyone had mixed reactions to this; some laughed it off, thinking that it was a joke, and some grew nervous as they believed that his claims could be true.\n\n\n “Johann was dubbed the title of “Gutenberg’ because he made these. Apparently this title is only given to accomplished men and women that have or will leave their mark in history. Johann and the higher-ups of the Gilberta Company have been given this title.” the foreman announced this in a boisterous voice.\n\n\n Everyone grew excited by this, while I wanted to roll up into a ball and die of embarrassment.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n “So, how was it?” Benno asked.\n\n\n The foreman and I were back at the Gilberta Company after finishing my appraisal at the Smithing Guild. We were back here to deliver the letter blocks to Myne and to tell them the Smithing Guild’s appraisal of them. We were guided to the same room we were in last time, that’s where we met Benno who asked this.\n\n\n “Johann received the highest grade. But this was within my expectations because no other apprentice could do such precise work like Johann.”\n\n\n Myne was my only patron, but I had done so many orders for her and each of them were out-of-this-world and called for high-tech work to be done. Furthermore, they were worth lots of money. Adding on the fact that I was given a title too. Though everyone in the workshop and the foreman was using it to tease me, everyone else saw a title as something very honourable.\n\n\n But I don’t want this honour!\n\n\n It was because everyone was going bonkers about my title of “Gutenberg’ that Zach had scored behind me. Frankly, that wasn’t helping me because that made me earn his hatred. He burst into rage when he found out about his placement, saying that this was a mistake because I had such a notorious reputation for not being able to get a patron for forever.\n\n\n Believe me, Zach. I would gladly hand over this title of “Gutenberg” if possible. I just want to do things for my patron and improve on myself to make that possible, I don’t care for any titles.\n\n\n “Stop overthinking about this, Johann. It’s important to get a good appraisal,” the foreman patted me on my shoulder as he said this.\n\n\n Mark nodded at this too.\n\n\n “Your foreman is right. It’s important for one to maintain a good reputation for the sake of their workshop. As an Ieherl, you should think about what you need to do for your workshop’s future.”\n\n\n I only really cared about honing my skills that I never once bothered to think about the workshop’s future and its reputation in the Smithing Guild. It would seem that I needed to change my ways if I wanted to do my best as an Ieherl.\n\n\n “Anyways, merchants and craftsmen have their own sets of value. You can continue focusing on your work, Johann. That itself will help lift our workshop’s reputation. Don’t worry about it, I will take care of the workshop with the others. Continue working on yourself and get yourself another patron as talented as Myne.”\n\n\n “…Sir.”\n\n\n Though the foreman always did his best to tease me, he was still a reliable man. This made me tear up and I made an oath to work even harder.\n\n\n Mark broke into a gentle smile.\n\n\n “If that’s so, Johann, please take this chance to improve your abilities. These are from Myne,” he held out a stack of paper that was folded. I was careful in opening them up because these were precious blueprints that contained my new task.\n\n\n “Huh?!”\n\n\n The blueprints were for different types of letter blocks. Some were blank ones and others were symbols. I clutched onto the paper, I was not ready to go back to those hellish days of making letter blocks again.\n\n\n “What… what is this?”\n\n\n “These are additional orders from Myne, she said she would like you to make them if your first order was good. She also mentioned that she would order more versions of different sizes after you’re done with this order.” Mark said, trying his best to sound encouraging.\n\n\n But that wasn’t making me feel better. He looked like he was smiling because he was glad that someone was taking over some troublesome work.\n\n\n “Looks like you found yourself a very capable patron, right?”\n\n\n I felt the foreman slap my shoulder, and the weight of it felt heavier than the entire world. I glared back at him and came into contact with those eyes he always had right before he was going to tease me.\n\n\n “Your name is going down in history if you manage to finish all of them, Gutenberg~”\n\n\n “Boss, please stop calling me that!” I complained and clutched onto my head.\n\n\n “To think I actually looked up to you for a split second. Give me back my feelings!”\n\n\n Lutz shrugged and said, “Your luck ran out when you met Myne. Stop resisting, Gutenberg.”\n\n\n “Since you’re the first person she gave the title, you’re the real Gutenberg, Johannm” Benno chipped in with a frown.\n\n\n That sent a chill down my back. They were all trying to ditch this title and make me suffer alone. I wasn’t going to walk down this path myself… Or more like, I wasn’t going to let my comrades ditch their responsibilities. I knew what I needed to do now.\n\n\n “Lutz, Mister Benno, we are all Gutenbergs. Please remember that Lady Myne said this herself!”\n\n\n Benno clicked his tongue and shot me a glare, but I wasn’t going to back down this time.\n\n\n “You know, I think you would suit the position of the master Gutenberg, Benno. After all you are the wisest and oldest amongst us.”\n\n\n “Na-ah. Nice try, Johann. But nothing matters because you are the first one to receive the title.”\n\n\n “Where did that logic come from?!”\n\n\n In the end, no one wanted to take the position of master Gutenberg. When I brought this up to Myne and suggested that Benno should be the master Gutenberg, she brushed it off with, “Don’t worry. You are all Gutenbergs. It’s an equal position.”\n\n\n Ahh! I didn’t want that response.\n\n\n It is said that the historians recorded this moment as the birth of Ehrenfest’s Association of Gutenbergs. They were also known as the students of the Goddess of Wisdom, and would dedicate their entire life to developing printing and spreading books across the world."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Spring had just begun and the Spring Prayer was over. The green shoots were getting greener by the day, they no longer resembled their once withered form. The morning sun was shining bright but a rain shower had started right after noon, this was truly a rain of blessings. The farmers thanked the Goddess of Water Flutrane for helping to water their fields. After their lunch, they spent their time on craftwork.\n\n\n Down the road in the middle of the now empty fields was an opulent looking carriage. The side of the door had a metal carving of a family crest, displaying to the outsiders that the passenger was of high status. It was just that today was an unlucky day because the bad coincidence of the rain had made the roads muddy which made it hard for the carriage to move. And inside the carriage was someone who was frustrated at how the roads here were much slower than that of the city’s stone pavement.\n\n\n “…I guess Flutrane doesn’t feel like being amicable today.”\n\n\n Out of all the possible days, why would you choose to make it rain on the day I leave? Bezewanst lamented to Flutrane and also cursed at the shaky carriage.\n\n\n He arrived at Klaus’s summer manor just before the fifth bell. The manor was located near the border of the Central province of Ehrenfest.\n\n\n “Welcome to my humble abode, Lord Bezewanzt,” Klauz greeted Bezenwanzt who was making his way down his carriage. His large belly would sway every time he stepped down.\n\n\n He was guided to the large dressing room that was filled with the chatter of about ten nobles. It was just that the vicinity was clear of any other carriage, so he must have been the only one to have taken one. The others here were full-bred nobles that had used their highbeasts as their mode of transport, they did so probably to avoid anyone (including their own servants) from finding out about this secret meeting,\n\n\n Bezewanzt saw Klauz’s shifty eyes and knew that he had been forced by Noble Gherlach to be the host of the meeting at his own manor. It was quite common for archnobles and midnobles to make the lower-ranking nobles host meetings in their own territories.\n\n\n Bezewanst didn’t find any of this unusual and made his way down to the highest seat of honour and sat down like this was the most expected thing to do. While receiving the greetings of the other nobles, he noticed that Klaus was talking to a noble he hadn’t seen before.\n\n\n “Count Biendewald, the man over there is Bezewanzt, he is the High Bishop of Ehrenfest,” Klaus gestured over.\n\n\n “Oh, the High Bishop, is that so…?”\n\n\n In actual fact, Bezewanzt wasn’t a real noble because he was sent away to the temple. If this was a normal case, the nobles in this mansion would never let a man from the temple sit at the highest seat of honour, but they yielded it to Bezewanzt because his mother and father were once candidates to inherit the archduke position, in other words, Bezewanzt had the blood of a pure archnoble.\n\n\n The sole reason why Bezewanzt was sent to the temple was because he was ordered to by the previous head of this land, Leisegang. Bezewanzt had a surprisingly little amount of mana for someone in his family and his mother died shortly after giving birth to him. Now that there was no one left to protect him, Leisegang, who was from the same family as his father’s current wife, had asked his father to send him to the temple. As such, he wore the robes of a priest since he was a baby. Ever since he was a baby, he was raised to be a priest, not a noble.\n\n\n It was just that his older sister from the same mother saw him as his only blood-related family so she greatly treasured him. That was why the nobles here dared not to mistreat him as his trust was necessary to gain connections to his older sister.\n\n\n “Lord Bezewanzt, this is Count Biendewald from Ahrensbach. He is a supporter of our faction.”\n\n\n Despite being introduced as a count, Bezewanzt knew that this individual was an archnoble in his own duchy. Bezewanzt knew that he was a fairly large individual, but he realised that Biendewald was not that dissimilar in figure. He had very shifty looking eyes, he had the look of an impulsive criminal.\n\n\n Bezewanzt ignored how Biendewald was not trying to hide how he was looking down on him even though he was the High Bishop, and he tried to return a polite nod. He was the most powerful person here today, so it was natural that guests take the initiative to greet him.\n\n\n “May I offer you a blessing in thanks of this honourable meeting that has been decreed by the iridescent streams of the Goddess of Water Flutrane.”\n\n\n “Please do.”\n\n\n The ring on Biendewald’s left middle finger began to grow a faint green light. This ring was something every noble had because the parents would give one to their children after their baptism.\n\n\n Bezewanzt’ felt his heart tighten when he saw the ring. If it wasn’t for the Leisegans, he wouldn’t be in the temple, and he would have a ring of this himself. The one he had now was from his older sister who gave it to him after this coming of age ceremony, but that did not change the fact that he didn’t get baptised in the Noble’s District and that he didn’t get to go to the Royal Academy.\n\n\n Bezewanzt could see the blatant difference between him and Biendewald glaring back at him, this greatly infuriated him, but it also made him feel good to see nobles like him kneel before him (even though he knew that they just wanted to win his sister’s favour).\n\n\n “Count Biendewald is the one who has been helping to deliver the letter from Lady Georgine.”\n\n\n The nobles gathered here had told him that Biendewald was the intermediary between him and his niece who had been married to a noble in Ahrensbach, located to the south of Ehrenfest. His niece had asked him to help fill some chalices with mana, but he had only heard from her through middlemen from Ehrenfest. He had never met a noble from Ahrensbach before.\n\n\n “I pray that our meeting will be blessed by the Goddess of Time Dregarnuhr.”\n\n\n None of them were truly sincere with their prayers. Nevertheless, the prayers continued until the start of lunch and some well-brewed whisky was brought out. The reddish-brown liquid was poured into everyone’s cup, filling the room with its sweet scent.\n\n\n Klaus took a sip first to show that the whiskey was not poisoned. After that, Bezewanzt lifted up his heavy silver cup. The smooth liquid effortlessly flowed down his tongue and it left behind a stinging sensation. He licked the insides of his cheek to relish in that feeling before swallowing it down. That burning feeling in the back of his throat made him sigh with satisfaction. Klauz had really gone out his way to acquire such an exquisite whiskey for his guests’ enjoyment.\n\n\n “Excuse me, Lord Bezewanzt. May I know if the commoner shrine maiden is here?” Gerlach had asked after seeing that everyone had taken a sip of their drinks.\n\n\n Bezewanzt took another sip while everyone shifted their gaze towards him. They had asked for the commoner with Devouring because they wanted to buy her, but she was not in sight.\n\n\n “I did not bring her here.”\n\n\n “W-why?”\n\n\n Bezewanzt returned a contemptful gaze to the nobles that had a surprised look.\n\n\n “Why do I have to ride a carriage with a commoner like here? I will not stay in the same space as her, let alone prepare another carriage for her.”\n\n\n “I would have been glad to prepare a carriage if asked…”\n\n\n The nobles were disappointed at this, but Bezewanzt found it difficult to take away Myne without getting caught by the High Priest first. He had intended for Delia to bring her out, but that was impossible because the meticulous attendant that used to serve the High Priest never left them together. That plan would definitely fail and it would make it harder by raising the High Priest’s guard.\n\n\n Why on earth does someone like me, who carries the blood of an archduke, have to put myself in danger for them? Bezewanst was pensive and thought out his excuse to put the blame on Gerlach\n\n\n “In fact, they have tightened their security because of the failed attack during the Spring Prayer. It is already a blessing that I managed to avoid their suspicions.”\n\n\n “…I see, that is a shame. The plan to attack her using Count Biendewald’s soldiers with Devouring was not successful.”\n\n\n Their attempt to kidnap Myne during the Spring Prayer had failed miserably. It would have been a trivial task for nobles with mana to kidnap a commoner shrine, but their failure was no doubt attributed to the intervention of the High Priest Ferdinand. Afterall, he was a noble who had mana too.\n\n\n “It’s all because of that annoying High Priest.”\n\n\n “What bad luck. I want to make that peasant girl suffer, make her and Lord Ferdinand writhe in pain,” Viscountess Dahdolf cursed Myne and Ferdinand with deep hatred. It was all because of Myne that her beloved son was punished after the trombe extermination.\n\n\n Bezewanzt had condemned Ferdinand and asked for his sister to lessen Shikza’s punishment on her behalf, but truthfully, he cared not for the man at all. Bezewanzt hated Shikza for getting the chance to leave the temple during the political confusion in the government.\n\n\n “Lord Ferdinand appears to be a more formidable opponent than we had hoped for. If Myne had stayed at the Leisegang’s manor during the kidnapping attempt, we could have put the blame on them instead…” Gerlach trailed off and he looked at Bezewanzt with a bitter look.\n\n\n Useless imbecile, Bezewanzt cursed him on the inside. He wanted them to kidnap Myne during the Spring Prayer, doing so would wash him clean of that troublesome commoner and he could use the chance to condemn the High Priest. Bezewanzt was eagerly anticipating the news of the attack from the temple, but they had returned without any harm. That greatly annoyed him.\n\n\n “We instigated the residents living near our borders to join in on the attack but none of them returned. They had all been obliterated in the fight, even though half of the force consisted of Ehrenfest people,” Biendewald added on. His words made Viscount Snitzern, the noble of the neighbouring land Garduhn, knit his eyebrows in worry.\n\n\n “Even so, Viscount Garduhn did not say anything about the mass disappearance of his people. Was it possible he didn’t see the attack because it was off to the border…?”\n\n\n “That does sound quite strange…”\n\n\n Was the attack only directed at those from the other duchies? Was that even possible? They wanted to find out more but Viscount Garduhn was close to the Leisegangs. He did not attend the gathering and was unaware of what unfolded during the Spring Prayer. With no living witnesses at hand, they had no way of finding out what happened that day.\n\n\n “The commoners were not the only casualty. Half of my Devouring forces perished. There were even a couple of them who could wield mana and its tools at the level of a lower-ranking noble. They were a crucial force to do work on the hidden side that helped me keep myself clean. It is such a shame to lose them. I wanted to acquire that shrine maiden to increase their numbers,” Biendewald gave a hefty chuckle, and it sounded awful, like a croaking toad.\n\n\n Bezewanzt frowned at this, showing his dispreference to selling Myne to him. They nobles around Biendewald exchanges looks and moved to flatter him with fake smiles.\n\n\n “Lord Bezewanzt, it would be a tremendous honour if you could assist me as the High Bishop in making that commoner shrine maiden sign a submission pact with me. Having your wisdom and power would be tremendously helpful,” one of the nobles said.\n\n\n “We all understand how irritating it must be for you to be near that arrogant commoner. A partnership between us will be mutually beneficial, no?” another noble chipped in.\n\n\n Indeed, Bezewanzt did find Myne annoying and dangerous, having her disappear would settle his nerves and he would love to see the reaction of Ferdinand, who was supposedly her ‘guardian’ when that happened. But Bezewanst knew not to be the one to take action. Ferdinand would surely try to get back at him for forcing Myne to sign a submission pact, and he would need lots of luck and the brains to avoid him.\n\n\n “We are only dealing with a commoner anyways. She’s not that different from a gray orphan, don’t you think so?” one of the nobles asked.\n\n\n “That is not so, she might be a gray apprentice maiden, but she had the mana of a blue robed noble. It is unusual for a commoner to have the ability of Crushing.”\n\n\n Bezewanzt had been a victim to Myne’s Crushing, so he was clear on how much mana she possessed. He did admit that he had put down his guard, but it didn’t change the fact that she did not have a pathetic amount of mana a Devouring commoner her age would usually give. Her vast mana was further proven when she assisted Ferdinand in the Dedication Ceremony. That was a ritual that could only be performed by two individuals with a similar amount of mana.\n\n\n “She is a precocious thing, I do not wish to experience her Crushing again. All of you have sufficient magic tools at hand to protect yourself, but I do not possess the resources to defend myself against a Crushing. Why would I ever endanger myself to sell a commoner?”\n\n\n Biendewald stroked his thick chin and he thought to himself, after that he fished out a round thing wrapped in a cloth from his hip pocket. He proceeded to carefully unwrap its contents.\n\n\n “What is this…?”\n\n\n ‘This is a darkness-attributed manastone that absorbs mana. The Crushing of a commoner will be rendered useless with this. May I present this to you in commemoration of our meeting?”\n\n\n Bezewanzt smiled at the dark and opaque stone. There was no way a mere commoner child could do anything to him with this. He would make her sorry for offending a man of an archduke’s descent.\n\n\n Biendewald saw that Bezewanzt was very pleased with this stone, he smirked at this and raised it towards him.\n\n\n “Will I take that as a yes?” he asked him with a wicked look in his eyes. He knew that this was enough to convince Bezewanzt to sell Myne to him.\n\n\n Bezewanzt didn’t like to bend to someone else’s demands, but he had been driven to the edge by Myne who wanted nothing more than to sell her to another duchy. He also wanted to push her parents (those disgusting imbeciles who dared to stand in his way) into the darkest abyss of despair. So of course he was tempted to take the black mana stone Biendewald offered.\n\n\n Bezewanzt tried to alter his way of thinking; he wasn’t bending to Biendewald’s demand, but he was just doing this for his sister.\n\n\n Ferdinand had publicly declared to the Knight Order that he would take Myne under his protection. There was no doubt that taking her away would deal a big hit on Ferdinand’s pride, his sister would surely be overjoyed to see him duffer. Furthermore, that would appease the mourning Viscountess Dahldolf\n\n\n Furthermore, the nobles with me would surely be happy to see me strengthen my relationship with Count Biendewald.\n\n\n Now he had no qualms with taking the stone because he had a valid reason for doing so. Bezenwanzt gave a nefarious smile to Bienwald’s craft gaze.\n\n\n “I will be glad to welcome you at the temple whenever. My older sister will support us too.”\n\n\n Bezewanzt consent at this alliance made the nobles burst out in happy chatter. Some expressed their delight at this matter. Bezewanzt was aware that they were excited to be associated with his sister’s authority, but he paid it no heed.\n\n\n “Ah, I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us,” Bezewanzt made a cheering motion with his cup. He shifted his gaze out the window and saw that the rain over Ehrenfest was getting heavier. But the sound of the upcoming storm pleased his ears."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Today was my first day as Kamil’s older sister. This was surely a life-changing event. I had made the resolve to act more like an older sister but sleep, my biggest enemy, was winning over me. Mum had gone into labour at dawn and Kamil was only birthed slightly before the third bell. I had gotten sleepy after lunch because of all the running around I did in the morning.\n\n\n No, stop! I can’t fall asleep now! I need to help Mum do the dishes and the other chores. Let me help out with some work until Dad or Tuuli comes back from the celebration to help out with the rest.\n\n\n I was doing my best to fight against the sleep but Mum patted on the spot next to her.\n\n\n “Myne, come and sleep if you want to.”\n\n\n “No, I won’t. I’ll stay awake until Dad or Tuuli comes back. I need to act more like a capable sister that can look after Kamil,” I responded to Mum.\n\n\n I didn’t feel like napping because Kamil was finally here. Though I had only carried him once, my feelings to look after him were strong. Mum gave an awkward smile to my little protest.\n\n\n “I’m glad you feel that way but I’m worried that you will fall sick. Rest if you feel tired, alright?” she replied and I gave a disappointed nod.\n\n\n Mum was exhausted after giving birth, I needed to stop creating more worries for her. After washing the dishes, I took off my shoes and got up on the bed. I made sure to stay closer to the edge so I wouldn’t squish Kamil. I flipped over to look at his sleeping face.\n\n\n Your sister will start doing her work tomorrow, alright?”\n\n\n It didn’t take long for me to fall asleep. I vaguely felt Mum cover me with the blanket and stroke my head, I didn’t know what happened after that. Later, in the midst of my deep sleep, I was awoken by a high-pitch crying that sounded like a meowing cat. My sleep had been cut short, and I was annoyed at being awoken.\n\n\n Shut it… I want to sleep, I thought to myself and tugged onto the blanket to cover my head, but the crying just grew louder when I did that\n\n\n …Argh! Who is crying next to me?! Huh, oh! Kamil!\n\n\n I flung open my eyelids and Mum was in front of me with Kamil in her arms, it seems she was going to breastfeed Kamil now.\n\n\n She noticed me and smiled, “You slept well, love. The fifth bell is about to ring.”\n\n\n Though I had slept for a while, I was still feeling quite sleepy. After rubbing my eyes, I turned to look at Kamil. The small chub was doing his best to drink the milk. His scrunched face and dazed look, along with that tiny clenched fist was so cute.\n\n\n “I’m home. Is Kamil awake?”\n\n\n “Hey, Tuuli. Yup, he is drinking his milk now,” I shouted across the door towards Tuuli who just returned from the celebration.\n\n\n She poked her head in and walked to the bedside, she looked at Kamil and commented a “He’s so tiny.”\n\n\n “Both you and Myne were once this small too,” Mum gave a nostalgic smile.\n\n\n I was at a loss of words because I didn’t know how to respond to that. It was not like I could remember that. Just then, Kamil moved his head to the side and he let out a small burp when Mum patted his back.\n\n\n “Myne, you were so slow and clumsy when drinking milk, you always had milk all over your mouth. And after drinking some, you would sometimes puke it out,” Mum reminisced with a smile as she looked at me. She was pretty much saying that I was a troublesome one since birth, and I gave an annoyed face.\n\n\n “I couldn’t do anything about that. I was only a baby then.”\n\n\n “Actually…” Tuuli spoke, “You’re still just as slow when it comes to eating, and you always complain about stomach aches whenever you eat too much. Nothing has changed, really.”\n\n\n “Tuuli, you’re so mean.”\n\n\n “Oh, she’s right though,” Mum supported Tuuli.\n\n\n Now that she had started this, I wasn’t going to back down now. Thinking about it, the bread from here that we usually ate was too hard. I always struggled to chew into it, so I had to soak it in my soup or some sort of liquid first. It wasn’t my fault that the bread took that much time to soften. I was slow because the bread was that hard. It’s not my fault.\n\n\n “Why is it the bread’s fault when you’re the only one who is slow, Myne? You’re slow because you always wait for it to get soggy in your soup.”\n\n\n “I do that because it’s too hard to eat!”\n\n\n In fact, it was even harder for me to chew the bread at home now that I was used to eating the soft bread in the temple. Once again, I was having a new experience eating the cement-like bread again.\n\n\n Mum watched me and Tuuli incessant debate before turning us away with a troubled smile.\n\n\n “I think it’s time for me to change Kamil’s nappies…”\n\n\n “Oh, let me try! I want to do it!”\n\n\n Tuuli’s eyes lit up with excitement and moved in to help change his diaper. I just sat on the side and watched on, I wanted to watch and learn so that I could do my best as his older sister and help out too. Tuuli slowly took off the cloth on his bottom and used the clear part to wipe his bottom. After that she wrapped him in a clean cloth.\n\n\n Tuuli gave a relieved sigh and yelled a “Done!” with a smile. She finished the task swiftly, making it seem really easy.\n\n\n Maybe I’ll try it out next time too.\n\n\n Tuuli bundled up the dirtied cloth and threw it into a basket before looking out the window into the horizon.\n\n\n “Hey Mum… Was that the last diaper left? The sun is pretty much gone but if we don’t wash them now they might get wet in the rain later.”\n\n\n “Oh, yes. We should wash them now. Could you help me out? Gunther helped me tie up some rope in the kitchen to hang the diapers dry. They are quite high up so we might need him to help out.”\n\n\n While Mum and Tuuli busied themselves, I just sat by the window and leaned my head against the panel. There were some clouds hanging around, but the sky was pretty much clear. I couldn’t tell that if there was going to be an overcast, everything seemed normal like usual.\n\n\n “…How do you both know that it’s going to rain soon?”\n\n\n “It’s weirder that you can’t, Myne. If we can’t read the weather, then we can’t tell when it’s safe to enter the forest. Moving on from that, we need to wash the clothes now! Come on, Myne.” Tuuli tugged me towards the door.\n\n\n A sudden realisation struck me. Sir Damuel told me not to leave the house… I did think that it was fine for me to go to the well earlier that day, but I remembered him berating me that me leaving the house might put those around me in danger. Furthermore, with the sudden death guildmaster of the Ink Guild and the attack on Spring Prayer, I shouldn’t risk leaving the house now.\n\n\n Tuuli probably remembered this too because she was there was Damuel warned me, and I watched her shoulders drop in disappointment.\n\n\n “I don’t think it’s wise to ignore a noble’s warning, right? Well then, I’ll just do the laundry myself. You can help out with dinner instead, Myne. Since Dad and I ate quite a fair amount during the celebration, and the neighbours gave us some vegetables and meat, you can just cook some soup.”\n\n\n I looked at the ingredients that I was going to use to make the soup, and recalled that I only had some soup and bread for lunch. I stroked my stomach and said, “I am kind of hungry. I only had some for lunch after all. I haven’t ate the meat gifted from the temple, plus we need to make sure Mum eats well so she can make lots of milk for Kamil…”\n\n\n I was basically hinting that I wanted to eat meat. Tuuli pointed to the pantry and told me I could cook the bird meat.\n\n\n “Well then, I only need to marinate it with some salt and herbs, right?”\n\n\n Tuuli shook her head in response.\n\n\n “There are some herbs that post-natal women can’t eat. You only need to use the salt.”\n\n\n To be honest, I preferred eating meat with herbs to salted meat. I was quite sad about it, but Mum took priority first.\n\n\n “…Well since herbs can’t be used, I can try swapping it out with some of Dad’s wine,” I spoke to myself.\n\n\n I walked into the pantry we used to store food for the winter to search for the meat, after that I took Dad’s wine down from the shelf. Everytime I tried to use his wine for cooking, he would lose his mind and try to stop me. He would say that my food tasted delicious even without the wine, but I knew that was just an excuse to keep the wine to himself.\n\n\n …No matter what Dad says, I’m gonna use the wine!\n\n\n Meat tasted drastically different with and without wine. While waiting for the meat to be marinated in wine and salt, I proceeded to chop the vegetables. I wasn’t comfortable in handling the vegetables with poisonous parts, but at least I could tell the difference between the safe and dangerous ones.\n\n\n “…Huh? Is it me, or have I gotten worse because I’ve been stuck in the temple for so long?!” I cried out.\n\n\n I struggled to cut the vegetables evenly after living the life of a well-off girl in the temple for so many months. In fact, my hands trembled just from gripping onto the knife.\n\n\n “Argh, this is the worst. I was bad enough at doing chores before, and I’ve gotten worse now. I seriously need to start doing chores everyday again,” I mumbled to myself, disappointed at my poor skills while continuing to slowly cut the vegetables without nipping my fingers.\n\n\n “Oh, it’s fargel. It will taste better when cooked with butter rather than boiling them in the soup.\n\n\n Fargel meat looked like white asparagus on the outside, but it tasted like corn kennels. It tasted just like spring and was delicious when cooked with butter, soup or cream.\n\n\n “I’m home!” Dad announced with so much joy and stumbled in drunk. Tuuli was right behind him with the clean laundry in hand.\n\n\n “Dad, help hang these up. We’ll work on supper instead,” Tuuli passed the cleaned diapers to Dad and returned the empty basket back to the storeroom.\n\n\n Dad hung out the diapers onto the strings tied up high in the kitchen. I didn’t feel comfortable with him doing that while I was cooking, but I couldn’t help it because Kamil needed clean diapers.\n\n\n “If the sun was out right now, we could hang them outside.”\n\n\n “Yeah, the rain is so annoying. It’s hard to dry these out when it rains.”\n\n\n Frankly, it was disturbing to have diapers hanging up in the room. I wasn’t used to this, seeing them now really made me appreciate how convenient disposable diapers were. Moreover, these weren’t the white and new diapers I saw as Urano, these diapers were made from rags sewed together and strips of worn out cloth. The only good things about them was that they had softened because they were washed lots of times before.\n\n\n I wanted to search for something more hygienic, but we didn’t have much of a choice right now. And I could predict them saying that they didn’t need new cloth for diapers that would be dirtied frequently.\n\n\n “How is it, Myne?”\n\n\n “I tried to cut as much of the vegetables as possible. It’s probably the end of the season for fargels because they’re getting quite hard,” I lifted up the hard fargels for Tuuli to see.\n\n\n “Well, it’s almost the mid of Spring. Vargels grow better during colder spring days, but I prefer warmer days. That because you can get more stuff from the forest when it’s warm.”\n\n\n While Tuuli worked on the salted meat with the buttered fargels, I continued making the vegetable soup.\n\n\n “Myne, you can call Mum out now,” Tuuli spoke to me.\n\n\n I sneaked into the room as quietly as possible to not disturb Kamil. I saw him sleeping next to Mum. It might have been the dark room, but Mum looked really tired and frail. I didn’t want to wake her up now so I returned back to the kitchen.\n\n\n “Tuuli, Mum’s sleeping…”\n\n\n “It’s ok, we’ll let her sleep. Mrs Karla said that it’s important for mothers to have plenty of rest after giving birth,” Tuuli told me while preparing the table.\n\n\n Apparently she was taught about these things by the midwives when helping out earlier today. Mum looked like she wouldn’t have the strength to do any work, it was our turn as family to look after her.\n\n\n “You’re probably unaware about this because you weren’t around, but it was really hard on Mum. She bled a lot and it looked like she was in lots of pain,” Tuuli whispered to me and looked towards the bedroom with a worried expression.\n\n\n I didn’t see this birth and neither have I seen one as Urano. Though I had read about and heard of them a couple of times, I did not come close to witnessing a real one before. I knew for sure Mum was in lots of pain, and it was not unusual for me to think that she wasn’t doing too good right now.\n\n\n “We need to do our best so that Mum doesn’t need to worry about the house chores. She’s going to have a hard time recovering if she doesn’t get plenty of rest, so Myne, we’ll be counting on you too.”\n\n\n “Yes, ma’am.”\n\n\n That night, I once again woke up to Kamil’s crying. It was impossible to sleep through a baby’s wailing when they’re just next to you. I vaguely recall seeing Mum breastfeed him four times throughout that night. One thing for sure, I was sleep deprived. I woke up with a big migraine that day.\n\n\n “You’ll get used to the crying in a couple of days,” Mum gave a weak smile and comforted me by stroking my head.\n\n\n I told her that wasn’t going to happen anytime soon, but I was proved wrong the next night. I had slept through the entire night without waking to the crying next to me.\n\n\n “…Hm. I might be more adaptable than I thought I was.”\n\n\n “You’re a carbon copy of Dad,” Tuuli shot me a glare with her droopy and sleep-deprived eyes. I looked towards Dad who was still snoring away."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n After all the celebration in the plaza was over, everyone resumed their daily work. I would be returning back to the temple today too. Damuel and Fran fetched me from my house, but we made a stop at the Gilberta Company first. I wanted to thank them for their gifts and to show off to Benno that Kamil was cute. And if possible, I wanted to resume our discussion about the plans for printing.\n\n\n “He’s so tiny as a newborn. He gets so red and wrinkly whenever he cries, he’s so cute. I never would have thought that my baby brother would be this cute,” I indulged in remembering how cute he was. I told Benno the same thing I did for Lutz, Fran and Damuel when walking here.\n\n\n Benno just cringed and massaged his temples.\n\n\n “I get it. I’ve been hearing this nonsense from Otto everyday. Just start talking about your plans for printing already.”\n\n\n “Wait, what? Has Corinna given birth? I didn’t hear of this! When did she give birth?!” My eyes grew with surprise at this news.\n\n\n Benno frowned in response.\n\n\n “Did I not tell you? Well, I might have forgotten to because you were stuck in the temple for so long. Otto has been fawning over his kid so much that I thought that your dad, Lutz or Leon would have told you about it,” Benno explained and looked at Lutz who shrugged.\n\n\n “Leon told me that we shouldn’t be going around talking about your private matters, that’s why I didn’t tell her.”\n\n\n “Hm, you’re right, I guess. Well, I did meet Myne a couple of times after the baby was born, but… it probably slipped my mind because we were so busy. We had to finish the letter blocks and then there was the visit by the blue priests,” Benno reminisced with a tired look. He was drowning with a heavy workload, so he probably didn’t have the time to announce that Corinna had given birth. .\n\n\n “Well, I might as well say it now. The baby arrived right before winter ended. She’s called Renate and she will be the heir to the Giberta Company, so treat her well, yeah.” Benno said all this in such a nonchalant way that I was baffled. He was acting the complete opposite of Dad right now.\n\n\n “You don’t look excited about this, Benno. Weren’t you desperate for a successor?”\n\n\n “I am, but Otto can be excited in my stead. He’s surely going to blindly spoil her, so I need to be strict with her or the Gilberta Company won’t hold when she inherits it,” Benno smirked, but I had my suspicions that he was going to spoil her too even after all that talk.\n\n\n “Why are you looking at me like that?”\n\n\n “Oh, it’s nothing. I feel like you’re going to spoil her as much as Otto.”\n\n\n “Watch what you say,” Benno shot me a glare but I ignored it.\n\n\n “Corinna will raise Renate into a fine lady. She’ll become a capable businesswoman who can keep a poker face when securing a good business deal.”\n\n\n Corinna might have a sweet demeanor, but there were a couple of occasions where she pulled out valuable information from me without my awareness. If this happened with Benno, he would berate me for being so gullible and for trusting others too blindly, but Corinna didn’t do any of that. She would just try to take as much information with me with a gentle smile. Freida was the complete opposite when it came to business, she was very blunt with her words that it was slightly annoying. Corinna got everything she wanted to know by chatting.\n\n\n She’s much scarier than Freida when it comes to business-related things.\n\n\n Frankly, Benno was the nicest merchant I have met so far. Perhaps training me as his apprentice had brought out his sense of duty to look after me, so he would subconsciously act nicer around me.\n\n\n “I practically raised Corrina myself, you do realise that right?”\n\n\n “Well, the Gilberta Company has a long and bright future then.”\n\n\n “That’s obvious,” Benno was pleased with my comment and continued, “Speaking of business, you mentioned that you have some news for the printing business?”\n\n\n “The High Priest said that I needed to postpone using the new printing presses for now. If we are too hasty with printing, we might risk clashing with some nobles. And we have no way of winning against them now?”\n\n\n “…So nobles might get involved? Well then, it’s best for us to pay heed to his advice.”\n\n\n Benno was aggressive when it came to fighting for profits, but he was definitely not going to risk fighting with nobles. I felt relieved that he felt that way, so I continued to tell him what else the High Priest had told me.\n\n\n “Lots of nobles copy books, so we can’t make thick and wordy books for adults (Ria says: I couldn’t really understand what the author was trying to say here.) The High Priest said that it was ok to make children books. So anyways, I’ll be going all out with making children’s books for the next few years.”\n\n\n Benno frowned at this, “Going all out… ? Well then, I would like to hear your plans for this.”\n\n\n I nodded and explained to him my plans for the workshop.\n\n\n “I’ll be upfront with this, I want to make coloured ink to colour the pictures. After that, I want to make some wax stencils that will speed up stencil printing. We need to step on it if we want to get everything done in time.”\n\n\n “What are you preparing for?” Benno asked and I responded with a proud grin.\n\n\n “I will need to make books for Kamil at different ages. I will be working my hardest for him, so it would be great if you could find me a wax workshop.”\n\n\n “Have you received the High Priest’s permission for this?” Benno had an exasperated and doubtful look on his face. I wasn’t that impulsive to start things before asking Benno and the High Priest because they would always nag at me to report and ask them for permission before doing anything first.\n\n\n “The High Priest said that the books for children won’t incite any hard feelings from the nobles, to be honest, he was the one who suggested colouring the pictures. He said something along the lines of ‘It’s such a waste to see Wilma’s art in black and white only, art needed colour, etcetera, etcetera…”\n\n\n “I will be happy to help you as long as you have received permission. I will arrange a time for you to meet a foreman as soon as possible.”\n\n\n That was all I had to discuss with Benno. Now that I had found a possible craftsman from a wax workshop, I left the Gilberta Company in high spirits.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n “Good morning. I’m back.”\n\n\n “Welcome back, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n I was greeted by Delia and Rosina in my chambers, they proceeded to assist me into my blue robes while I told them more about Kamil.\n\n\n “My little brother was just born. He’s called Kamil. He is so tiny and gets all red and wrinkly whenever he cries. He’s just so cute.”\n\n\n “Sister Myne, the way you describe him doesn’t sound cute,” Rosina chuckled at me. It was true that Kamil looked really cute when he got all wrinkly, but I just wasn’t good with my words.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, I don’t think it really matters to us if your brother is cute or not. Why do you wish to tell us about him?” Delia tilted her head in confusion.\n\n\n “I want more people to know about him. I was told that it is important for people to remember when he was born.”\n\n\n After all my talk about how cute Kamil was, it was time for me to head to my harspiel practice. But it didn’t take long for Rosina’s class to get interrupted by a knock on the door downstairs. Shortly after, Fran had made his way upstairs.\n\n\n “Pardon my intrusion, Sister Myne. Wilma would like to seek an audience with you.” he announced, sounding slightly anxious.\n\n\n “Please let her in,” I replied.\n\n\n If Wilma had come all the way here, it must mean that something important had happened in the orphanage.\n\n\n Delia helped me keep away my haspiel and I sat by the table to welcome Wilma. She came upstairs carrying a baby that was bigger than Kamil. Wilma and Fran gave me a troubled look.\n\n\n “Wilma, whose baby is that?” I asked.\n\n\n I had stayed in the temple for quite some time, but I hadn’t heard of any of the gray shrine maidens getting pregnant. It was common for blue priests to send their pregnant attendants back to the orphanage, so this baby definitely wasn’t from here.\n\n\n “The baby was abandoned. He was left with one of the guards…”\n\n\n Wilma explained that one of the patrolling guards at the lower city’s gate was approached by a lady out of the blue. She pushed a bundle of cloth into his arms, claiming she wanted to present an offering to the gods. It wasn’t unusual for people to offer gifts or donations to the gods, so the guard accepted it without any suspicion.\n\n\n “It was only when the guard opened up the bundle that he realised there was a baby inside.”\n\n\n It was part of the guards’ protocol to check the contents of an offering before passing it to the temple.\n\n\n “She wanted to give her child to the gods…?”\n\n\n Parents who were unable to kill or raise their child would usually turn to the orphanage as a last resort, hoping that the gods will look after the kid. This baby was bigger than Kamil and he could move around his head, but he was too young to walk by himself. ‘I was indignant at how a mother could so carelessly abandon their child.\n\n\n “Since you are the director of the orphanage, I decided to bring him here first. What should we do about him?”\n\n\n The orphanage needed the director’s permission before they could take in a new child, but since this was my first time handling this, I was unsure what I needed to do.\n\n\n “Apologies, but I am unclear on such matters. I have not done this before since I first stepped into the position of the direction. It seems I have to consult the High Priest. Fran, would you help send a request for an emergency meeting on my behalf?”\n\n\n “Certainly,” Fran bowed and turned around.\n\n\n This was probably his run into such a situation because he left the room frantically. While all this was happening, the baby was still sleeping soundly in Wilma’s arms, completely ignorant of our worries.\n\n\n “This baby is such a deep sleeper,” I said. His small and sleeping look reminded me of Kamil, and that made me smile.\n\n\n This baby is cute, but my Kamil is the best. Absolutely.\n\n\n “We are fine now because he is still asleep, but I do not know what I should do when he wakes. We do not have any gray shrine maidens who have children. What shall we do about the baby’s milk…” Wilma was at a loss.\n\n\n Whenever a baby was brought into the temple, they lived in the basement and the post-natal or still pregnant gray shrine maidens would feed them. They would practically take in their children as their own. But with all the pregnant shrine maidens gone, we no longer had anyone in the basement to share their knowledge with us.\n\n\n The rest of the shrine maidens and apprentices were girls who had never offered flowers before. They have been living in the orphanage for their entire lives, so they didn’t have any parents to teach them about pregnancy, childbirth or child care. In other words, no one knew how to look after a baby.\n\n\n “Do you perhaps know how to look after a baby, Sister Myne?”\n\n\n “I know that you can swap out breastmilk with goat milk. If I’m not wrong, goat milk is much better than using cow milk. It will be a slow process, but we can feed the baby with a spoon,” I said.\n\n\n I reiterated everything I read from a fictional book set in the medieval times, but Wilma looked as though she had been enlightened. Her eyes glistened with awe and respect.\n\n\n “Thank you so much, Sister Myne. I will go get some right now.:\n\n\n “Remember to prepare some clean cloth for diapers and clothes for the baby too,” I told her what we did for Kamil.\n\n\n “We still have some old cloth from the babies we used to raise. We should be fine with what we have for now.”\n\n\n “Alright.”\n\n\n Some time later, Fran returned from the High Priest’s chambers and I asked him to bring over some goat milk. All of a sudden, the baby woke up and started crying.\n\n\n “He’s probably hungry, I think,” I said.\n\n\n Wilma slowly brought a spoonful of milk to the baby’s mouth. He was initially resistant to it because he realised that Wilma wasn’t his mother, but he eventually succumbed to his hunger and started sipping on the milk.\n\n\n Everyone let out a sigh of relief at this. At least we knew that the baby wouldn’t die of starvation for now.\n\n\n The third bell rang and the baby flinched in surprise, but he didn’t cry because he was too occupied with satisfying his hunger.\n\n\n “Fran, we will head over to the High Priest’s right now. Sir Damiel, please look after me.”\n\n\n We all sped our way down to the High Priest’s chambers. My sisterly-instincts were screaming at me now that Kamil had been born, I wanted to make sure that baby could live here comfortably as soon as possible.\n\n\n “High Priest, I have an important matter to discuss with you.”\n\n\n I informed the High Priest about the baby that was abandoned and seeked advice for him on what I needed to do.\n\n\n “Why don’t you go about it the way it has always been done?”\n\n\n “That is why I am here, we do not have any experienced gray shrine maidens in caring for babies in the orphanage anymore,” I explained and the High Priest flashed a look of surprise.\n\n\n “Yes, I see. But we cannot ask for the impossible right now. There are wet nurses… Unfortunately, I do not know how to care for children.”\n\n\n “So we can hire a wet nurse?” I asked with glee in my eyes.\n\n\n It would be much easier on us if we had one, but sadly, the High Priest shook his head.\n\n\n “…Where would you find one willing to enter the orphanage?”\n\n\n “That’s going to be difficult.’\n\n\n The High Priest was probably giving his input as a noble. But likewise, it was difficult to find anyone in the lower city who was willing to enter the orphanage because the place was frowned upon. Mum might help out, but she needed time to recover first. I wasn’t going to ask her to help out with her current state.\n\n\n Least to say, it was nearly impossible to get a wet nurse to help out. I could only ask my attendants to look after the baby. It was going to be a gruelling task for everyone but we did not have any other alternative right now.\n\n\n “What should his name be? The mother didn’t indicate his name anywhere on his clothes.”\n\n\n “Do as you like. As long as he does not have the same name as another orphan, anything will be fine.”\n\n\n “Alright.”\n\n\n We finished up our talk and I quickly returned to my chambers. The baby was giggling, satisfied with how it had been fed and changed into a new set of diapers.\n\n\n “We will take turns to look after him. It will be too hard on Wilma to look after him alone.”\n\n\n The situation wouldn’t have been this bad if we still had some mothers or pregnant ones in the basement, but now we had to make do with the current gray shrine maidens. They had no experience in carrying babies and there was no one to seek advice from. I wasn’t going to leave Wilma alone in caring for the baby when she had no one else to rely on. Anyone in that situation would be utterly drained of energy.\n\n\n “He will go hungry in the night too. So we will need someone to be on night duty, and someone else needs to wake up earlier to take over.”\n\n\n In the end, we decided that Wilma would take the day shift and look after him in the orphanage, and the rest of my attendants would take turns looking after him in my chambers at night. Rosina was a night-owl, so she took the midnight shift while Fran would sleep earlier to take over. After that, Delia would look after him until it was Wilma’s turn again.\n\n\n “Hey! Why must I look after him too?!” Delia fumed.\n\n\n She was fine with listening to orders from her master, but she wasn’t willing to care for an abandoned baby everyday. I could understand where she was coming from, but the baby needed our constant care if we wanted him to survive.\n\n\n I peeked at Delia from the corner of my eyes.\n\n\n Maybe I could say something to convince her otherwise? Something that will make her happy to care for him.\n\n\n I ruminated for a while before a sudden idea struck me. Delia looked jealous the other time when I talked about my family. She was probably keen on having her very own.\n\n\n “Delia, you are responsible for looking after him. Don’t forget, you are his big sister.”\n\n\n “Huh? Big sister?” Delia was stumped and looked back at the baby and me.\n\n\n “You are too young to be his mother, so of course you are his sister, right Delia? Care for him like you would for your family. Afterall, you are a family.”\n\n\n “A…family?” she stressed those words, still shocked by the meaning of that to her.\n\n\n “I just became a big sister the other day, and you are one too now, Delia. Who do you think will be the better sister?”\n\n\n “Of course, it will be me!” Delia declared with lots of confidence and puffed up her chest. Now it seemed like she was going to give her all for the baby, she looked like she would be a good sister.\n\n\n Deep down, Delia was a forthright and a hardworking person who would put her best into everything she did. My other attendants were happy to see Delia this excited. With someone as diligent as Delia went all out in looking after the baby, caring for him would be much easier for Fran and Rosina.\n\n\n “Well then, let’s give him a name. He cannot have the same name as someone else in the orphanage, so it’s up to us to decide one for him. Any suggestions?”\n\n\n “I want to give him a similar name to mine. Something a family would do,” Delia spoke as she continued looking at the baby in Wilma’s arms avidly.\n\n\n Maybe that will make her like him more.\n\n\n I tried to think of a name that similar to “Delia”.\n\n\n “Something like ‘Delia’… What do you think about ‘Deta’ or ‘Dirk’?”\n\n\n “Deta… or Dirk… I like ‘Dirk’ better!” Delia chirped with a happy blush.\n\n\n “Hello Dirk, I’m your big sister,” she greeted Dirk and stretched out to pat his head. He gave an awkward grin when she did so.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, did you see that?! He’s smiling!”\n\n\n “…That’s amazing Delia. Kamil always cries whenever I carry him,” I replied, a little jealous that Delia was already a better-like older sister than me.\n\n\n I was very determined to win more big sister points, so I would rush to look after Kamil whenever I got home, but with Mum and Tuuli around, I could barely help out. What made it worse was that I couldn’t grasp the technique of changing his diapers. Whenever I tried to help out, Kamil would pee out and that was havoc.\n\n\n “Oh, the orphanage is looking after an abandoned baby? It must be tough since you don’t have an experienced lady to help out,” Mum said while breastfeeding Kamil.\n\n\n “Mum, is there any other way for me to help?”\n\n\n “Taking power naps in the day will make it easier on them to feed him at night. First off, you can try making sure those looking after the baby get more sleep in the day.”\n\n\n She was giving us advice based on her experience and wisdom, so there were no protests on my part.\n\n\n “Alright, I’ll get better at changing Dirk’s and Kamil’s diapers so that everyone can get more sleep.”\n\n\n “That would be great. But frankly, I’m not expecting much from you,” Mum gave a cheeky smile.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n When I turned to the temple on the following day, I saw that Fran and Rosina looked extremely sleep-deprived. It must have been hard for them to alter their sleeping schedule and wake up to feed Dirk in the middle of the night. They definitely needed naps.\n\n\n “Fran, Rosina, please take a bell-long nap after having your breakfast. You need more time to rest now that you are going to wake up at night.”\n\n\n “As per orders, thank you Sister Myne,” Fran and Rosina gave their thanks.\n\n\n It was already tough on mothers to raise children, so I can’t imagine it will be any easier for anyone else to look after a baby that had appeared in the orphanage out of the blue.\n\n\n “Anyways, Sister Myne, there’s something off about Dirk,” Delia looked at Dirk with lots of concern in her gaze. But he seemed perfectly fine to me, he was just snoozing away.\n\n\n “This morning, Dirk started crying and we couldn’t pacify him because we hadn’t prepared the milk. His head started heating up and some bubbles appeared on his cheeks. He went back to normal when he got his milk though. Anyways, we have no clue what’s wrong with him,” Fran explained to me whatever he saw. I was confused because he looked perfectly fine to me now.\n\n\n “We’ll have to make him a little hungry and cry. It’s tough for me to make a judgement without seeing it in person. Unfortunately, we don’t have anyone here to tell us if this is normal among babies.”\n\n\n We waited for Dirk to start crying from hunger. And just as told, he started burning up as his wails got louder.\n\n\n “Look, Sister Myne, he’s burning up.”\n\n\n I placed my palm onto his forehead but was jolted away by what felt like a volt of electricity. Dirk started crying harder when that happened.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, his cheeks are bubbling again.”\n\n\n “Delia, quick, give him his milk.”\n\n\n “Yes. Here’s your milk Dirk,” Delia slowly lifted a spoonful of milk into his mouth.\n\n\n Dirk stopped crying when he felt the milk in his mouth. He started taking small sips, and his cheeks and fever quickly settled down. I didn’t feel that spark of energy again when I touched him.\n\n\n “Fran, send a request for a meeting with the High Priest now. It is an urgent one,” I ordered seriously.\n\n\n He rushed out of the chamber while Delia looked at me with trepidation, “Sister Myne, what’s going on?”\n\n\n “I am not too sure about this, and I do not want to make it worse for you by making wild guesses,” I looked down and shook my head.\n\n\n I prayed that whatever I was thinking was wrong, but it was unlikely. Dirk had the Devouring. What was more devastating was that his mana was strong enough to kill him.\n\n\n Delia narrowed her eyes in worry upon hearing the uncertainty in my voice, and she hugged Dirk closer to her body"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Dirk was at risk of dying anytime if his Devouring was severe, he would need a mana tool to absorb his mana. I wanted to do the most I could for him to survive.\n\n\n “Lutz, can you help me with something? I need you to get some tauw fruits from the forest. They can be stored in the soil area of the workshop’s basement, right?”\n\n\n I asked for Lutz, who was in the workshop, to come to the second floor of my chambers. I whispered my request to him because I didn’t think it would be wise for a noble like Damuel to learn about tauw fruits.\n\n\n I gestured towards Dirk with my gaze, Lutz gave a slight nod to my request and quickly left for the forest. He sort of understood the circumstances from my expression. We could prevent Dirk from dying from a mana outburst if Lutz returned with them.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, the High Priest has approved the meeting.”\n\n\n Fran rushed back panting. Apparently Arno and the High Priest didn’t seem pleased at having to have two sudden meetings on consecutive days, but they couldn’t turn a blind eye to it. I needed the High Priest to determine if Dirk really had the Devouring and his current state so we could take premeditated action.\n\n\n “I don’t think we can hand Dirk over to Wilma today. We have to bring him to the High Priest’s chambers. Fran, please carry him.”\n\n\n I wanted to bring Dirk along since he was the subject of concern, but Delia clinged onto him protectively and Fran shook his head at what I said.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, we are not allowed to take a orphan who has not been baptized outside the orphanage.”\n\n\n My chambers were still considered a part of the orphanage because it was still in the same building, but it differed for the High Priest’s chambers. It had completely slipped my mind that bringing the children to the forest was supposed to be kept confidential. It had only occurred to me that the children had been kept in the orphanage so that the blue priests did not have to see them.\n\n\n “…I intended to bring Dirk along because I thought it would be better, but I guess that is not a good idea.”\n\n\n Like always, Fran and Damuel accompanied me to the High Priest’s chambers. When we entered, we were greeted by the High Priest’s annoyed questioning, “What’s going on now?”\n\n\n “I would like to discuss a very important matter. Will it be fine to discuss it here?”\n\n\n I muttered out the last part and gestured towards the hidden room with my eyes. The High Priest gave a perplexed look before taking out the sound-blocking tool. I took it into my hand.\n\n\n “Is this matter that serious that you have to be this cautious of your surroundings?”\n\n\n “…Yes, that’s right. It’s Dirk, the baby from the other day, he might have the Devouring.”\n\n\n I recounted what I saw that morning, and the High Priest responded with a troubled sigh,\n\n\n “The severity of the situation would depend on the amount of mana he possesses. But based on the symptoms you have described, he likely has quite an amount.”\n\n\n “So he really has the Devouring?”\n\n\n “Yes.”\n\n\n The High Priest nodded with a grim face and tapped against his temple with his finger.\n\n\n “He will need to enter a contractual relationship with a noble, the earlier the better.”\n\n\n “A contract…”\n\n\n “He won’t live long if he doesn’t do so.”\n\n\n I clenched onto the mana tool. Signing a contract with a noble meant that your life would be in their hands. Your life depended on their mana tools, and in return, you had to work for them like a slave. You would basically become a living mana generator for the noble for the rest of your life. The very thought of Dirk, who was close in age to my baby brother, having to go through that, sent a shiver down my spine.\n\n\n “High Priest, is it possible to make him into a blue robe priest and offer mana like me? Or perhaps find him a noble adoptive parent?”\n\n\n “Raising a blue priest from infancy to adulthood will require a hefty sum. Who will be willing to do that?”\n\n\n As a fellow blue shrine maiden, I was more than clear on how expensive it was to live like one. Even with the income from the Myne workshop, I was near bankruptcy having to prepare my things for the winter. Everything from clothes, shoes, etcetera was exorbitant.\n\n\n “You could get by as a blue shrine maiden because you have a workshop on the side, but would that be possible for a baby orphan?” the High Priest lectured.\n\n\n “…No.”\n\n\n “Or are you intending to raise him alongside yourself? Would you spend that much for a baby with no blood ties with you? Will your family accept that? Even if you could, wouldn’t others accuse you, the orphanage director, for being biased towards an orphan?”\n\n\n I didn’t tarry at that. Forget about being in trouble for showing favoritism to an orphan, I didn’t think it was even possible for me to cover both our expenses for life. I wanted to help him, but I was helpless and weak. I sat in dismal silence. The High Priest saw my dejected spirit and took an edge of his voice.\n\n\n “To have a noble adopt him will require the archduke’s direct approval. I cannot churn up an adoptive parent for him this sudden. You were a special case because of your sheer mana, exceptional sense for business and knowledge from another world. You were adopted by an archnoble because of your assets to the city,” he explained.\n\n\n He basically told me that strings were pulled behind the scenes for me to get adopted by Karstedt. The High Priest had put himself in a risky position for me.\n\n\n “Myne, the baby is a boy, right?”\n\n\n “Yes.”\n\n\n Oh yes, we didn’t know the baby’s gender when I last spoke to the High Priest. He figured out his gender because I addressed him with ‘he’.\n\n\n “That makes the situation much more tricky…” he shook his head slowly.\n\n\n “I have told you before that a child’s mana potential is dependent on the maternal side of the family. A female baby is more likely to be adopted, the noble will try to label them as their real child and marry them into a political marriage as a pawn.”\n\n\n I nibbled on my lower lip. Most of my memories were that of Urano, so I didn’t look favourably upon things like being forced into a political marriage and slave-like contracts.\n\n\n “Given the mana shortage, a noble might choose to adopt him, but I cannot determine his chances until I know exactly how much mana he possesses. Well then… How about tomorrow’s third bell? I will visit your chambers with a mana measuring tool. Would that be fine?”\n\n\n “Yes, please.” I gave my reply and returned the sound-blocking tool back. But the High Priest pushed it back into my hand.\n\n\n I was confused why he did that, perhaps he wanted to speak about something else.\n\n\n “Myne, does anyone else know about this baby’s Devouring?”\n\n\n I dug through my memories. I was sure that none of my attendants were well-versed about the Devouring. Even Fran could not recognise that Dirk’s symptoms were that of the Devouring. Lutz probably made a wild guess since I had asked for some tauw fruits while looking towards Dirk. Anyways, I was confident that my attendants were unaware of it.\n\n\n “I believe that I am the only one who has fully realised that Dirk keeps burning up because of his Devouring.”\n\n\n “Well then, keep this to yourself. Take extra caution to hide this from the High Bishop.”\n\n\n “Yes…”\n\n\n That would mean I couldn’t tell Delia that Dirk had the Devouring (she couldn’t inform the High Bishop if she remains in the dark). I didn’t feel comfortable hiding things from Delia, especially since she cared for him so much and truly wanted to be the best sister for him."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Next day, on the chime of the third bell, the High Priest came to my chambers, accompanied by Arno. Since we knew they were visiting, we had well-fed Dirk and changed his diapers beforehand. Well… he does dirty his diapers whenever we change them, but we couldn’t do anything about that.\n\n\n But there was something special about Dirk, he rarely cried. As long as he had clean diapers and was well-fed, he would always have a cheerful smile. He was easy to put to sleep and was generally easier to care for than most babies, which everyone was thankful for. Kamil was completely different, he loved to cry. He was very fussy whenever he was sleepy, and needed Mum to rock him to sleep in her arms. I didn’t know if their difference was due to their age difference, or if it was because they had dissimilar personalities.\n\n\n Right now, Dirk was in my room, napping on a small mattress we made from straw-stuffings. Delia sat next to him, watching over him as he slept. This tiny mattress was Dirk’s bed and was compact so we could easily move him to the first floor whenever it was Fran’s turn to look after him. After that, he would be moved to the second floor, into Rosina and Delia’s rooms respectively.\n\n\n I heard a creak at the front door and Fran’s voice, “Good morning, High Priest.”\n\n\n “Where is the child?”\n\n\n “He is upstairs, I will guide you there.”\n\n\n Delia seemed to have realised that the High Priest had arrived because her face hardened and she frowned at the staircase. I saw the High Priest as someone I could rely on whenever I was in trouble or in need, but Delia would beg to differ.\n\n\n “Thank you for coming here.”\n\n\n “Myne, have everyone step down.”\n\n\n Arno placed a magic tool onto the table, crossed his arms and moved away. The tool was a circlet with small mana stones embedded onto it, it resembled a divine instrument.\n\n\n “Everyone, please leave the room.\n\n\n I had everyone leave the room. But Delia tooked reluctant to do so as she kept her gaze onto Dirk as she slowly made her way down the stairs. With everyone gone, the High Priest passed me the sound-blocking mana tool.\n\n\n “Having everyone step down is insufficient, we will need extra reassurance to make sure we are not heard from downstairs,” he explained.\n\n\n I nodded my head and took the sound-blocking tool. I walked towards Dirk while the High Priest followed behind with the magic tool that measures mana. He placed the circlet on his head and it shrunk down to perfectly wrap his head. This small event didn’t surprise me anymore.\n\n\n “Oh, their colours are changing.”\n\n\n I was more than familiar with how mana stones changed colour whenever you sent mana into it. Apparently this method was used amongst noble children to measure the amount of mana they had at birth. The stones slowly stopped changing colour and the High Priest proceeded to remove it and count how many of them had their colours changed.\n\n\n “Hmm. It would seem that his mana is comparable to a higher-ranking midnoble.”\n\n\n “…A midnoble? I actually thought he had more mana than me.”\n\n\n Myne survived till five years old with the Devouring, so I had assumed that Dirk’s Devouring was much more severe since he was already in a life-threatening state, but that wasn’t so.\n\n\n “A baby is easily influenced by its own emotions, so it cannot compare to a girl who can repress her mana with sheer mental strength. Furthermore, you have been controlling your mana without any help before, right?”\n\n\n The High Priest enlightened me as to how people with control over their mana could better suppress their mana in their body. He hypothesized that Myne’s mana was strong enough to consume her when she was five. Dirk was probably born with more mana. Only when I took over her body did her mana get compressed down, which allowed more room for growth. Everytime the mana attempted to take over my body, I pushed it deeper down in me, allowing for more growth everytime. I had did this so many times that I now possessed a ridiculous amount of mana.\n\n\n The High Priest continued to explain that the amount of mana I stored in my body was beyond human comprehension. In fact, compressing mana was something only nobles were trained to do in the Royal Academy before they reached adulthood…\n\n\n “Wait, so every noble can increase their mana capacity if they start training at a younger age?”\n\n\n “Stop trying to make it look easier, you bonehead. Having your mana reach its capacity before compressing it with sheer mental force is playing with death itself. You’re more than familiar with that, am I right?”\n\n\n “Yes, you are.”\n\n\n I couldn’t recall how many times I had struggled to push the mana back into my body. As a result, my mana capacity had grown tremendously. It took me a year and a half before I entered the temple as Myne, and I had spent every day playing with death.\n\n\n “It is not an easy feat to compress one’s mana if they do not have sufficient mental strength. So of course nobles would wait for their children to reach of age before they teach them how, right? There have been countless students every year who fail to control their mana and end up in life-threatening situations.”\n\n\n Being so close to death was already part of my daily life, but nobles were different because they were given magic tools from birth to help them with this. They only needed to transfer their mana into these tools and they would continue to do so until they learned how to control it in the Royal Academy. Blue priests never got to go to the Royal Academy, so they didn’t know how to control or increase their mana, they pretty much spent their entire lives offering their mana.\n\n\n “Well, you’re an exception. Some nobles might be willing to adopt a child with lots of mana due to the current mana shortage situation. However, your safety is our utmost concern, so it would be dangerous if others were to learn that we are trying to find an adoptive family for a child with the Devouring.”\n\n\n If adoption wasn’t an option, I would prefer that Dirk signs a contract with someone who would take good care of him. I firmed my gaze towards the High Priest.\n\n\n “H-high Priest, would you offer a contract to Dirk?”\n\n\n “I am capable of doing so, but will not. I have no need for such mana.”\n\n\n The High Priest explained only nobles that lacked mana would offer a contract to a Devouring child. They needed this mana to manage their land and to activate their magic tools. They wanted to keep his contract hidden, so better cared for children would become servants or concubines-to-be, and mistreated ones would be locked away in the basements… So that was why the guildmaster spent an arm and leg making sure that Freida received noble-training. I bowed my head down in sadness, I was worried about Dirk’s future. The High Priest noticed this and sighed.\n\n\n “I can tell you greatly care for him. You can offer him a contract after your adoption by Karstedt.”\n\n\n “…Me?” I was completely stunned. I didn’t think that I could enter a contract with Dirk after I received my noble title.\n\n\n “You will receive the authority to do so when your adoption has gone through. You can keep his Devouring a secret and raise him carefully in the orphanage in the meantime.”\n\n\n “That’s great, thank you.”\n\n\n If I was going to offer Dirk a contract, no one could accuse me of being biased towards a single orphan. But I would still have to receive the High Priest’s and Karstedt’s permission in doing so (especially Karstedt because he was going to become my adoptive father). I only needed to keep his Devouring condition hidden until then. His future was looking much better now.\n\n\n I was overjoyed at this. The High Priest frowned at me though, seemingly annoyed.\n\n\n “Myne, do not get careless. The High Bishop will definitely do something if he were to discover that this baby has the Devouring. You are able to tarry his attacks, but a baby cannot do so. He will take actions to acquire him. To keep him safe, you must do well to keep his secret hidden.”\n\n\n It was not out of the picture for the High Bishop to exploit Dirk for himself. If the High Bishop demanded that I had him over, I was powerless to stop him.\n\n\n “Always keep this in mind, you future and safety in the temple depends on how well you can protect this baby.”\n\n\n “Ok, I understand.”\n\n\n The High Priest reassured me that Dirk’s mana would be suppressed for now because the mana measuring tool had absorbed some of it. He made his way out my chambers after that. After that Delia quickly rushed back to the second floor.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, what did the High Priest say?! Will Dirk be fine?”\n\n\n “He will be fine,” I continued on while shaking my head, “The High Priest said that we can continue looking after him.”\n\n\n “Ha… Thank goodness.”\n\n\n Delia’s shoulders slackened and she picked up Dirk, hugging him close to her body. Seeing this further entrenched in me the thought that I couldn’t let anyone else adopt Dirk, or enter a contract with him.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, I am here to pick up Dirk.” a voice rang out.\n\n\n “Thank you, Wilma.”\n\n\n Fran and Rosina usually took their breaks in the afternoon, they were always anxious around Dirk, so we thought it would be better for him to return to the orphanage. Delia looked depressed seeing Dirk leave with Wilma.\n\n\n “Delia, you are more than welcome to follow him to the orphanage.”\n\n\n “But Fran and Rosina aren’t here right now, and Gil is at the workshop. You would not have any attendants to tend to you if I am not around, Sister Myne.” Delia glared daggers at me when I suggested that.\n\n\n “I have no qualms tagging along.”\n\n\n “Sister Myne, I am sure you know that I do not wish to return to the orphanage ever again,” she shot me down immediately.\n\n\n “Yes, I am aware,” I gave a nonchalant reply and walked back to my desk.\n\n\n It was surely not a wise decision to leave my chambers without Fran or Rosina, so I thought that I should focus on thinking of a new black and white picture book for Dirk. Dirk was much older than Kamil. He was already old enough to start rolling over by himself soon, so he could see and recognize pictures soon.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, I wonder what Dirk is doing right now.”\n\n\n “He’s probably sleeping.”\n\n\n I used a pen and ink to draw some images consisting of circles and triangles on a blank piece of paper. After that, I would only need some of the hide glue we made over the winter to attack the paper onto a board. I had to wait for Fran to return from his break and ask him to get me some hide glue. Dad could punch some holes into the boards and tie them up with a string. After that, the book would be completed.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, is Dirk crying now, or maybe he’s feeling lonely?”\n\n\n “I doubt he would be lonely with the children around, but he might find it difficult to sleep with all that noise.”\n\n\n “But he needs to sleep!”\n\n\n “There’s no point telling me this. Frankly, I do not know if it is actually noisy there,” I continued to reply nonchalantly and focused on making my to-do list in my diptych.\n\n\n Number one, I needed to order as many types of wax available from the wax workshop. Mimeograph stencils were usually made from a combination of resin and wax, which also made them much stronger. This time I was only going to use wax to roll out the letter. How great would it be if that worked out?\n\n\n “Sister Myne, are you not worried about Dirk?”\n\n\n “Nope, I trust that Wilma will take good care of him.”\n\n\n Secondly, I needed to consult someone from an ink workshop about the idea of making coloured ink. The orphanage didn’t have anything good for making it, the workshop might have a better idea on that.\n\n\n “You can’t just assume that. Urgh! Sister Myne, are you even paying attention to me?” Delia erupted because I was so monotonous with my responses.\n\n\n I broke away from my diptych and sighed in annoyance.\n\n\n “I can tell that you’re worried about him, why don’t you head down and check it out yourself. Wilma will be glad to welcome you.”\n\n\n “…But I don’t want to be in the orphanage.” Delia bit her lip.\n\n\n I could clearly tell she was torn between wanting to go and not.\n\n\n “If that’s so, I can check on him on your behalf.”\n\n\n “T-That’s so unfair!”\n\n\n Delia tugged on my sleeve, and that sent me giggling. I said that because I knew she would fine it unsightly for me to leave my chambers without an attendant, and it would appear that she fell for the trap.\n\n\n “Then, will you accompany me Delia?”\n\n\n Delia’s pupils trembled and she shook her head, which sent her red hair swishing about. She looked back at me with tear-filled eyes and nibbled on her lip again.\n\n\n “…I don’t want to.”\n\n\n I returned a shrug and went back to my diptych, I wasn’t going to tease her anymore. Delia remained silent after that. She kept walking back and forth from the room. It was a little cute to see her this troubled, but I knew that she was inevitably going to give in and run to the orphanage."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Myne, Sir Benno wants to know when you will be free,” said Lutz.\n\n\n It had been ten days since Kamil’s birth and the Gilberta Company had requested to meet me. Benno had probably found a wax workshop that could fulfill be requests (or more like that was the only reason I could think of why he would want to see me).\n\n\n “He has arranged a meeting with the wax workshop, right? We should probably meet two days later in the morning, that way Fran can accompany me.”\n\n\n “Nope, it’s not that. Someone else wants to meet you.”\n\n\n “…Huh? That’s a shame.”\n\n\n My excitement was immediately extinguished. I was looking forward to finding a wax workshop, but it didn’t seem to be happening anytime soon. I did agree to meet them, with some disappointment though.\n\n\n “It might be better to get Gil to come along instead of Fran. Sir Benno said that it’s a craftsman from an ink workshop who wants to meet you.”\n\n\n My excitement was revived with those words. I was looking for an ink workshop to talk about making a new type of ink, in hopes that they would be interested in making coloued ink.\n\n\n “Hehehehe. I’m so excited, Lutz.”\n\n\n “You sure are easy to please.”\n\n\n Lutz sighed, and that made me remember something. The late head of the Ink Guild had been trying to gather information about me. There was a chance that his successor was doing the same too.\n\n\n “…Actually, will it be fine for me to meet someone from the Ink Guild?” I asked with sweat in my palms\n\n\n Lutz looked at me, deep in thought and said, “If Mister Benno says so, it should be fine.”\n\n\n “Alright then. I’m looking forward to it.”\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n On that fateful morning, Lutz came to the temple and we walked to the Gilberta Company with Damuel and Gil. Mark was probably flooded with work, but nevertheless, he still came out to welcome us.\n\n\n “Good morning Lady Myne. Everyone is waiting inside.”\n\n\n “Good morning, Mark. I thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to welcome us, would you kindly take us to them?”\n\n\n Mark responded with his usual gentle smile and walked us to Benno’s office. We were greeted by someone I recognised and another who I didn’t. As always, the ink workshop foreman had on his usual frowning face and upright posture. As for the other lady, she was someone who had come of age because her bronze hair had been braided and tied up in a bun. She looked quite unkempt, so I guess appearance didn’t matter much to her. Her grey eyes sparkled with curiosity, which made her quite child-like.\n\n\n “Dad, dad. Is that the girl?”\n\n\n “She’s a rich lady. Don’t be rude.”\n\n\n It turns out that they were father and daughter. He lectured her in a serious voice, and that stopped her from pointing at me. But she still looked at me with those eyes burning with with curiosity.\n\n\n “Good morning, Miss Myne.”\n\n\n Benno greeted me and gestured me to sit on the spot next to him. I gave him a nod and glanced at Damuel, he stepped forward and lead me to my seat and placed me on it with poise. He was amazing as always.\n\n\n “Name’s Bierce. After Wolf’s death, I am now the new leader of the Ink Guild. I had no intentions of taking up this position, but now that I have, I want to do the most for the Guild,” the foreman explained the Ink Guild’s current situation, rubbing his forehead with a troubled expression.\n\n\n How Wolf had died was still a mystery, as such no foreman in the city was willing to succeed in his position. Instead, they all pushed the responsibility around until it reached Bierce, who had no choice but to accept it.\n\n\n My condolences.\n\n\n “I am not one to talk bad about the dead, but Wolf… really shouldn’t have done all the things he did,” Bierce dipped his head. He looked really troubled by having the clean up after Wolf, which he had to take full responsibility for now. He continued mumbling, even though he was quite a quiet man.\n\n\n “I want to make sure that all the workshops can continue working together. But as you can see, I’m not exactly great at talking. I’m not a businessman type of guy.”\n\n\n In the normal line of work, ink workshops just focused on making their trade of work, and the pitching of sales was done by merchants from the Merchant’s Guild or other related stores. However, Wolf had manipulated the market such that there was only one ink store in the lower city, doing so would allow him to monopolise the trade with the nobles.\n\n\n “The craftsman had no issue with how their ink was sold, but not the nobles. There’s no way a shabby man like me who was running the ink store can now easily talk to the nobles right now, right?”\n\n\n Business with nobles was surely profitable, but it came with its own detriments too. From the way I saw things, Benno seemed fine doing business with the nobles, but his nerves were a wreck whenever he had to meet Sylvester or the High Priest. And their meetings would always be followed by more stress-inducing tasks. That was expected, even messing up a greeting with a noble could ruin all your business connections.\n\n\n It will be absolutely cruel to demand a store that had only been doing business with the richer commoners in the lower city to now handle talks with the nobles. It was expected that a store owner, along with his apprentices and workers, would not know how to approach them. Not only did they not know how to greet nobles, they had to succeed in the position from someone who had an odd death. This situation was absurd.\n\n\n …No one wanted to be involved with nobles.\n\n\n Frankly, there were multiple stores in the city who had connections with nobles. Their numbers were already barely a handful, and it got even less if you narrow it down to those who knew how to manage business talks about ink.\n\n\n “The guildmaster’s store does do business with nobles, right? Why don’t you try asking him for help?” Benno had raised his eyebrow.\n\n\n Seeing how he had brought up the guildmaster instead of trying to sell the ink himself meant that the ink business wasn’t a very lucrative one, that it had its own problems or that it wasn’t a sector Benno thought was worth investing in. Bierce must have thought that Benno would be interested in this business, but now that it didn’t seem so, his shoulders dropped down and he shook his head.\n\n\n “If only that was possible. The guildmaster had a hand in this business before, but Wolf had snatched it away the moment he took charge of the Ink Guild. You already know what will happen if I go there now.\n\n\n Benno frowned, he could already predict how the guildmaster would act.\n\n\n “He will try to extort as much money as possible from you. I can already see his nasty smirk from here.”\n\n\n “That’s right. So I had no choice but to approach you.”\n\n\n Now that the Gilberta Company was selling books from the Myne Workshop, it wouldn’t be weird for them to sell ink too. Furthermore, the Myne Workshop was the one who invented ink and would surely order lots of them. However Benno shot it down.\n\n\n “That’s not possible. There will surely be lots of nobles approaching me to do the nasty stuff Wolf had been doing for them. Additionally, the guildmaster is going to crack down on me more if I start selling ink too.”\n\n\n I turned towards Benno.\n\n\n “So you will let someone else handle this business instead?”\n\n\n I could understand where Benno was coming from, but having someone else handle the selling of ink would mean I’d have to come into contact with them too. Frankly, it’s going to be a pain in the head having them not judge me for my appearance, and that will definitely delay us from getting the real work done.\n\n\n “We’re going to need lots of ink when we start printing in the Myne Workshop. To be honest, I prefer doing business with you over anyone else, Benno.”\n\n\n “Hear that, Benno? Even the girl agrees too.”\n\n\n “Hmm… But still…” Benno was still reluctant about it, but he was less impervious about it. Bierce seemed to have realised that too, so he pleaded at me.\n\n\n “Could you give him another push, girl?”\n\n\n “…Sure, I don’t mind, but under the condition if you help me make coloured ink.”\n\n\n “Coloured ink? What do you mean?”\n\n\n Bierce was utterly bamboozled, but the lady next to him raised her hand high up.\n\n\n “Let me do it! That’s why I came here!”\n\n\n “Uh… Pardon me, but what is your name?”\n\n\n “This is Heidi. She’s my daughter and she will be taking over my workshop in future. She loves developing ink and making new things. She’s still this childish even though she’s already twenty. Both she and her husband have been making all that ink you invented for your paper.”\n\n\n Looks can be deceiving, she looked around fifteen, but in reality she was in her twenties and married.\n\n\n Amazing.\n\n\n “Your ink was such a curious discovery, it really blew my mind. Nice to meet cha.”\n\n\n “My name is Myne. I can already tell that we are going to do some amazing things together.”\n\n\n “Your workshop is the only one but the ink for plant paper. So continue buying more, alright?”\n\n\n The real issue with the ink here was that it soaked into the plant paper to some extent. The ink didn’t cause much problems, so people could continue using them even if they bought the slightly cheaper plant paper. They didn’t have to spend more money to buy a different type of ink. Above all, the ink I had the Ink Guild made was a thicker type meant for printing, I was pretty sure I was the only one interested in buying them.\n\n\n “Well then, I should speed up on making the second picture book.”\n\n\n “Oh yes, I figured this out when making the ink for plant paper, but you can probably make coloured ink with this too.”\n\n\n It turns out that Heidi had thought of making coloured ink too, but when it came to developing it, her hands were tied. Bierce had told her that the Ink Guild had entered a special magic contract with the Gilberta Company to obtain exclusive rights to the black ink, and that the contract might have included coloured ink too. But Heidi was so desperate to make her own coloured ink that she begged him to talk to Benno. Benno was absolutely clueless about ink, so that’s how it ended up with a meeting with me.\n\n\n “You can make coloured ink. Feel free to go ahead and make as many of them as you like.”\n\n\n “Uh… but what materials should I use? I was hoping that you might have some suggestions. I gathered the ingredients used in paint and dyes, what do you suppose would go well with the ink?” Heidi asked me with eyes sparkling with joy.\n\n\n I opened my mouth and was about to answer, but stopped when Benno dropped his hand onto my shoulder.\n\n\n “Myne. You should know better, hm?”\n\n\n He was basically telling me with his eyes: Stop giving information for free.\n\n\n I quickly closed my mouth and nodded back at Benno. I turned back to Heidi\n\n\n “In exchange for my information, I want ten percent of the revenue generated from the coloured ink.”\n\n\n “That’s going too far! Developing and making the stuff before it hits the shelves is already going to cost us an arm and leg!” Heidi jerked out of her chair screaming. It turns out she was very well familiar with the costs of developing and making new ink.\n\n\n I crossed my arms and reconsidered it.\n\n\n “Well then, I will still take ten percent of the revenue but I will help pay for half of amount it takes to develop the ink.”\n\n\n “Great! I look forward to working with you!”\n\n\n Heidi shot out her hand, her face beaming.\n\n\n Mission complete.\n\n\n But before I could return her handshake, Benno grabbed my head and Bierce slapped Heidi’s hand.\n\n\n “Stop making decisions by yourself!”\n\n\n We both looked at our own mentors and grabbed our heads.\n\n\n “…What’s wrong? Wasn’t that a fair trade?”\n\n\n “No way. You were so generous that it was almost stupid. Since you’re going to provide them with information, covering a quarter of the research is more than enough.”\n\n\n “That’s right, that would be better.”\n\n\n Bierce agreed with Benno’s lecturing. After that, the two resumed the business talk by themselves. I wanted to continue discussing with Heidi about how we could start developing the ink, and judging by how she was shifting around her seat with a pleading gaze at me, she shared the same sentiments as me."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Miss, would you like to come to my workshop? I’ve already laid out all the materials I wanted to show you. Dad wasn’t happy about that though.”\n\n\n “Yes, please! I would love to come!”\n\n\n I knew that Heidi and I already shared a special connection. We both got up from our chairs at the same time, but our own mentors pulled us back down.\n\n\n “We are still talking!”\n\n\n “Hold on, you blockhead!”\n\n\n Our guardians yelled out simultaneously. Benno was still gripping me and left out a deep sigh.\n\n\n “…Fine, I will take charge of selling the ink. We will only resume monopoly over the ink for Myne Workshop’s plant paper, as well as the coloured ink. We will let others take whatever else is left. That should keep the guildmaster distracted.”\n\n\n “Sounds fine. I appreciate it, thanks for everything.”\n\n\n That marked the end of Benno and Bierce’s endless discussion, we had finally decided on the new seller.\n\n\n “I can go to the workshop now, right?”\n\n\n “We need to start making that ink.”\n\n\n Heidi and I exclaimed, and Benno beckoned Lutz over and patted him on the back.\n\n\n “Watch over them, Lutz. Looks like we have two Mynes now.”\n\n\n “Mister Benno, you’re asking too much. One Myne is already enough for me.”\n\n\n Benno’s expression turned into that of worry, but I just brushed it off with a wave goodbye and made my way down to the ink shop. Of course, Heidi got impatient at the speed I was walking and ran off first so that she could set up the materials first.\n\n\n Bierce was worried that her actions offended me and apologised in her stead. But I didn’t mind it at all.\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz. What’s your thoughts on Heidi? I find her funny and talented, but she’s also kind of odd too.”\n\n\n “…The pot’s calling the kettle black.”\n\n\n Bierce led us into the workshop which looked more like a science lab you would find it schools, it didn’t look like a place to make ink. The place was packed with lots of tools and the craftsmen were using scales to measure out the amount of ingredients they would need to make ink. The ink for plant paper was made in another corner of the place.\n\n\n I noticed there were already a couple of containers filled with ink, and behind all that was Heidi getting reprimanded by a man who seemed to be in his twenties. He was pretty much telling her to ‘work first, play later.”\n\n\n “Bierce, does Heidi need to work on something else?”\n\n\n “…No, you don’t have to worry about that. Hey, Joseph! Stop scolding Heidi, she’s receiving a customer today,” Bierce yelled at him across the room.\n\n\n Heidi whipped her head around with a cheerful grin, but the guy who was supposedly Joseph was stumped.\n\n\n “Boss, are you right in the mind?! You’re letting Heidi receive a customer?”\n\n\n “This lady is an important customer who wishes to develop coloured ink and would like to pay for a quarter of the research’s cost. There’s no need to force Heidi to stop her research. We can let her do as she pleases as long as she doesn’t cause trouble.”\n\n\n The words they exchanged told me how the others saw Heidi.\n\n\n “Lady Myne, please meet Joseph. He’s Heidi’s husband and the future head of this workshop. It will be great to have the both of you working together.”\n\n\n “Hi, I’m Myne, the head of the Myne Workshop. I would like to buy the plant paper ink and help out with making coloured ink,” I Introduced myself.\n\n\n Joseph sighed in relief at my presence, he seemed to be worried about the poor sales for the plant paper ink.\n\n\n “This is everything we have made for now.”\n\n\n “Please deliver them to our store by tomorrow,” Lutz said.\n\n\n He was here to buy the ink on behalf of the Gilberta Company, after which it would be sold to the Myne Workshop. This seemed like a troublesome process, but it was a necessary one.\n\n\n I left Lutz to his own devices and went to look around the workshop. Samuel and Gil had tagged along to and seemed intrigued by the place too, they wanted to know more about life in the lower city.\n\n\n “Lady Myne, please come here.”\n\n\n I made my way over to Heidi and noticed that the table was lined with an array of materials. They have been crushed into a powder form, so I didn’t know what they were. I also noticed that there were different types of oil too.\n\n\n “Heidi, what oils are these?”\n\n\n “I tried to gather as much as I could find. Linseed oil might not be the best one after all, right?”\n\n\n “Yeah, I had the same idea too.”\n\n\n One crucial factor for making ink was the drying oil, but the closest thing to that available here was only linseed oil. I came to know of its existence when I saw the clothes in this world. Clothes were made from the same plant, in this case the oil was extracted from its seeds. However, linseed oil was expensive because of its limited supply. I wanted to find alternatives to it, so it would be good for me to know the various types of oils that existed in this world first.\n\n\n “There are some oils that become solid when left out, while others don’t. The former are great for making ink. They are called drying oil,” I explained.\n\n\n “Hm, only a few oils are like linseed oil. Misse, bedgam, ise and term oil,” Heidi grabbed the respective oils as she listed them out.\n\n\n I quickly took out my diptych to scribble down all the oils she mentioned.\n\n\n “I usually make ink by crushing the ingredients first, after that I’ll add in the oils. Here we go… this yellow powder should make an ink close to yellow and brown.”\n\n\n “Alright, we’ll try it out. Joseph, help us a little.”\n\n\n Heidi gestured towards Joseph and he came over to mix the oil and powder on top of the stone workbench.\n\n\n “…Huh? The colour is different!”\n\n\n “W-why though?”\n\n\n This yellow clay should have made a yellow-brown ink when mixed with the oil. But it had turned into a completely different colour, that was a light sky blue. I was completely bamboozled by this.\n\n\n “W-we can try another oil first.”\n\n\n Joseph and Heidi continued to mix the powder with the different types of oil. First was misse, then bedgam, and ise, finishing off with term. Only ise had made the yellow ink I was expecting, the others had made ink of red and a green-blue one. My mind froze at this. We just stared at the different colours on the table in silence.\n\n\n “What’s going on?”\n\n\n “I wasn’t expecting the oil to drastically change the ink’s colour. It was definitely a shock, but I guess there’s nothing wrong with being able to make this many colours with the same ingredient, huh.”\n\n\n Joseph was rubbing his sore shoulders and looked back at me with exhaustion on his face.\n\n\n “Didn’t expect you to be this optimistic.”\n\n\n “Well, we are trying to make coloured ink, I’ll be happy with everything we get as long as it isn’t transparent.”\n\n\n I recorded our observations on my diptych, hoping to figure out a clue to this absurdity. On the other hand, Lutz was looking at the ink with a hand to his face.\n\n\n “What’s going on? How did you even get these results?”\n\n\n “Are you interested? It’s such a strange thing, right? Don’t you want to know why too?!” Heidi cheered and gathered Lutz’s hands into hers. She had the smile of a mad scientist. She was someone who was interested in uncovering anything that interested her.\n\n\n I slammed my diptych close.\n\n\n “Heidi, we don’t need to know what’s going on with these ink right now. We should focus on figuring out what colours we can make from mixing them around.”\n\n\n “What?! Such an interesting thing is unfolding before your eyes, and you’re not even a tiny-winy bit interested in finding out why?”\n\n\n Heidi turned her gray eyes towards me, her gaze was mixed with shock and betrayal. Then Joseph reached out to grab her head.\n\n\n “Stop it! Lady Myne isn’t crazy like you!”\n\n\n “Crazy? That’s rude, man. Here I was thinking we would make great comrades.”\n\n\n I could understand where Heid was coming from, but I didn’t have the time to get sidetracked right now. My priority was to get coloured picture books for my younger brother, Kamil. Even though I didn’t have the time, I wasn’t going to disregard anyone who wanted to conduct research on this though.\n\n\n “I prioritise the result over the process right now. What’s important is that ise made the colour I wanted. We’ll try using the blue powder with isse now. We might figure out some patterns to develop the colours we are looking for.”\n\n\n I gestured towards the blue powder. Heidi nodded back to me.\n\n\n “You’re right. Let’s continue.”\n\n\n Ise had made the yellow colour I was intending for, but this time it made a bright yellow mixture when mixed with the blue powder that resembled lapis lazuli. This colour was great for painting sunflowers, but it wasn’t the colour I wanted. After mixing around, only linseed oil kept it’s lapis blue.\n\n\n “…We’re going to struggle a bit,” I commented while reviewing our results on my diptych.\n\n\n Everything I knew seemed irrelevant in this world now. With the number of ingredients and oils we have here, we might end up with a never-ending selection of colours.\n\n\n We have a long road ahead of us."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n The edge of a small window was lined with bottles filled with a variety of coloured inks. Each of them was labelled with a small wooden piece that also listed all of its ingredients. Joseph was busy packing them into a short wood box.\n\n\n We didn’t plan on continuing our research because Joseph and Heidi started complaining about arm aches after mixing the ink for hours. It was almost lunchtime, but we had already used up the two diptychs we had brought along. We had used Lutz’s diptych after mine was completely filled with our research.\n\n\n I scanned both of the diptychs.\n\n\n “This is tough, it’s nearly impossible to predict the colours.”\n\n\n “But we did uncover some patterns, right? It’s amazing to see our data this neatly tabulated. It’s such a blessing to have you around because you write so well, Lady Myne! You’re amazing!” Heidi cheered on as she browsed through the diptych.\n\n\n Other than knowing how to read a couple of words and letters pertaining to her profession, she was pretty much illiterate. Before all this, she didn’t know how to tabulate her data and just memorised them.\n\n\n “I feel that you’re much more amazing to be able to remember all these results.”\n\n\n “Sadly, Heidi only has a good memory going for her when it comes to her work. She’s not that impressive,” Joseph let out a deep sigh\n\n\n Lutz looked at me and grinned snarkily.\n\n\n “Myne’s no different. She only works this hard as long as its related to books.”\n\n\n Lutz and Joseph seemed to have formed a camaraderie over this and patted each other to console themselves. It’s great to know someone who can relate to you. It makes things much more enjoyable.\n\n\n “Alright, I’ll finish tidying up all the data in the next two days.\n\n\n “Oh thank goodness. I’m completely useless when it comes to writing, so I’ll leave it up to you.\n\n\n Heidi and I shook each other’s hands and smiled before separating. I wanted to get home as soon as possible so that I could start analyzing our data, but Gil tugged on my sleeve with a pitiful look.\n\n\n “What’s the matter, Gil?”\n\n\n “Sister Myne, I would like a diptych…” Gil whispered with his eyes down.\n\n\n That struck me - I promised Gil that I would give him one if he mastered reading by spring time.\n\n\n “Alright, let’s drop by Johann’s smithy and place an order for you. After that I’ll head back home to wrap up these results.”\n\n\n The ink workshop was just a stone throw away from the smithy as they were both located one Craftman’s Street. Johann probably wouldn’t want to see us right before his break, but we were still going to crash over.\n\n\n “Good morning. Is Johann around?”\n\n\n The foreman looked away from his customer towards us. The moment he saw me, he sucked in a gasp and greeted me with a stiff “Hello” and told us to take a seat.\n\n\n “Wait here, I’ll call Johann,” he said.\n\n\n “Hey, Gutenberg! You have a visitor!”\n\n\n “Pfff!”\n\n\n Lutz and Gil covered their mouths to hold back their laughter. It seemed like Johann was permanently stuck with the nickname “Gutenberg”.\n\n\n “Boss, didn’t I tell you to stop calling me that!”\n\n\n I thought it would be an amazing feat to be called “Gutenberg”, but Johann thought otherwise. He stomped in from the backroom with a large frown on his face.\n\n\n “Good morning, Johann.”\n\n\n “Oh, welcome Lady Myne.”\n\n\n “I apologise for dropping by right before your lunch break. Could I make an order with you?”\n\n\n “…But I’m still busy with your last order,” Johann gave a troubled look.\n\n\n He was still busy making all the letter types I had ordered, but there was no rush to finish it now that the High Priest asked for the launch of the printing press to be postponed. Johann had all the time to finish them.\n\n\n “Please finish this order first. I would like to order a stylus for Gil. The stylus only needs to be like the previous ones.”\n\n\n “No problem!” Johann exclaimed and shot a fist up.\n\n\n “I haven’t made anything but letter pieces… It’s been too long…” he mumbled to himself and I saw tears welling up in his eyes.\n\n\n …Now I’m starting to feel bad. Sorry about that, Johann.\n\n\n Since I was his only patron, all he had been doing was making letter pieces. Furthermore, his foreman and colleagues had been teasing him with his new title “Gutenberg”.\n\n\n Maybe I should give him other things to do once in a while.\n\n\n “I’ll be sending in more orders soon and it won’t be letter pieces.”\n\n\n I needed an iron to flatten out the wax stencils, along with a new stylus plus a slicer for the mimeograph. I needed him to make lots of things, and they were mostly for printing.\n\n\n “I will look forward to making more things other than letter pieces.”\n\n\n Seeing Johann this happy for getting an order for a stylus made me feel kind of bad. However, that wasn’t going to make me change my mind that he was a Gutenberg.\n\n\n After finishing my order for Gil’s stylus, just as we left the smithy, the fourth bell rung to signal that it was noon\n\n\n “Are you heading home now, Myne?”\n\n\n “Yep.”\n\n\n “I’m getting hungry and I need to return to the store soon. I’ll carry you, hurry up.”\n\n\n Lutz crouched down so that I could get on his back. Apparently there would not be much food left if he returned late. I knew that I was holding him back, so I didn’t fight back and got on his back. He got up and sped up towards the square towards the well outside my house.\n\n\n “Just stay in and work on your test results after lunch. I have to drop by the Myne workshop and meet Mister Benno to tell him what went on today. Do not leave the house, alright?”\n\n\n Lutz set me down in the plaza and put his diptych into my hands before immediately running off toward the Gilberta Company. It looked like he really was worried about his lunch. After seeing him off, I turned to look at Damuel and Gil, who were both blinking in surprise.\n\n\n After Lutz had left, I looked back towards Damuel and Gil who looked flabbergasted by what had happened.\n\n\n “Sir Damuel and Gil, I thank you very much for accompanying me. You are free to head back to the temple, I will not be heading out anymore.”\n\n\n “Sure. You will be going back to the temple, right?”\n\n\n “Yes, please. I would like to visit the ink workshop again, but Rosina wouldn’t be happy if I missed harpiel practice again.”\n\n\n I stored Lutz’s diptych into my basket and walked up the stairs back home by myself.\n\n\n “I’m home,” I greeted under my breath as I slowly pushed open the door even though the door hinges didn’t make a squeak.\n\n\n “Welcome home, Myne. You’re early today,” Mum greeted me as I came in. She was probably getting ready to make lunch as she was near the stove.\n\n\n “Hi Mum, how’s Kamil? Is he sleeping? I didn’t wake him up, right?” I asked and peeked at the bedroom.\n\n\n “He’s doing well, don’t worry,” Mum nodded with a gentle smile.\n\n\n I tiptoed to the bedroom to peek at Kamil, after that I placed my basket down and washed my hands to eat lunch with Mum. We were barely halfway done with our meal before Kamil started to wail. Mum wolfed down her food and rushed over to get him.\n\n\n “Sorry Myne, but I need you to help me clean up.”\n\n\n I washed our dishes before sitting down at the table. I began to transfer our data from our experiments onto my notebook that was made from a stack of failed paper. The data made more sense once I neatened them up. Linseed oil made blue, misse made green, then bedgam made red, and ise made yellow. Term seemed to make a mess of colours, but they were all pastel.\n\n\n “Hm… Though there are some outliers to these rules, but I can somewhat predict how they work.”\n\n\n We could make lots of colours with different combinations and amounts. We only needed to compare which materials made the oils change its colour.\n\n\n “You’re so focused, Myne. What are you working on?” Mum asked me. She popped out of the bedroom with Kamil resting in the sling that was used to carry babies. He was wide awake now probably because he was satiated from milk.\n\n\n “I’m going to make a picture book for Kamil. It needs lots of colourful ink, I’m trying to figure out how to make them now.”\n\n\n “You’re going to make it from scratch? That will probably take some time, huh.”\n\n\n “I guess it would. So what did Kamil do today?”\n\n\n I gently patted his head and he stared at me with his large eyes. I wasn’t a formidable sister like Delia, but I was happy enough to see that Kamil didn’t cry with me around.\n\n\n “Kamil, Kamil. I’m your big sister, Myne.”\n\n\n I played with Kamil for some time before he started to get sleepy again. Mum carried him back to bed and I went back to working on the list I had compiled.\n\n\n “Wait a second.”\n\n\n Now that I had relooked the list, I realised that the very familiar parue oil wasn’t in it.\n\n\n “Maybe we should give that a shot, too. Who know what would happen? I should probably give some to the workshop too. We also need to check if the ink’s colour will appear different on paper and how long it lasts. On top of that, we need to check if the colours can be overlapped.\n\n\n I made sure to note down everything I needed to do, and I would share them with Heidi the next time we meet."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n And so the next day arrived. Gil, Damuel, Lutz, and I headed to the ink workshop with the paper, brushes, and the rest of our parue oil from the winter. Heidi was pacing in front of the workshop. It wasn’t hard to imagine that she had been dying waiting for us. The second she saw us, her face lit up and she gave a big wave.\n\n\n Heidi was impatiently pacing back and forth the workshop, she must have been fervently expecting us. When she noticed us. she dashed over with a bright smile and waved.\n\n\n “Good morning, Lady Myne. I was looking forward to seeing you again.”\n\n\n “Good morning Heidi. I’ve finished up analysing the data.”\n\n\n I showed her all the work I had done when we got into the workshop. She was excited to receive it, but her expression quickly turned into one of disappointment.\n\n\n “I can recognise some of the words, but I can’t read most of them.”\n\n\n “Well, this occurred to me when looking through my notes…”\n\n\n I began reiterating to Heidi all the things I wanted to try, and she approved it with an excited nod.\n\n\n “It didn’t occur to me that we can use parue oil too since they are only harvested in the winter. We might get some interesting results! Let’s work on it now!”\n\n\n Heidi and Joseph worked together to mix the parue oil with different materials. Heidi mixed in red things while Joseph worked on the blue ones. They grounded and poured them in and mixed it thoroughly, but there were no changes. They both produced the exact same colour as the material mixed in.\n\n\n “All the parue oil made the colours we were looking for. That’s fascinating,” I was so surprised that my eyes grew wide. So far, everything we did had made such weird colours that now direct and expected results surprised me. Heidi gave an impressed whistle at the final product.\n\n\n “The red looks really bright too. It would be great if parue was around even when it isn’t winter.”\n\n\n I agreed with Heidi. Our hands were tied when it came to working with parue oil since it was only available on sunny winter days. This was the best oil so far, but it could not be used for mass production.\n\n\n Heidi and I were wallowing in misery about this while Joseph interrupted us with the next experiment.\n\n\n “Shall we test the ink we’ve made on the paper, then?”\n\n\n Heidi and Joseph took out all the ink we had made. I whispered to Lutz while they worked on that.\n\n\n “Hey, Lutz. Do you think we can try making some parue plant paper?”\n\n\n I asked with high expectations since the parue oil had worked so well for the ink. Just like how trombes that were feyplants had made such good paper, there was a possibility that parue trees could do the same too.\n\n\n “That’s impossible. Parue trees melt away when they get close to anything hot. Nothing would be left if you tried to steam the wood, we wouldn’t get any bark from that.”\n\n\n “…Are parue trees that weird?”\n\n\n I was never allowed to go to the forest during the winter so I never got to see a parue tree. I hear from others that they were weird but beautiful trees that only existed on winter mornings that were sunny. But that was everything I knew about them.\n\n\n “Lady Myne, we’re done.”\n\n\n Heidi called out to us and I gestured for Gil to tag along so that he could test if the ink worked with his brush and paper. I brought along some failed paper that were made of volrin and trombe so we could thoroughly test them out. The picture books weren’t going to be made of trombe paper, but there was no harm testing it.\n\n\n “…Huh.”\n\n\n As expected, the ink’s colour changed when it was written on different types of paper. The colour didn’t change much on the trombe paper, but it appeared washed out on the volrin ones. You couldn’t really tell the different unless you compared them next to each other.\n\n\n I tried to brush it off, but the colours kept fading as the ink dried.\n\n\n “We might have to make and test other kinds types of paper.”\n\n\n I was close to tears when I saw the difference in colours on the trombe and volrin paper. But Lutz seemed unbothered by it.\n\n\n “We’re only able to use volrin paper for now, so why don’t we just use colours that work for it?”\n\n\n That sounded right. The Myne Workshop could only make trombe and volrin paper, so if we wanted to get the picture books done we needed to make coloured ink that worked well on volrin paper.\n\n\n “The red looked so rich and vibrant, but it looks really dark when it has dried on paper. We can draw blood with that.”\n\n\n “What use do we have for that?!” Lutz berated.\n\n\n I puckered my lips. Maybe a colour to draw blood wasn’t that bad after all. Stories from religion tend to be pretty brutal.\n\n\n “…This is getting real difficult,” Heidi blurted out and crossed her arms with her gaze boring down on the ink.\n\n\n “Now I know why all those paint workshops are so obsessed with trying to keep their paint recipes a secret.”\n\n\n Making ink from scratch and without help was a demanding task. Benno had previously mentioned that making paint was not restricted by any magical contracts, so anyone, including workshops, were free to make it. However the workshops tend to keep the recipes to paint a secret and they did not sell them in the lower city.\n\n\n All the paint ordered at workshops were made by nobles, and they had the paint delivered straight to their estates. Rosina was the one who told me this because she herself had served a shrine maiden who adored the arts. Certain colours could only be purchased from the original workshops, so Sister Christine had been a frequent of many.\n\n\n “Lady Myne, we should try to find out what is changing the colours.”\n\n\n “I said this before, we are only concerned about the final product.”\n\n\n I found it commendable that she was so passionate about researching, unfortunately my priority lied in trying to make the picture books for Kamil. I had no plans on getting sidetracked with research right now. I needed to get the ink ready right now.\n\n\n “We’ll experiment with layering the ink now. Please, Gil.”\n\n\n “Yes, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n Gil dabbed the pen in some blue ink and drew across the colours we had tried on the paper. The layered parts quickly darkened. The colours didn’t turn black, but it was definitely a shade darker that what it was previously. None of the new mixture of colours had a bright shade. This moment called for a “Warning: Do not mix ink” sign right now.\n\n\n “…Now what?” Gil asked as he held up the paper doused in ink.\n\n\n We were all stun locked by the results that we could only stare at it in silence. Joseph was the one who spoke first.\n\n\n “Looks like we will have to keep the inks separate for now,” he shook his head with woefully.\n\n\n “Painting will still require some ink to be blended together. There must be some secret to making the paint that art workshops make.”\n\n\n Heidi made a strong point. There was no way we could make paintings seen in the temple if all the ink turned black when mixed together. I had to find out what was the secret behind the paint in this world.\n\n\n “Let’s wrap it up then. All our efforts will be futile if we don’t figure out what turns the ink black.”\n\n\n We should consider taking a peep at the secret to making paint from an art workshop, I pondered. My shoulders drooped down, disappointed at how we couldn’t finish making the ink. Today was a failure because the ink was still incomplete.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n I made my way back home with a heavy heart and told Tuuli about what unfolded today as we prepared dinner together.\n\n\n “…The ink we made can’t be used. I’m at a loss right now.”\n\n\n “Yeah, the ink can’t be turning black when mixed.”\n\n\n “I know right? I’m at a dead-end right now. No matter what I do, the ink can’t be used for printing.”\n\n\n I pursed my lips as I continued to mix the ingredients into the soup\n\n\n Mum was watching us cook as she fed Kamil, after hearing this she cupped her cheeks and asked.\n\n\n “Did you not use a fixing agent when writing with the ink?”\n\n\n “…A fixing agent?”\n\n\n I did come across the word ‘fixing agents’ when reading about photos and paintings back when I was still Urano. However, I was absolutely clueless about what fixing agents were used for here. Mum could tell that I didn’t know about it, so she responded while looking at Kamil.\n\n\n “A fixing agent is a type of liquid we used to set the colours in cloth dye so that it doesn’t fade over time.:\n\n\n “Mum, could you explain more? How do you make a fixing agent?”\n\n\n My eyes lit up hearing about this, but Mum responded with a gaze of worry.\n\n\n “Will it be fine for me to tell you more?”\n\n\n “After this, I’ll go check if the recipe is restricted by any magic contracts.”\n\n\n “…Alright, it shouldn’t be a big deal anyways. I’m sure that you know how to take care of yourself.” Mum sounded a little hesitant but continued on anyways.\n\n\n It turns out that the fixing agent was basically made from extracting the sap from a genade tree and boiling it with the stem of a flower plant called heylene until it turns into a thick solution. After that you have to dissolve it down to one-twentieth with hot water.\n\n\n “But you need to alter it so that it can be used on paper, and not cloth.\n\n\n “Mhmm, thank you, Mum. I’ll do my best.”\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n With this new profound knowledge in hand, I quickly got Lutz to gather all the ingredients we needed. Seeing how his look of surprise, Lutz definitely didn’t know about fixing agents too.\n\n\n “I never heard about that before. Thank goodness that Mrs Effa had works in a dye workshop.”\n\n\n “You’re right. I want to get all the things ready as quick as possible and get things cooking now that Mum has told me how to make them.”\n\n\n I was buzzing with excitement to start work, but was interrupted by Lutz and Gil.\n\n\n “You just need to tell us how to make it.”\n\n\n “That’s right, we should be the one making it. No need to go out of your way to make it, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n I wasn’t going to be able to get hands on with the fixing agent if we were going to make it in the Myne workshop. I pouted my lips in indignation.\n\n\n I made a request to Benno to see if the fixing agents were bounded by any magic contracts in the Merchant’s Guild. He also gave us his assist in gathering the materials we needed.\n\n\n On that very day, Lutz and Gil were about to erupt from sheer joy at what they were going to do. I had all the instructions written down on a board for them, and that was all I could do. But I wasn’t happy that I was left out, so I ranted about the coloured ink to Rosina after our harspiel practice to left off some steam.\n\n\n “It’s so unfair that Lutz and Gil get to make the fixing agent right now. Don’t you think so too?”\n\n\n I was expecting Rosina to sympathise with me, but she just looked at my in surprise that I didn’t know about fixing agents.\n\n\n “Huh? Sister Myne, you didn’t know about fixing agents?” she asked looking flabbergasted. “You need them for every painting. It’s near impossible to paint one without it.”\n\n\n I was left stumped, someone this close to me in the temple knew about fixing agents too. They were an essential ingredient when it came to painting. But Rosina didn’t know how to make them since she only every worked it pre-pared ones.\n\n\n “… Pardon my rudeness, but do you perhaps not know how to use fixing agents too, Sister Myne?”\n\n\n “Unfortunately not. Could I get you to teach me, Rosina?”\n\n\n Mum only used fixing agents for dying clothes, but I needed to know how to use it to paint art on the picture books.\n\n\n My blunt and desperate request made Rosina giggle.\n\n\n “You need to cover the paper with the fixing agent and set it to dry first. Drying it is important so ink doesn’t smudge when you put it on. Sister Myne, you always seem to be omniscient about everything, I was surprised that something this simple has slipped past your nose.”\n\n\n “Well I haven’t tried painting or making ink before.”\n\n\n “That is right,” Rosina whispered out. She clasped her hands together and gave me a gentle smile.\n\n\n “Well then, it would be much better to have Wilma instruct you how to draw once your ink and fixing agent are complete. Art is an essential piece in every woman’s upbringing.”\n\n\n “I will note it down.”\n\n\n I didn’t want to give a direct answer to her recommendation because I already made up my mind.\n\n\n No way, I’m already busy enough as it is.\n\n\n But some part of me was fighting that thought, that it would perhaps be a wiser choice for me to learn it now. I was becoming a noble’s adopted daughter in two years.\n\n\n With the recipe on how to make a fixing agent, paired with Rosina’s instructions with how to use them, we were able to paint layers of colours without any of them turning black or getting miscoloured. We had successfully made coloured ink."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Alright, Corinna, I’m off. Renate, Knut, behave yourselves. Tuuli, finish Lady Rozemyne’s hair pin as soon as possible.”\n\n\n “Understood, Master”\n\n\n Master Otto kissed Mistress Corinna on the cheek and then also gave a light peck on the cheek to Knut, their newborn son whom she was carrying. He then stroked the head of his beloved daughter, Renate. He tried to kiss Mistress Corinna again, but Theo and Leon dragged him off to the temple.\n\n\n They said it was a preliminary meeting for a summons from the archduke in the spring. Until now, the Gilberta Company had never been invited to a business deal with another duchy so all the leherls were pleased with the company’s progress.\n\n\n “……For some reason I’ve got a bad feeling about this.”\n\n\n While finishing up the hair pin I was currently working on, I stared at the various shades of thread I’d collected to make the red koralie and muttered quietly to myself.\n\n\n ……When Myne makes a request, it’s always something that’s completely outside my realm of expectations.\n\n\n The other day, even though it was snowing, Lutz brought me a letter requesting for me to make a hair pin with a red koralie flower. There have been times when Myne has introduced the Gilberta Company to nobles interested in hair pins, but this was the first time she had specifically asked for me to make one.\n\n\n But even if she says the client has blonde hair, the shade of blonde is different for each individual. The colour of the thread used for the hair pin has to be changed depending on whether the red of the dress is closer to orange or perhaps closer to pink and whether the colour intonations are dark or light. I also don’t know whether large flowers would look better or whether I should make smaller flowers. I can’t make a hair pin without more specific information…\n\n\n …… Master Otto said he would collect more information about it, but I don’t think it’s possible to make a hair pin for a customer who I’ve never even seen. I’ve never had any experience with this, at least not other than helping other craftsmen with ready-made products for the store.\n\n\n I was concentrating on making hair pins and hadn’t even noticed that Master Otto and the others had returned until the leherl Leon knocked on the door and said, “The master wants to see you”. I set aside my nearly completed hair pin and headed to Master Otto’s office.\n\n\n “Tuuli, I’ve received more detailed information on the client for the red koralie.”\n\n\n Inside the office, there was Master Otto who was in a good mood, and Mistress Corinna who looked a little troubled. My bad premonition seemed to be right on the mark. When I heard his words, I almost couldn’t believe my ears and struggled to understand their meaning.\n\n\n “Eh!? It’s a request from royalty!?”\n\n\n I wondered just where exactly Myne has been and what could she have possibly done for something like this to happen. It was completely outside my expectations that a prince would ask me to make a hair pin for the woman he’s interested in.\n\n\n “T-That’s impossible, Master”\n\n\n “It’s not impossible, Tuuli. The royals liked Lady Rozemyne’s hair pin and asked us to make it because it can’t be made in other duchies. Hence, it’s fine for you to make it. Just like you did for Lady Rozemyne, as long as you make it better than the hair pins you made before, there will be no problem.”\n\n\n It’s easy for Master Otto to say, “If you make it, it’ll turn out fine,” but I’m sure there’s no way it’s that simple. Mistress Corinna who makes outfits for nobles as a craftswoman, understood exactly how I felt. She glared at Master Otto with a troubled face.\n\n\n “Don’t be absurd, Otto. That’s like asking her to make something even better than what she made for Lady Rozemyne. Tuuli is a minor and has never received an order from an unknown customer before. It’s unreasonable to tell her to take on a royal commission out of the blue. If you don’t feel confident and don’t think you can do it, you don’t have to make it, Tuuli.”\n\n\n “That would be a problem, Corinna. If it’s Tuuli, she’d be able to make it, right?”\n\n\n Master Otto is not a craftsman, so I don’t think he really understands. He doesn’t know how difficult it is to make something that suits a person who you’ve never met and have them be satisfied with it.\n\n\n The hair pin I was asked to make was for a coming-of-age ceremony. In the letter it was written that “the colour of the dress is red” so I think the dress has probably already been prepared. It would be a disaster if the hair pin gifted by the prince did not match the outfit of the woman he intended on gifting it to. At the very least, if I had the costume with me to use as a reference or if the customer had ordered it from Gilberta Company, I might be able to make it work. However, there’s nothing I can do if I don’t have anything to work off.\n\n\n “It’s impossible. I know the kinds of flowers and colour combinations that Lady Rozemyne likes and I can make hair pins that suit Lady Rozemyne well. I am confident that I won’t lose at this to anyone else. However, I have never custom made any hair pins for other nobles and I don’t think I could make one that would satisfy royalty.”\n\n\n When I refused, Master Otto turned pale and held his head in his hands, saying, “this is a problem”, but Mistress Corinna agreed with me, saying, “Tuuli’s right”.\n\n\n “But Corinna, It’s a commission for Tuuli ……”\n\n\n “Otto, shut up. Tuuli, you don’t need to worry about it. I’ll leave it to some other craftsman who thinks they can do it.”\n\n\n When Mistress Corinna asked me to leave the room, I excused myself from the office while holding complicated feelings at the words, “I’ll leave it to some other craftsman.”\n\n\n *\n\n\n That evening, Mr Benno came to the Gilberta Company while covered in snow.\n\n\n “Brother, what did you come here for at such a late hour!?”\n\n\n Mistress Corinna rushed over, leaving her son, Knut in the care of a female servant. Renate also shouted joyfully, “Yay, Uncle Benno!” and followed after her. Mr Benno often visits to educate Renate, who will be the heir to the Gilberta Company. Mr Benno is Renate’s beloved uncle who often looked after her ever since she stopped being spoiled by her mother when Knut was born.\n\n\n “I was bored from being shut in by the snow. Come and play with me. Read me a picture book.”\n\n\n “I’m here on official business today. I can’t do that until I’m done. If you understand that, then be a good girl and wait, Renate.”\n\n\n Mr Benno lightly waved his hand and shooed her away. As if to protect Renate who looked like her feelings had been hurt, Master Otto stood between them and glared at Mr Benno.\n\n\n “Hey, Benno. You don’t have to be so harsh with her, do you?”\n\n\n “Huh? Whose fault do you think it is that I had to come all this way when it’s snowing?”\n\n\n From just a single look at the sharpness of his eyes as he glared back at Master Otto, it was clear that it was Master Otto who called Mr Benno here. After closely watching the interaction of the grown-ups, Renate quickly fled the scene while saying, “I’ll get uncle to read me a picture book when he’s in a better mood.”\n\n\n “Tuuli”\n\n\n When the ill-tempered Mr Benno called my name, I flinched. The instant our eyes met, Mr Benno jutted his chin towards me. That was enough for me to understand what he was here for. It was regarding my refusal of the royal commission.\n\n\n ……Am I going to be admonished for refusing?\n\n\n The mere thought of it gave me a suffocating level of fear and apprehension. Was it because he was the master of a separate store named the Plantin Company? Or was it because he was Myne’s oldest acquaintance and the closest to her out all the merchants? Was it because he was responsible for deciding which people from the lower city could be brought to the temple? Being scolded by Mr Benno gave me a completely different level of fear compared when I’m scolded by Master Otto or Mistress Corinna.\n\n\n Master Otto and Mr Benno quickly moved into the office and Mistress Corinna looked at me, holding her forehead while muttering “Geez, Otto is……”\n\n\n “Tuuli, if you can’t do it then even if it’s Benno, just say no. If you force yourself to try to make something when you don’t have any confidence in making a good product, you won’t be able to satisfy the customer. I’m on your side, Tuuli. I can’t overlook the possibility of ruining a good craftswoman.”\n\n\n From her perspective as a craftswoman and a workshop manager, Mistress Corinna supported me from behind and smiled as if to reassure me. Feeling as if I could breathe a little easier, I walked together with her to the office.\n\n\n The moment the door shut, Mr.Benno crossed his arms and looked at me. His reddish-brown eyes stared at me as if to say he wouldn’t let me escape. My heart began to race and my body started to tremble.\n\n\n “Tuuli. I heard that you turned down Lady Rozemyne’s request so I would like to know your reason why… Do you have any other commissions?　Or are you saying that you can’t make the same kind of product for royalty?”\n\n\n My lips quivered. I didn’t know what to say. I looked at Master Otto, Mr Benno, and Mistress Corinna in turn. When our eyes met, Mistress Corinna nodded lightly as if to encourage me.\n\n\n “Those were… Lady Rozemyne’s hair pins were made with the intention of providing a little support to Myne, who lives in noble society to protect her family. It was made with my feelings for Myne who was poisoned and had to sleep for two years… I don’t have confidence I can make something like that again.”\n\n\n Mistress Corinna’s concerns were right on the money. I wasn’t sure whether I could make something for someone else with the same feelings I had when I made it for Myne. There were no falsehoods in my words.\n\n\n “Until now you’ve made a lot of hair pins for nobles, haven’t you? Aren’t you the one who taught all the other craftsmen how to make hair pins?”\n\n\n I slowly shook my head in response to Master Otto’s impetuous words.\n\n\n “Those were off-the-shelf products made with the same standards as other craftsmen, and I’ve been told to make them with a lower quality than what I would make for the archduke’s adopted daughter. Obviously the requirements are different when it’s for nobility compared to when it’s for royalty, right?”\n\n\n “Yeah, what is required is something equal to or better than what you’ve made for Lady Rozemyne.”\n\n\n “I’ve never made hair pins for a customer I’ve never met, nor do I have any experience trying to match an outfit I’ve never seen before. On top of all that, you’re telling me that my first time is going to be a commission from royalty…”\n\n\n I don’t know what the great duchy’s princess looks like, nor do I know her hair colour or what her dress looks like. In such circumstances, even if you ask me to make a hair pin that is better than Myne’s, I don’t have any confidence that I can do it.\n\n\n “I see, it’s understandable that you would feel a sense of repulsion when told that your first hair pin commission from a client other than Lady Rozemyne would be from a member of royalty.”\n\n\n Mr Benno scratched his bangs and let a troubled expression show on his face. I let out a sigh of relief as I realised that he had accepted my opinion. I trust Mr Benno because I know he wouldn’t just give me any thoughtless orders and would properly heed my opinions.\n\n\n ……Hmm?\n\n\n I realised that Mr.Benno’s reddish-brown eyes hadn’t lost their resolve. They remained sharp and alert as if to make sure they captured my every reaction. When our eyes met, Mr Benno’s gaze grew even more intense.\n\n\n “Tuuli, if you insist that you can’t do it no matter what, then we have no choice but to leave it to another craftsman. But if the product turns out to be unsatisfactory, Lady Rozemyne will be scorned as the person responsible for it.”\n\n\n “Eh……”\n\n\n “Even if we offered her a hair pin crafted by another craftsman, Lady Rozemyne probably wouldn’t scold or dismiss you from your position as her personal hair pin craftswoman. She would simply keep her emotions buried in her chest while being denounced by royalty.”\n\n\n Mr Benno said that even if I couldn’t produce a hair pin that satisfied royalty, Myne would protect me from the ire of others, but Myne herself and the archduke would both be scolded by the royals.\n\n\n “And when that happens, would Tuuli not regret it? Would you not end up resenting the craftsman who was appointed, thinking that if you had made it yourself, you might have made something a little bit better and perhaps Lady Rozemyne wouldn’t have had to suffer the painful experience of being denounced by royalty?”\n\n\n …… Of course I’d regret something like that!\n\n\n I had sworn to do everything I could to help her. I could easily see myself stamping my feet in frustration and regret for failing to keep that promise.\n\n\n “Hey, Benno…”\n\n\n When Mistress Corinna tried to stop him, Mr Benno waved his hand to silence her, but his gaze remained steadfast on me the entire time. He looked straight at me and told me the harsh reality. Mr Benno is different from Mistress Corinna, who was always trying to protect me. But within those strict reddish-brown eyes, I could see his trust and confidence in me.\n\n\n “You were able to make something that Lady Rozemyne was able to puff out her chest and proudly present as having been made by her personal craftswoman. This is a job for Lady Rozemyne’s personal craftswoman. Is it really okay to give it to someone else?”\n\n\n The reason I’m Lady Rozemyne’s personal hair pin craftswoman is because I still possess skills that others cannot match. It’s because I can make hair pins that are suitable for the archduke’s daughter. If there exists a craftsman whose skills are recognized by royalty, there is a possibility that I will be replaced. I suddenly remembered the words that Lutz once said to me. “You’d have to give her hair pins made by someone else, all while pretending that you made them yourself.”\n\n\n …… I don’t want that to happen.\n\n\n This is something I can’t run away from. This is a job that I can’t afford to pass to anyone else. Having realised this, I stood up and looked straight back at the reddish-brown eyes which had been observing me this entire time before opening my mouth.\n\n\n “…… No, I’ll make it! Please let me make it!”\n\n\n Master Otto slapped his desk with a shout of “Alright!” while Mr Benno stood up and lightly patted me on the shoulder.\n\n\n “Tuuli, I had faith that you would say that. Good luck.”\n\n\n The tension in his reddish-brown eyes vanished and as he smiled, I could see his trust in me showing on his face. I could feel something indescribable tugging at my heartstrings. It felt like something wonderful was going to happen if I managed to get through this trial. Feelings of joy welled up within me. My entire body burned bright with the conviction that I was definitely going to make a hair pin that would surprise everyone and leave them satisfied.\n\n\n “Geez, you’re being so pushy. Tuuli, you shouldn’t carry this burden alone. Let’s make it together with everyone else.”\n\n\n Mistress Corinna sighed in exasperation and looked at me with eyes full of concern. I nodded back to her with a smile brimming full of motivation.\n\n\n “I’d like to know as much as possible about the customer so that I can do everything I possibly can to satisfy them.”\n\n\n *\n\n\n After that, I was extremely busy. There really was far too little time until the deadline to make something more intricate and beautiful than Myne’s hair pin. After discussing with Mistress Corinna and the other craftsmen about the most suitable size for an adult woman, selecting the red thread that looked best with Lutz’s blonde hair and asking my colleagues Inez and Karen to make small flowers and leaves to decorate the surroundings, the Gilberta Company began to work together to make the hair pin.\n\n\n It was a hair pin with small white flowers surrounding a warm red koralie, the precious colour of the earth goddess, and young green leaves flowing like vines, reminding us of the coming of spring. It was completed on a day when the end of winter was fast approaching. I contacted the temple and soon received an invitation for delivery.\n\n\n Then, on the day of delivery, I headed for the temple in a carriage with Master Otto and Mr Benno while carrying the box containing the hair pin which I had made with my best possible efforts. I was extremely nervous since I had to deliver the hair pin in-person.\n\n\n For starters, I was nervous about heading to the temple in an unfamiliar carriage since I had always gone there on foot. Secondly, since I was going to meet Myne for the first time since she woke after falling asleep for two years. I was also anxious about the very act of meeting Myne itself. I was confident that I had made a beautiful high quality product fit for royalty, but there was a difference between a good product and a product that suited the customer. I wasn’t sure if the prince would be satisfied with my work. I got nervous just imagining the possibility of disappointing Myne.\n\n\n …… Ahh, I’m so nervous that I’m not going to be able to move!\n\n\n Even though my mind was in a complete mess, the High Priest was together in the orphanage director’s office with Myne. I hadn’t expected him to be there. It was the first time I had seen him since the contract to turn Myne into Lady Rozemyne. The image of him speaking in a cold and stern manner was strongly burned into the back of my mind. That’s why I felt chills all over my body.\n\n\n “High Priest, This is Otto, the successor of the Gilberta Company, and Tuuli, Lady Rozemyne’s personal hair pin craftswoman.”\n\n\n I stiffened at Mr Benno’s introduction and joined Master Otto in giving a greeting towards a noble. I focused and tried my best to keep myself from stuttering. I had never been so glad to have been educated by Wilma and Rosina until now.\n\n\n “May I pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the harsh judgment of Ewigeliebe?”\n\n\n “I give you my heartfelt blessings. I pray that the God of Life Ewigeliebe will henceforth bring guidance to the Gilberta Company.”\n\n\n The High Priest gave us his blessings in a shower of light. The slightly warm light gave me encouragement, but simultaneously brought about a mix of complex emotions as if I was once again confronted with the difference between a noble and a commoner.\n\n\n “This is the item you ordered.”\n\n\n Prompted by Mr Benno’s words, I held out the box with the hair pin and stepped in front of Myne, who was dressed as the high bishop. Her sparkling golden eyes and her hair pin adorned indigo blue hair were the same as the Myne who I had always known. Her height and facial features also hadn’t changed from the Myne in my memories. Perhaps she actually seemed smaller to me due to my own growth? Or was it because I unconsciously compared her to Kamil’s growth?\n\n\n I felt terribly relieved to see that Myne hadn’t changed and with such feelings in my heart, I showed her the item commissioned by the royals. I’ve already grown accustomed to the act of carefully opening the box and showing the hair pin inside.\n\n\n “……It’s lovely”\n\n\n Myne gasped at the sight of the red koralie hair pin. As she looked at me with approval in her eyes, I secretly felt relieved while keeping my smile pasted on my face. If I passed Myne’s assessment, then it’ll probably be okay. Even when she was a commoner, Myne’s eye for clothes and accessories was so amazing that even Mr Benno was impressed.\n\n\n “Yes, there should be no problems with something like this. Well done, Gilberta Company.”\n\n\n “It’s made very well. I’m sure Lady Eglantine will be very pleased with it. You’ve really become good at this haven’t you, Tuuli? I’m impressed.”\n\n\n “Thank you for your kind words. Seeing Lady Rozemyne’s healthy appearance also fills me with joy.”\n\n\n Once I received praised from both of them, I was able to smile a little more naturally. My heart, which had been full of tension and nervousness, was now filled with feelings of pride and accomplishment.\n\n\n “Also, I would like to present this to Lady Rozemyne.”\n\n\n I brought out yet another box. It was the Spring-themed hair pin I had made for Myne. In order to make the deadline for the red koralie hair pin, I had finished this one in a hurry, so upon close inspection you could see that some parts weren’t done too well. I hope she doesn’t notice.\n\n\n “Oh my, what a lovely hair pin. Could you please put it on for me?”\n\n\n I nodded while replying “yes” and carefully changed Myne’s hair pin while paying attention to the High Priest’s reactions. With my fingertips, I rearranged Myne’s hair, which was a little disheveled and hanging over her shoulders and swept it down her back. Holding myself back from patting her on the head like I used to in the past, I stepped back and commented “It’s done”.\n\n\n “…How does it look?”\n\n\n Myne’s maintained her poker face as she looked back at me. The stern gaze of the High Priest, who was scrutinising our interactions, told me that I couldn’t afford to let down my guard. What was the permissible degree of familiarity between a craftsman and a customer? I desperately tried to recall the words Mistress Corinna would use when complimenting a client.\n\n\n “Lady Rozemyne, it’s a hair pin that I made especially for you. Of course, it looks very good on you.”\n\n\n When I giggled, Myne broke into a smile as well.\n\n\n …This degree of interaction is allowed, right?\n\n\n I only found out later that Mistress Corinna’s words which I had used for reference were intended for talks between commoners, and not the kind of attitude one should show towards a noble.\n\n\n *\n\n\n After completion of the hair pin’s sale, the carriage carrying us began to rumble as we passed through the gates of the temple. Once I could hear the familiar hustle and bustle of the main street, I was finally able to relieve my pent-up tension.\n\n\n “I was really nervous because the High Priest was there.”\n\n\n When I relaxed and voiced my thoughts, Master Otto chuckled in agreement.\n\n\n “I also didn’t expect the High Priest to be there, so I was just as surprised. But I’m glad we were able to greet him without screwing up.”\n\n\n “Yeah. You guys didn’t only ace your greetings, you even got praised by the High Priest. Nobles usually never compliment any commoners. Even when taking Lady Rozemyne’s favouritism into account, you guys did well. Good job, Tuuli.”\n\n\n Mr Benno had completely reverted to his usual self with no semblance to the man who had been putting on airs while interacting with nobles. He smiled cheerfully while patting me lightly on the head.\n\n\n “Kyaa!”\n\n\n My heart skipped a beat. I was so startled that I almost leapt out of my skin and then reflexively shielded my head. For some reason, I suddenly simultaneously felt very happy and embarrassed as my face started turning red.\n\n\n “…… Geez, Mr Benno! I’m not a child any more so please don’t pat me on the head.”\n\n\n I must have felt embarrassed because I was being treated like a kid. I glared at Mr Benno but he simply said “My bad, my bad” with an expression that didn’t look even slightly apologetic at all, and started to talk with Master Otto about the scheduled sale of goods in the castle when Spring comes around.\n\n\n I looked out the window and tried my best to forget about these embarrassing feelings. But the sensation of a large hand patting my head still lingered and wouldn’t disappear. I tried putting my own hand on my head but something about it felt different.\n\n\n My reflection in the window was smiling happily back at me. I wondered if it was because I had been praised for the hair pin I had worked so hard to make. I recalled my feelings of joy in the temple earlier when I had been praised by Myne and the High Priest. But it was somewhat different to how I felt when Mr Benno had just patted me on the head.\n\n\n …What is this, I wonder…? Could I have felt the happiest when I was being praised by Mr Benno…? I’ve never felt this way before… I wonder what these feelings are…\n\n\n It would be a long time until I understood the meaning of these feelings I’d experienced for the first time."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Welcome back, Otto.”\n\n\n Having finished all my work in the morning, I was greeted by Corinna’s gentle voice as I returned home in the afternoon. My dear wife welcomed me back with a cute smile on her face. I doubt there’s any greater happiness than this. Complementing her cream coloured hair and grey eyes, her tidy clothes gave her a gentle soothing aura and suited her well. Her round cheeks and smooth nose gave her a bit of a babylike face, but it was adorable to see her worry herself over it.\n\n\n I really want to stand in the middle of the world and shout “My Corinna is the cutest girl in the world!”\n\n\n “I’m home, Corinna.”\n\n\n After having listened to the gruff voices of Captain and other men all day, Corinna’s voice healed my soul. Once again, I was made to understand Corinna’s greatness. I hugged my wife and indulged in the softness of her flesh, before breathing in her sweet aroma.\n\n\n …Haa… I don’t want to go to work anymore. I’d rather just hug Corinna all day long.\n\n\n “I wasn’t feeling too good today. If I can’t see Corinna’s happy smile I just… Hmm? You were here, Benno?”\n\n\n “I was talking to Corinna before you returned home but it seems like you completely ignored my existence.”\n\n\n Even though Benno said that with an exasperated look on his face, it’s only natural to not be able to see any guys standing next to Corinna. I don’t care if you’re her brother, don’t get so close to her.\n\n\n “What were you talking to her about?”\n\n\n “Who knows… Well then, Corinna, I’m going back downstairs.”\n\n\n Without answering my question, Benno passed me by and left. After she followed partway to see him off, I could hear Benno say “have a good think about it”. Recently, Corinna has been under the weather quite a lot. Could it possibly be due to something Benno said to her?\n\n\n “What were you talking to Benno about? It looked like he had something important to say to you.”\n\n\n “Otto, once I make up my mind, I promise I’ll tell you too.”\n\n\n Having been gently turned down, I replied “Okay, I understand” but in the depths of my heart I was thinking “Not again”. Recently, there’s been many instances of this happening. It feels like they’re sneakily plotting something behind my back whenever I’m away.\n\n\n …Corinna and Benno are hiding some sort of secret from me.\n\n\n Recently, due to necessity of keeping Myne’s circumstances a secret, I’ve often been asked to help out at the store or been taken along to business talks with the Merchant’s Guild. As a result of frequently coming in and out of the store, the leherls have all been interacting with me in a friendly manner and Mark even told me that he would soon be increasing the frequency with which I could enter the store, so I would like to think that I have earned a little bit of trust.\n\n\n …At this point, what kind of secret would they need to hide from me?\n\n\n Even if it were to be something business-related, considering it has caused Corinna to stop smiling for days, it shouldn’t be something that should be hidden from her husband.\n\n\n …Hmm? Now that I think about it, I was never told that it was a business-related secret. Since I wasn’t allowed in on the conversation, I just naturally assumed it was something related to the Gilberta Company, but neither Benno nor Corinna ever said it had anything to do with the business. If it’s something unrelated to work then that must mean it was related to Corinna’s private life. But I can’t imagine something which would require Benno to tell Corinna and then tell her to keep it a secret. There were times when Corinna would say “If you do that, I’ll divorce you” as a joke or when she would be angry with me, but I can’t imagine her actually going through with it.\n\n\n …I didn’t do anything that would anger Benno to that extent, right?\n\n\n It’s scary to be left completely out of the loop without any idea of what was going on.\n\n\n Was it a bad idea to say “Myne is Benno’s Goddess of Water”? Or did he get angry when I asked about his history with the Merchant Guildmaster? Is it because Myne took my advice to continue doing the work she had been doing and hence refused the invitation to join the Gilberta Company as an apprentice merchant? Or did they just not mention that it was business-related but had actually run into some sort of problem?\n\n\n As I continued racking my brain, I tried observing Corinna to see if I could find any hints.\n\n\n Is it possible that due to Corinna having been under the weather, Benno would tell me to “take responsibility and break up with her”?\n\n\n …No, I don’t think that…\n\n\n In that instant, I suddenly remembered something. It was something Benno told me before I married Corinna.\n\n\n “The heir of the Gilberta Company is going to be Corinna’s daughter.”\n\n\n The reason why a mere travelling merchant such as I was able to marry the Gilberta Company’s heiress Corinna, was because Benno wanted to find an excuse to turn down the Guildmaster’s advances and unify the store in a situation where he desperately needed allies. It wasn’t a marriage where I was desired for my qualities as a potential husband of the store’s heiress. I was only chosen because there weren’t any other options available.\n\n\n It’s already been almost three years since I married Corinna in those circumstances, but we haven’t been able to have any kids yet. There were no problems in my daily life with Corinna, but from Corinna’s standpoint, it would be troublesome if she were not able to give birth to an heiress. It would disqualify me from being her husband.\n\n\n …I would be cut off. It wouldn’t be something that could be appealed against by saying emotionally-driven words such as “we love each other” or “I don’t want to leave”. The company will always be the highest priority. Having discovered a probable reason why Benno might request a divorce, I tightly gripped my hand into a fist.\n\n\n “Otto, what’s the matter?”\n\n\n “Corinna, tonight I intend to put in even more effort than I have until now.”\n\n\n “…Eh? I don’t know what you plan on putting all your effort into but your eyes are scaring me.”\n\n\n At the very least, I have to make sure Corinna won’t divorce me. I’ll give my all to do anything Corinna asks of me. Seeing me burning up with motivation, Corinna made a worried expression and put a bit of distance between us.\n\n\n “Otto, you must be tired after having just returned from work. I’ll head to the workshop now so please take a nap until dinnertime.”\n\n\n As I was told to by Corinna, I took a nap to rest in preparation for tonight.\n\n\n “Master Otto, there’s a message for you from Master Benno. After dinner tonight, he wants you to head to his room together with Mistress Corinna. Apparently there’s something important he wants to tell you.”\n\n\n After I woke up from my nap, my servant Matilda conveyed Benno’s message to me.\n\n\n “Not his office, but his private room…?”\n\n\n From the situation alone, it was easy to tell that this was a very important discussion. The only time I was ever allowed into Benno’s private room was when I officially proposed to Corinna before our marriage. As long as I didn’t have business there, I would never go to the 2nd floor of the Gilberta Company which is where all the leherls lived. At the time of the marriage, one of the conditions was that I wasn’t allowed onto the 2nd floor where Benno lived so that people wouldn’t mistakenly think that a travelling merchant such as I was going to inherit the company.\n\n\n Recently I’ve been forced to do a lot of work related to Myne so I have been coming in and out of Benno’s office and have occasionally gone to the 2nd floor. There were insufficient personnel who knew about Myne’s circumstances and whom she wouldn’t be wary of, so I was needed to make up for the shortage in labour. But I had never been called up to Benno’s private room.\n\n\n “Corinna, do you know what this discussion is going to be about?”\n\n\n After finishing dinner, the two of us left our dwelling and headed down the stairs. I wanted to collect as much information as possible before arriving at Benno’s room but Corinna just softly giggled.\n\n\n “Of course I do. Brother is having this talk with us because I finally made up my mind.”\n\n\n “Because you made up your mind?”\n\n\n “Yep. Otto, you didn’t do anything wrong but I want you to be mentally prepared coming into this.”\n\n\n Corinna’s troubled expression was cute but I felt danger from those words and instantly all the blood drained from my face. My fears from earlier were beginning to feel more and more realistic.\n\n\n …Did Corinna make up her mind to divorce me!?\n\n\n “Corinna, does that mean…”\n\n\n Perhaps because my words were croaked out in a hoarse voice, Corinna didn’t pay me any heed and knocked twice on the door to the 2nd floor. Mark had apparently been waiting for us as he immediately opened the door and guided us inside. The leherls were still eating dinner but Benno had already finished and was waiting for us in his room. He probably chose to eat dinner separately because it was going to be a discussion that he wouldn’t want the leherls to overhear.\n\n\n “Take a seat.”\n\n\n As soon as we entered, Benno pointed at a chair in front of him with a complicated expression on his face. It was the exact same seat that I sat in when I talked to Benno before my marriage with Corinna. I instinctively tensed up and felt like my throat was dry. Back then, I felt ecstatic as if I was leaping headfirst into a bright future, but this time around, I was fearful and anxious that this happy lifestyle of mine was going to be taken away from me.\n\n\n “There isn’t a lot of time until the leherls finish eating so let’s jump straight to the main topic. It has been decided that Myne is going to be entering the temple as a blue-robed apprentice priestess.”\n\n\n “What?”\n\n\n I repeatedly blinked as I slowly comprehended the words which were completely different to my expectations. The topic wasn’t about Corinna divorcing me, but rather, Myne becoming a blue-robed apprentice priestess. Honestly speaking, I had no idea why this had anything to do with me. I don’t think it’s something that needs to be said in the privacy of Benno’s room.\n\n\n “Is this about her no longer being able to help me do calculations at the gate? Captain didn’t say anything but I don’t really think this is something that must be kept secret from the leherls…”\n\n\n “…Do I have to explain from there?”\n\n\n Benno looked annoyed but nevertheless gave me an explanation about the temple and orphanage and the difference between blue and grey robes. Having grown up as a travelling merchant, the only times I’ve ever visited the temple were when I bought citizenship and when I married Corinna, so I didn’t have the basic knowledge and common sense that a city’s inhabitants would usually have.\n\n\n “I now understand why Captain didn’t talk about Myne entering the temple… But what does all of this have to do with me?”\n\n\n “Quit your job as a soldier.”\n\n\n I became a soldier for the sake of marrying Corinna. If Benno wants me to quit, then that means…\n\n\n With the new products invented by Myne, the Gilberta Company had not only returned to its former glory but was now getting more business than it ever had in the past. Benno was also pleased that he now had enough clout to bark back at the Guildmaster. Considering we hadn’t had any children yet, it meant there was no longer a need for the heiress of the company to marry a mere travelling merchant.\n\n\n “Benno, I don’t care about your opinion. I’m never going to divorce Corinna! If you want kids then I’ll show you—”\n\n\n “Who told you to divorce? Idiot, finish listening to me before you talk! I want you to quit your post as a soldier and come work in this store. Due to the new products Myne introduced, we have a severe shortage of human resources. I need you to come help out.”\n\n\n “Huh? Eh?”\n\n\n Benno’s words were completely out of my realm of expectations, to the point where I was having trouble following the conversation.\n\n\n “The current Gilberta Company is already inseparable from Myne. Yet despite that, she’s become a blue-robed apprentice priestess at the temple which has strong links to nobility. I can not predict what kind of influence this will have on the company.”\n\n\n There was the risk of the company being crushed by the mere whims of a noble, but on the contrary, there was also the possibility of it becoming a store which nobles frequently relied upon. At the current point in time, there was no telling what would happen in the future, but Benno wanted to limit the amount of influence Myne’s actions could have on the company as much as possible.\n\n\n “I’m not only concerned about the influence of nobles. I’m getting a lot of petitions from that sh*tty geezer. I’m going to go independent with the stuff that has nothing to do with the Gilberta Company’s original line of business of clothing, such as Myne’s paper and the cooking industry that she’s going to be starting from now on. I will help Myne while she’s a blue-robed apprentice priestess. That’s why I want you to take my place in the Gilberta Company.”\n\n\n If Benno were to start up his own company, he would lose all the permits and reputation that he has built so far. As a new business owner, he would have no backing from the nobility nor any funding. He would no longer be treated as the owner of a large company.\n\n\n “…Does Myne have enough value for you to throw away your position as the owner of a large company? It only looks like a bad gamble to me. From your earlier explanation, I can already imagine that a commoner blue-robed apprentice priestess like Myne would be hated by the real blue-robed priests in the temple.”\n\n\n Benno folded his arms and said “Well, that sounds about right” as if I was only stating the obvious. It seemed like he was going through with the idea despite understanding the risks. I wanted to stop him because I didn’t want Corinna to feel sad if something went wrong. But Benno had no intention of changing his mind.\n\n\n “You know, I actually make bad gambles all the time. Even back when I gave permission for your marriage with Corinna, everyone around me was trying to get me to change my mind.”\n\n\n “And you’re really going to feel safe handing over the store to someone like me?”\n\n\n “I see… In other words, you want me to hand over the position of Corinna’s husband to someone else?”\n\n\n Having found a weakness he could attack, Benno’s lips curled into an evil grin.\n\n\n But his face wasn’t serious and it was clear he was only teasing me rather than seriously telling me to divorce Corinna.\n\n\n “I’m Corinna’s husband! Who the hell would give her up?”\n\n\n My relief at the discussion not being about divorce and my joy at being able to become a merchant again swept through my entire body. It was clear that Benno wasn’t going to change his mind, regardless of what I would say to him. In which case, it was in my best interests to ride this momentum.\n\n\n “If you’re motivated, then I plan on training you as soon as possible. When will you be able to quit your post as soldier?”\n\n\n “…As expected, I would need a turnover period to find a successor. I’ll talk to Captain so that I can quit the job as soon as possible.”\n\n\n “Ahh, there’s more and more issues popping up. Well, do your best to talk it out with him.”\n\n\n For the time being, it seems like I’ll be doing my job as a soldier while being trained as a merchant on the side. Even so, I was happy that I would be able to return to being a merchant and work to support Corinna from within the store.\n\n\n “It’s necessary to have people around who would be able to support Corinna while she’s pregnant. It would be troublesome if you, as her husband, weren’t able to act as her pillar of support.”\n\n\n “Eh? Then that means… the reason Corinna was feeling under the weather was…”\n\n\n I turned to Corinna and started trembling in joy. I raised my fist into the air and shouted.\n\n\n “Oh yeaah! Is the child going to be a boy? A girl? I want a daughter who looks like Corinna. What should we name her?”\n\n\n I was so happy about Corinna’s pregnancy that nothing else was registering in my brain. All of my worries from earlier had been completely blown away. I’m going to be a dad! Daddy is going to work hard for the sake of his family!\n\n\n “Otto, calm down. Do you remember what I was talking about?”\n\n\n “Corinna is going to have a kid! I’m going to be a dad!”\n\n\n “Wrong! There’s something more important before that. Quit your job as a soldier and come work at the store! Your training is going to begin! Do you remember everything?!”\n\n\n “Ah? Probably? More importantly, should we celebrate with everyone? I gotta tell the entire city that Corinna is pregnant with my child and have them celebrate together with us.”\n\n\n While my eyes had brightened up and my body language had visibly changed, Benno and Corinna made disgusted expressions.\n\n\n “I didn’t want to tell you because I knew you’d act like this once you knew…”\n\n\n “Nothing can be done about it, right? He had a dangerous look in his eyes today that was just like that time he went on a rampage when he wanted to marry me. I figured it would be safer to just tell him than have him act on any strange delusions. This way we can at least take countermeasures beforehand and keep the situation under control.”\n\n\n Corinna had a troubled look on her face as she sighed deeply.\n\n\n “Otto, you’re banned from telling other people until I give you permission. There’s always the possibility of a miscarriage.”\n\n\n Being lightly glared at by Corinna’s grey eyes, I had no choice but to promise her I wouldn’t tell anyone about it. I made a promise but, I really really want to tell someone! I want to tell all sorts of people! I want to tell everyone in the entire city who I pass by! I want to tell them that I’m going to be a dad. That the cute Corinna is going to give birth to a cute baby. I desperately suppressed my urge to speak, but I couldn’t help my mouth constantly loosening into a smile. If cute and cute were put together, just how cute would my baby look!?\n\n\n “Cheers to Vantole!”\n\n\n We collided our wooden mugs against each other. During work, I was scolded and told countless times to “shape up” and eventually, Captain brought me out to a bar for drinks. I wanted to quickly go back home and hug Corinna, but this was a good opportunity to talk to Captain about my plans to quit being a soldier. I guess it can’t be helped.\n\n\n “Pu~haa, delicious!”\n\n\n Captain poured his behelle down his throat and then looked at me.\n\n\n “…So? What happened?”\n\n\n “Corinna told me not to tell anyone yet, so sorry Captain, I’m gonna have to keep it a secret.”\n\n\n I waved my hand and kept my silence, but Captain (who also happened to be Myne’s dad), went “ahh” and looked like he had come to an understanding.\n\n\n “Hey, congrats on having your first kid.”\n\n\n “Wh-Wh, how’d you know?!”\n\n\n “What else would your wife tell you to keep a secret? Not too hard to guess from that goofy grin of yours, too.”\n\n\n …Was it that obvious? Well, I’ll be damned.\n\n\n The cat was out of the bag in a matter of seconds. But I wasn’t the one who leaked it.\n\n\n …Corinna won’t get angry at me, right?\n\n\n I had such concerns in my mind, but nevertheless, while I consulted Captain with all sorts of important matters, I also ended up listening to him tell me about his own experiences. There aren’t many opportunities to have a heartfelt talk with someone about fatherhood. The common sense I knew was all learned from my travelling merchant father and wasn’t very relevant to the experience of being a father within the city. Benno and Mark also didn’t have any children so it was a valuable experience.\n\n\n “Hey Captain, how did you come up with names for your kids?”"

Though they still turned black when mixed on a plate, it was the best we could do for now.\n\n\n “Phew, that sure took a while…” Heidi sighed, she sounded like a kid who had her plaything snatched away.\n\n\n Honestly, I was more than glad to finally make the ink, but Heidi would digress because she hadn’t been able to find out what made the colour change. Joseph pinched her cheek with a frown.\n\n\n “We’re done making the ink so she won’t be paying for the work anymore. No more messing around.”\n\n\n “Well, since this project was somewhat a success, I have no qualms sponsoring a bit more for your personal research.”\n\n\n Heidi’s face lit up with my proposal while Joseph turned around to stare at me looking baffled.\n\n\n “We will need a more in-depth research if we ever want to make the colours pop out more and to expand our collection of colours. I was running short on time so I had to prioritise completing a few coloured ink first, but it should be fine for you to do your research now.”\n\n\n I wasn’t the type of person who was interested in researching what made the ink colours change, so I wasn’t going to shoot down someone who offered to do it instead.\n\n\n “Thank you so much, Lady Myne.”\n\n\n “Oh no, you’re gonna make her worse!”\n\n\n “Heidi, Joseph, from now on you are both Gutenbergs.”\n\n\n I was bursting with excitement because I was one step closer to fulfilling my dreams with my new Gutenberg comrades. Ink\n\n\n “Huh? What’s a Guten-thing?”\n\n\n “Gutenberg. It is a title given to the very best - no the most sacred and legendary contributions to the making of books. As of now, Johann has been dubbed the Gutenberd of metal letter pieces, Benno is the Gutenberg of plant paper and Lutz, the Gutenberg of book distribution. Ingo also contributed in making the printing press. Now you two will be the Gutenbergs of ink. And it is my responsibility to help out the Gutenbergs who are going to help me fulfill my dreams anyways.”\n\n\n I thumped my chest with pride. Joseph still stared at me in shock while Heidi shouted with glee.\n\n\n “Joseph, she said we’re Gutenbergs! Not only is she going to give us work, but she’s going to pay for the research too! Yipee!”\n\n\n Now that the coloured ink was completed, I didn’t see any problems with letting Heidi do her own research.\n\n\n “Knowing what makes the ink’s colour change will surely be beneficial in the long run, I look forward to your findings.”\n\n\n “Leave it to us!” Heidi cheered.\n\n\n “But don’t get too sidetracked, making the ink still comes first. I will not hesitate to take away the funds if an order isn’t completed on time.”\n\n\n “Yikes!”\n\n\n “You are someone who easily forgets about what their priorities should be when focus too much on your research. It is important that I give you a punishment so that you will commit to your responsibilities,” I gave Heidi a stern warning.\n\n\n “It takes a weirdo to know another, huh? You clearly know how to keep her in check,” Lutz smirked and Joseph quickly cover his mouth to hide his smile. Well he did seem reliable to keep a watch on Heidi.\n\n\n “Now that we’re done with the coloured ink, I would like to move onto the wax stencils.”\n\n\n The next thing on the list was the wax stencil, that was another crucial element if I wanted to continue with mimeograph printing.\n\n\n First off, we needed to make some thin sheets of wax, after that we could use the metal stylus to write down what we want to print on it. These wax stencils will greatly speed up the process, in contrast to using normal stencils that wasted time cutting out the letters or rearranging the letter pieces everytime. The wax stencils would also allow for more detailed drawings and let Wilma’s talent shine out.\n\n\n “Are the stencils we made not good enough?”\n\n\n “They aren’t bad, we can still make picture books with them. Wax stencils are more superior in many areas. Using the metal stylus to write on them would be faster than trying to cut out every letter on a normal stencil, wax stencils will allow us to add more fine details to the drawings too.:\n\n\n The issue was that we needed paper thin enough to see through. Lutz and I had plenty of experience making paper the last two and a half years, but that wasn’t the case for the orphans, who only started less than a year ago. It was easy to make the paper we used for the picture books, but asking them make a thin one would be tough. Furthermore, they were already struggling to do keep up in the Myne Workshop, they found it difficult to take the paper out of the frames and dry them without damage.\n\n\n “If only we could use some trombe wood.”\n\n\n Lutz frowned and crossed his arms together. It was easier to make thin paper with trombe because its fibers were thinner and longer. However, it was too valuable of a resource to make stencils out of.\n\n\n “Using trombe instead of volrin would be too expensive.”\n\n\n “…You’re right.”\n\n\n I entrusted this task of making thinner paper to Lutz and Gil. They had selected a skillful group from the workshop to make thin paper while the others continue to work on the paper for the picture books.\n\n\n Over the last few days, everyone did their best to make the paper and one day I had sudden visit from Lutz in my chambers after lunch.\n\n\n “Myne, Mister Benno has a message for you. He has found you a wax workshop to work with. They are free for a meeting tomorrow afternoon if you’re available.”\n\n\n “Is that so? Great. Now we can get Gil his own diptych.”\n\n\n I asked Dad to make a cover for the diptych like Lutz’s the other night, now we only needed to fill it up with some wax. I also wanted to take this chance to refill my wax too. My diptych was running out of writing space and the available wax was getting too dry to write on. I scraped out the old wax in preparation for tomorrow.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n “Good morning, Benno.”\n\n\n “Morning, let’s go.”\n\n\n Benno carried me up and onto his shoulders and we made our way down to the workshop. At this height I could see Lutz and Gil jogging up to keep up. Gil clutched the half-finished diptych close to his chest.\n\n\n Damuel was uncomfortable letting Benno carry me, but he quickly let it go because he came to realise that I would never be able to keep up with Benno’s pace. He quickly followed after us and kept to Benno’s speed.\n\n\n “Benno, if by any chance, I knew how to make wax that doesn’t smell, do you think I could sell it?”\n\n\n I took advantage of our journey to the workshop to start a business consultation with Benno. It was best to discuss it now rather than getting yelled at for doing something I shouldn’t have done in future.\n\n\n “Selling that to a guild like what we did with the plant paper ink would be the best. A single workshop isn’t capable enough to handle such a major project.”\n\n\n “Ah, I understand.”\n\n\n Apparently making deals like this required lots of money, it would appear that I would have to pay for all the research and other process for all my Gutenbergs. I tried running a simulation in my head of how the negotiations would go, but that was interrupted by Benno’s voice.\n\n\n “Leave the business negotiations to me. It would not be wise to put yourself in the spotlight. We don’t know if someone like Wolf would be there.”\n\n\n “Alright…”\n\n\n I would let Benno take charge of the negotiations in future, and we would discuss our share of the profits later.\n\n\n “If we are not going to do any business negotiations today, why are we even going to the wax workshop?”\n\n\n “I would like to get Gil’s and my diptych refilled. I also need to get some wax.”\n\n\n “You’re just shopping today?” Benno asked and I nodded back.\n\n\n I wanted to see if there were any existing wax in this world that could be used to make wax stencils. It would be great if we could find one. Otherwise, we would need to make a new type of wax.\n\n\n “I was hoping that we could get some wax to make wax stencils. If they aren’t usable I would like to get the workshop’s help to make one. I would like them to add more pine resin make a stickier type.:\n\n\n Typically, mimeograph wax stencils used pine resin or paraffin, but there was no way we could distill paraffin from crude petroleum in this would. I was beginning to see some limitations to my knowledge here. After that whole mess with the coloured ink, I was expecting something weird to happen to the wax. This time I wanted to seek a professional’s help.\n\n\n “Well alright, we’ll just be patrons today. We’ll only need to start business discussions if the wax doesn’t work, right?”\n\n\n “Yep.”\n\n\n Benno walked into the workshop first and I trailed behind. I was smacked right in the face with a heat wave, and the stench of what was probably animal fat clogged my nose. We were promptly greeted by the foreman who was informed in advance of our arrival."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “It’s a pleasure to see you again, Benno. How can I help you today?”\n\n\n “Could I get some of your cheapest wax in these?” I asked while gesturing towards both Gil’s and my diptychs.\n\n\n The foreman still remembered my last visit, he nodded and starting working on it right away,\n\n\n Gil kept staring at the wax with eager eyes. Though he still couldn’t touch the wax because we told him he had to wait for it to hardened, he was already grinning away. He would occasionally try to blow out puffs of air onto the wax in attempts to speed up the hardening. That was quite adorable.\n\n\n “Gil, if you keep blowing on it, the surface won’t be smooth after it hardens.” Gil jerked when he heard me speak and turned his head towards me.\n\n\n “Yes, you should listen to her,” Lutz commented,” she kept touching hers that it was full of bumps after it dried.”\n\n\n “Shut it, Lutz!”\n\n\n I was furious at Lutz for exposing all my secrets, which made Gil back away from his diptych and lurched forward laughing. Gil probably didn’t want to mess up him diptych like I did.\n\n\n “Oi, Benno. Don’t tell me you went out of the way to contact us just for this? You’re planning to get something else, right?,” the foreman asked Benno after packing away his tools.\n\n\n Benno nodded and replied,“Yeah. I want a small box of every kind of wax you sell here.”\n\n\n “Every one of them? Aren’t you going to place an order for candles?”\n\n\n “Don’t mess up the order. We’re ordering wax, not candles this time.”\n\n\n The foreman looked absolutely shocked by what Benno said. After all the owner of one of the largest stores in town, who always ordered candles of a specific size and amount was now sending in an order for every wax. It was natural for him to be surprised.\n\n\n “Why do you even require the wax for?”\n\n\n “Ah, that’s confidential,” Benno smirked, which provoked the foreman into deep thinking.\n\n\n He was aware that Benno had been pushing out new products one after another, so he was curious if he was up to another.\n\n\n “Deal. We’ll have them delivered tomorrow.”\n\n\n “Would it be alright for us to get a sample of what’s already available here?”\n\n\n “Sure, I’ll get them for you now.”\n\n\n The foreman left to speak with his workers and returned with two boxes of wax. We left the workshop right after that.\n\n\n “Well then, you have everything you need now, right?”\n\n\n “Yep. Thanks, Benno.”\n\n\n When we got back to the Gilberta Company, I tapped my card with Benno’s to return him the cost of the wax. After that I have him the recipe to the paper and discussed a deal for having him handle the negotiation. We also agreed that Benno would handle discussions with the wax workshop on my behalf too.\n\n\n “Alright, we’ll start work when we get back to the workshop,” I instructed Gil as I handed him the wax.\n\n\n Lutz’s expression turned thorny and he held me back with his hand.\n\n\n “Hold on, Myne. What do you mean? What are we going to do? You still haven’t told us what we need to do. Update us before returning to the temple.”\n\n\n It was forbidden for me to do any work in the temple, so I had to give them my instructions first. My initial idea was to do the work in my chambers, but it be wiser to discuss the details at Gilberta Company if I didn’t want others learning about this. I agreed to Lutz’s suggestion.\n\n\n “We’re going to apply a thin layer of wax on the thin paper we’ve already made. We only need to sprinkle pieces of wax onto the paper and melt it down with an iron. And tadah! Simple, right?”\n\n\n “Myne, what’s an ron? And where do we find one?”\n\n\n Lutz was absolutely befuddled by my dumbed down explanation. He seemed to not understand what ironing meant.\n\n\n I sifted through my memory and did my best to describe it.\n\n\n “Uh… It’s just a lunk of metal with a flat surface on the bottom that gets really hot. It’s supposed to iron out the wrinkles on cloth. Is there something like that? They are probably quite common in clothing workshops or among the rich.”\n\n\n I recalled how my robes, that Corinna made, were wrinkle free, so they probably did exist. Benno chirped in.\n\n\n “Yea, Corinna has one in her workshop. You need it?”\n\n\n Benno explained that the irons the rich and clothing workshop had resembled large pots which they filled with hot charcoal. It was similar to the charcoal iron from my old world. Of course my family didn’t have one since we wore old and shabby clothes, Lutz was the same too.\n\n\n “Benno, does the Gilberta Company sell irons?”\n\n\n “Unfortunately, no, they have to be specially ordered from a smithy. It’s not a common everyday item, and no one needs that many anyways. But I have to say… irons are a disaster if you’re not good at them. Are you sure you want one?”\n\n\n It turns out that the ash would spill out these irons and cause a huge mess if you weren’t careful. Honestly, I wanted an electronic one right now, but I didn’t have enough knowledge to make one.\n\n\n “Well, I’ll see if I can make a better version and have Johann make it.”\n\n\n I wouldn’t be getting an iron anytime soon, which put me in a slump. Lutz felt the same and crossed his arms whilst deep in thought.\n\n\n “We already have the drive and knowledge to go, but not the right resources. This whole situation feels familiar. Myne, think carefully, do we have everything we need?” Lutz enunciated his words slowly. He seemed to have recalled how much we struggled the first time we made paper because we had the wrong tools. I cupped my face with my hand, trying my best to recall everything about making wax paper.\n\n\n “Hm… We first need to shave the wax and scatter the bits onto the paper. We can easily do this step with a steeper from those teapots at the market. After that, we’ll…”\n\n\n My words trailed off and jerked in realisation.\n\n\n Lutz is right. I forgot an essential item.\n\n\n I dropped onto the ground and grabbed my head.\n\n\n “NOO!!! We’re missing the cooking sheets!”\n\n\n “Wuah?! What?”\n\n\n I assumed that this method would be the easiest, but we didn’t have any cooking sheets. And we couldn’t make anyway right now, or that I didn’t know the formula behidn it.\n\n\n “…It’s over.”\n\n\n “Why don’t you try thinking it over again? Don’t give up this easily. Is there something else that can be used as a substitute?” Lutz asked.\n\n\n I drew my eyebrows together. Before cooking sheets came around, aluminum foil and paraffin paper existed. But both weren’t an option. Aluminum foil gets wrinkles that would crease the wax, and paraffin paper was basically a paper coated with wax, which was precisely what we were trying to make right now.\n\n\n “Hmm, it’s supposed to prevent the wax from sticking all over when it melts, but a normal paper might get the work done too, right. I hope I’m not getting my hopes too high. How does that sound, Lutz?”\n\n\n When I was still Urano, a normal sheet of blank paper could typically be used to cover the wax, so the paper here might now work too. Well, I hope so.\n\n\n “Don’t ask me, I don’t know anything about this. Do you need any other tools?”\n\n\n “We pretty much have everything else covered to make the wax paper. But I would like to see if we can get a mimeograph stylus and a cutter made as a stencil.” (Note: I’m not sure if I got the tools’ name right)\n\n\n Making wax paper was a very succinct process. We only need to melt and dry the wax on the paper. Getting some wax stuck on the iron wasn’t the most concerning issue, it was weather the wax paper could be used to make stencils.\n\n\n “A stylus and a cutter… Will Johann be making them?”\n\n\n “Yep. That’s in his line of expertise.”\n\n\n I got back up and nodded. Benno cracked a smile at this.\n\n\n “I’m starting to feel bad for all the Gutenbergs.”\n\n\n “Benno, you’re a Gutenberg too. Johann isn’t the only one. Why do you keep thinking you’re not one too huh?” I provoked Benno and that quickly turned his smile upside down. He grabbed my hand and let out a harsh voice.\n\n\n “Everyone who you have dubbed Gutenberg is suffocating with all the work you’ve given them. Is this how you should be speaking to those who have been working hard in your stead all day, every day?”\n\n\n “Wha? Uh… Well…” I stumbled and looked back and forth from Benno to Lutz. I couldn’t think of a reply.\n\n\n I could feel the daggers in their glare poking at me, they were waiting for my response. They weren’t giving me clues of what I should say.\n\n\n ‘Let’s do our best to spread the joy of books across the world?’\n\n\n “That’s not it! Give us your thanks!” Benno yelled out and drilled his fist onto my head.\n\n\n “Thank you! Thank you! It’s thank to you and Lutz that I am able to do all these!. Thank you for staying with me throughout all the hardships I have given you both!”I roared out with tears in my eyes.\n\n\n Benno was trying to make me feel guilty for overworking all the Gutenbergs, but my time with Kamil was too short. I was not going to delay making the picture books by a second, I was even considering turning it up a notch.\n\n\n Johann seemed like he wanted to do anything else but make letter pieces when we last visited to get Gil’s stylus. This time I gave him some drawings of the iron, mimeograph stylus and cutter we will be needing. When he realised that all of them were going to be used for printing, he finally reached the understanding that was going to be a true Gutenberg. So much so that he yelled out in joy."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Johann took down my order for the tools to make the wax stencils, and we agreed on the deadline. It seemed like Wilma’s art for the next picture book would be ready before the tools. This time the book will be set on the coming of spring, centering around Goddess of Water Flutrane and her twelve attendant goddesses\n\n\n “Lutz, since the tools will take some time, should we start our plans for the next picture book?”\n\n\n Wilma was already working on the art even before we finished making the coloured ink, so we had made the stencils for drawings in black and white. In other words, we had planned to just produce books in black and white.\n\n\n Black and white paintings could be completed with simple stencils, so we didn’t have to wait for the tools to be made. Though our paper supply was a little low since we just resumed production in spring, we could purchase the rest from Benno’s plant paper workshops.\n\n\n “Now that we have a printing press, I can use it to—”\n\n\n “Hold your horses, please remember what the High Priest said. You aren’t allowed to use the press, just focus on cutting out the stencils.” Lutz wasn’t going to let me have my way. I gave in with a sigh and went back to cutting.\n\n\n It was such a shame that I couldn’t do any work after going the mile to make the metal letter pieces and the printing press.\n\n\n “There are other stuff you could do instead of insisting on using the printing press that you were told not to use, right? You need to tell Fran and High Priest that the coloured ink is done, as well as Wilma so that she can prepare the art needed for your next book. She will need time to think about what to draw so that it will accommodate to the new print.”\n\n\n “I guess so. I haven’t found the time to have a proper discussion with Wilma because she’s been too preoccupied with Dirk. I should try to meet her tomorrow afternoon at the orphanage.”\n\n\n While Lutz and I continued chatting, I noticed a mother piggybacking her child which made me recall something. I dug through my basket and took out a little pouch with two wooden cups that had some stones inside. Dad helped to carve the cups and I made sure the stones were well cleaned.\n\n\n “Lutz, do you mind putting the stones inside these cups before sealing them?”\n\n\n “…Alright, but can I ask what for?” Lutz looked utterly bamboozled that I had handed him something he had never seen before. The two cups looked the same, with the stones inside, they would serve as rattles.\n\n\n “These are toys for babies, one’s for Kamil and the other for Dirk. Whenever you shake them, they’ll make a rattling sound.”\n\n\n “Oh, I know what you’re talking about, but the ones I know look different.”\n\n\n “I want to colour them so that they’ll look prettier, but putting ink on something a baby might put in their mouth doesn’t sound safe.”\n\n\n Young babies like Kamil and Dirk still couldn’t see colours well, so I thought of dying the rattles to a bright red. But I didn’t feel comfortable letting a baby have something with ink on it. Though I could try using edible ink, there was still the issue of bacteria in the ink.\n\n\n “I don’t think the rattles will last that long anyways. We could try using the ink made from edible stuff. The ink serves no other use other than printing, might as well use them after all that effort. And we aren’t going to use them anytime soon.”\n\n\n “Alright then. Could you help me with them then, Lutz?”\n\n\n “No problem, I’ll return them to you in the afternoon.”\n\n\n We separated at the door to the workshop and returned to my chambers. I was greeted by Rosina who was waiting for me with her harspiel.\n\n\n “Good morning, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n I responded to her enthusiastic greeting with a bewildered smile. I spoke to Delia who was playing with Dirk.\n\n\n “Delia, may I have some of your time? I would like to change my clothes.”\n\n\n “As you wish. Dirk, stay still, alright? I’ll be back as soon as possible.”\n\n\n It took Delia everything to tear herself away from Dirk, after which she quickly helped me with my clothes. She slipped on my blue shrine maiden clothes faster than she ever did, and ran back to Dirk after tying on my sash.\n\n\n “I have returned, Dirk,” Delia spoke to Dirk with a gentle and fawning look that I had never seen on her before. She was totally obsessed with Dirk.\n\n\n …What am I seeing? She’s never smiled like that before.\n\n\n Delia was already a beauty, so her smile absolutely blew me away. Seeing her eyes filled with so much adoration for Dirk made me a little jealous.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, I think Dirk’s ready to roll over by himself soon. He’s truly my little boy, he’s great at everything he does.”\n\n\n Delia plopped onto the ground next to Dirk, she patted his head as he did his best to roll over. She was totally absorbed with his role as his sister. It hasn’t been ten days since Dirk’s arrival at the temple, but it already felt like they were blood siblings.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, Delia will look after Dirk, we should start our harspiel lesson.”\n\n\n With Rosina’s words, I took up my harspiel that was smaller and began practice. I was in the midst of a piece I was learning for the last few days when the door opened. The orphanage was done with breakfast and the children were in the workshop so Wilma came over to pick up Dirk.\n\n\n “Good morning, Sister Myne. I am here to pick up Dirk.”\n\n\n “Good morning Wilma. Thank you for doing all this. Since you are here, I should tell you that I will be at the orphanage this afternoon to update you on the picture books.”\n\n\n Wilma responded to my arrangements with a nod of her head before turning to talk to Delia about Dirk. She asked her about his night and how much goat milk he had so that she would know how much milk to prepare for his next meal.\n\n\n “The situation is looking gloomy without any gray shrine maidens with experience with child-rearing. If we don’t figure out what to do with babies offered to the temple, the orphanage will lose its purpose.\n\n\n The orphanage did not have any gray shrine maidens who could look after the newborns. Knowing how these children came about, it would be better off not letting these gray shrine maidens getting pregnant. The High Priest needed to know about the situation in the orphanage. It would be too demanding to let my attendants look after all the future babies in the orphanage.\n\n\n “I feel so lonely whenever Dirk isn’t around,” Delia mourned as she unwilling handed Dirk over to Wilma.\n\n\n Delia’s face always turned sour whenever Dirk was carried away to the orphanage. Though this made her gloomy and depressed, Rosina, on the other hand, would look relieved. Their reactions were completely different.\n\n\n After my haspiel practice, the third bell had struck, Fran and I made our way to the High Priest’s room to help him with his duties until lunch. After lunch, Fran and Rosina returned to their rooms to rest. Their complexions had improved with the daily afternoon naps, but I could still see that they were exhausted.\n\n\n “Take plenty of rest, the both of you.”\n\n\n “Pardon our absence.”\n\n\n Without Fran and Rosina, Delia was the only attendant on duty. She was done with the cleaning and was in the midst of practicing some arithmetic. I took the time to carve out some stencils while waiting for Lutz. He must have finished his lunch quick because it didn’t take long for him to return from the Gilberta Company with the completed baby toys.\n\n\n “Hey, Myne. The toys are done.”\n\n\n “Sweet! Thanks.”\n\n\n The deep red rattles made a crackling-like sound when Lutz shook them. I couldn’t wait to give them to the babies and see their reactions. I didn’t think Kamil would be able to appreciate the toys yet because of his age, so I wanted to see Dirk’s reaction first.\n\n\n “I told Mister Benno that we would like to purchase some paper from him. He said that they’ll be ready when we start printing.”\n\n\n “You’re so efficient, Lutz.”\n\n\n “No way, I still have lots to work on. Mark keeps nagging that I spend too much time and energy on everything I do.”\n\n\n Mark seemed to be an outstanding mentor, thought Lutz kept putting himself down by saying that he couldn’t hold a candle to Mark, Benno or Leon, he was doing exceptionally well for someone his age.\n\n\n “Myne, remember to get the stencils Wilma made. While you’re busy with that, I’ll make sure the workshop gets all its tools ready for printing”\n\n\n “Don’t worry, I got this.”\n\n\n Lutz and I parted ways again. I packed one of the rattles into my basket and carried the other with me as I made my way down to the first floor hall to find Damuel.\n\n\n “Sir Damuel, I need to head down to the orphanage.”\n\n\n “As you wish, Sister Myne,” he responded. I took quick strides towards Damuel who was holding the door for me, but I stopped dead in my tracks when he turned around with a furious look."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Excuse me, apprentice, but where are your attendants? You can’t walk around without one right?”\n\n\n “…Huh?”\n\n\n I assumed that I didn’t need one since Damuel would be escorting me, but supposedly a bodyguard was not the appropriate choice. It would be uncouth for a lady to not have an attendant so I had to turn to my last resort.\n\n\n “Delia, I need to meet Wilma in the orphanage. I will need you to escort me.”\n\n\n “But Sister Myne…” Delia didn’t finish her words as her face drained off colour and she pursed her lip with a frustrated look. I could tell she didn’t want to accompany me but couldn’t reject me due to our positions.\n\n\n By now I would have backed down because I didn’t want to force Delia into doing something she didn’t want, but I couldn’t do that with a knight like Damuel pressing me.\n\n\n “I only need you to escort me to the entrance to the orphanage. That should be good with you, right? To make it easier on you, Wilma can walk me back here.”\n\n\n “…As you wish.”\n\n\n Delia walked in the front of us with her shoulders hunched. I was walking in the back but I could tell her whole body was stiff and her step was unstable. Though I couldn’t see her face, I was already picturing her sorrowful expression. Delia stopped right at the entrance to the orphanage.\n\n\n “Alright, I’ll take my leave now.”\n\n\n “Not yet, attendant. Open the door first. Are you going to make the apprentice, your mistress, open the door for herself?”\n\n\n Damuel berated Delia just as she was about to leave. I was not allowed to open the door myself, and a knight couldn’t do so too, that was why attendants were needed to do such work.\n\n\n Upon hearing that she had to open the door, Delia’s face completely froze and all the blood drained from her face. But she did her best to seem unaffected and walked towards the door. She closed her eyes shut and clenched her jaw and reached for the door with her trembling hands.\n\n\n The door creaked open. The door lead to the orphanage’s dining hall so the place was lined with rows of long tables. At the end of the dining hall laid a large cushion with Dirk on top of it. He was encircled by a group of gray shrine maidens and they all looked towards us when they heard the door open. They turned away from Dirk and knelt down with their arms crossed to greet me.\n\n\n “I shall take my leave now, Sister Myne,” Delia muttered with her head down so she didn’t see inside the orphanage.\n\n\n “Please do. I apologise for having made you do something you’re uncomfortable with. I give you my thanks, Delia.”\n\n\n “You’re welcome.”\n\n\n Delia swept her gaze across Dirk just before she turned around, but her eyes went wide and she whipped back around, sprinting right to the end of the dining hall.\n\n\n “Dirk!”\n\n\n He was close to completely turning over himself as half of him was hanging out the cushion, but he would have fallen off if he continued to roll over. Delia reached out to catch Dirk right before he fell off the cushion.\n\n\n “Hey! What are you doing?! Dirk almost fell off! He could have gotten hurt! You’re supposed to look after him!” Delia was burning with rage and she carefully placed Dirk back onto the cushion.\n\n\n She was yelling at the gray shrine maidens with good intentions but they were not entirely at fault because they had to keep their heads down when greeting a blue shrine maiden. I shook my head in amusement at Delia’s obsession with Dirk.\n\n\n “…Since you’re already in the orphanage, why don’t you stay here and continue looking after Dirk?”\n\n\n “AH!” Delia’s eyes and mouth went wide open when she realised where she was. She shot right up and I took the chance to place the rattle I was carrying into her hands.\n\n\n “This is a toy that rattles. I was planning to personally give it to Dirk, how about you do it instead? He’ll be happier to receive it from you than me.”\n\n\n Delia looked down at the red rattle and her eyebrows knitted together.\n\n\n “He can probably see the colour red clearly now. Or should I give it to him instead? But he would probably prefer to have his older sister do so, maybe…”\n\n\n I was about to take the rattle back from Delia but she tightened her grip around it and raised it high up so I couldn’t reach it.\n\n\n “I’ll leave it to you, then. Wilma, can I talk to you? Everyone else, please continue with your work.”\n\n\n Wilma and I sat at one of the tables behind Dirk’s cushion, after which the gray shrine maidens who were kneeling on the floor went back to work.\n\n\n “Dirk, look, it’s a toy from Sister Myne. How does it look?” Delia whispered to Dirk as she shook the rattle in front of him. Dirk’s eyes were glued onto the rattle, the colour and the sound was drawing his attention. .\n\n\n I wanted to see Dirk’s reaction so that I could predict how Kamil would react to it too. Seeing that Dirk was amused by the toy relieved me, Kamil would probably like the rattle too.\n\n\n “Wow, he’s really looking at it,” one of the shrine maidens commented.\n\n\n “Do you think he would like music too?” someone else said.\n\n\n The shrine maidens were extremely absorbed at the sight of Delia playing with Dirk because they were not experienced with babies. That was when Delia realised that she was outside and others could hear her. She jumped back up and turned towards me with flushed cheeks.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, I will take my leave now! Everyone, please look after Dirk.”\n\n\n Delia handed the rattle over to a shrine maiden who was standing behind her and ran out of the orphanage. This was the first time she stepped back into the orphanage, and I was pretty sure she would be coming back here more frequently, she was gradually overcoming her fear like Wilma.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, do you think Delia is fine? I am sure she is still suffering from her past in the orphanage,” Wilma asked with a worrisome face as she watched Delia leave.\n\n\n “…Well. She’ll probably be fine as long as Dirk stays around here. She believes she still hates the orphanage because of her memories in here, but the cellar looks completely different now.”\n\n\n Delia had been stuck in that old musky cellar for most her life before she was taken in by the Bishop after her baptism. In her memories, the cellar was a dark and horrible place. After becoming my attendant, she had only passed by the orphanage a handful of times. Delia needed to spend more time here to realise that the orphanage was a different place now. She could start off with getting used to the dining hall first. Moreover, she needed to get comfortable with visiting the orphanage if she wanted to see Dirk. Dirk would be moved to the rooms for pre-baptised children when he stops crying at night.\n\n\n “I really want her to stay together with her cute brother,” I said.\n\n\n “Every time I visit your chambers to fetch Dirk, Delia always tries to hold onto him as possible with such a sorrowful look. I always feel as though I’m committing a crime by taking him away. I sincerely wish for them to stay together, so it’s best that Delia gets used to to the orphanage soon.” Wilma gave a melancholic smile but she didn’t look exhausted like Fran and Rosina.\n\n\n “You don’t look tired, Wilma. Is that because the others here have been helping you?”\n\n\n “Dirk is only in my care during the day, and the others do help me too. Rosina and Fran have to look after him throughout the night by themselves, right? That must be tough.”\n\n\n Though Wilma only had to look after Dirk in the day, the other children were jealous of that and started acting like babies too. They would ask her to stay with them whenever it was bedtime.\n\n\n “You really are the mother of the orphanage, Wilma. It’s been tough on you, having to look after these many children.”\n\n\n “I still have memories of my mother looking after me in the cellar before I got baptised, so i want to do the same for these children who have lost their own mother. There’s nothing better than having the kids treat me like their mother,” Wilma cracked into a smile as she thought about the small kids. Seeing her this way made me truly thankful that I had placed her in charge of the orphanage.\n\n\n We moved on from talking about Delia to the topic of picture books. I told Wilma that we needed the stencils soon as we would be starting production of the new picture books. Next, I informed her that the coloured ink was ready and that we would be incorporating it into future picture books. We would still be printing the same images, so we would need new stencils for coloured ones. After all that, I told Wilma that she could start drawing more detailed art once the wax stencils were done.\n\n\n “You really love books, Sister Myne. It’s amazing how you keep inventing new products to make them… I will make sure I make the best drawings for you.”\n\n\n “Thank you, Wilma.”\n\n\n Right when we finished our talk and that I had taken the stencils Wilma completed did Dirk get hungry. He was wailing for food and the gray shrine maidens moved instantly to prepare the goat milk before Wilma said anything. They were all used to doing this without Wilma’s help by now. I should take the opportunity to return to my chambers now, I didn’t want to trouble them by staying around because they hand to be mindful of their actions when I was present.\n\n\n “I know that it’s hard on you, but I hope that you can continue looking after Dirk. Wilma, will you escort me back to my chambers?”\n\n\n I returned to my chambers after exchanging a few words with the gray shrine maidens."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n I was hit by the shockwave of Delia’s shouting “Geez!” when I reeturned to my chambers. Wilma exchanged befuddled looks. Delia was always happy ever since Dirk appeared in her life, so it had been a while since we last heard her this furious.\n\n\n “So you heard Delia too.”\n\n\n “What’s going on?”\n\n\n “Let’s go in, apprentice,” Damuel said with a cautious look. I quickly walked into my chambers and saw that Fran and Delia were arguing.\n\n\n “You can’t trust the High Priest!”\n\n\n “Yes, we can.”\n\n\n This didn’t feel like a two-way fight, but more of Delia grinding her teeth at him. This was such a weird combination that my eyes grew wide with surprise.\n\n\n “Fran, Delia, what is the matter?” I asked.\n\n\n That was when they had noticed my return. Fran made a shocked expression and quickly apologised to me.\n\n\n “Welcome, back Sister Myne. I apologise for letting you see this.”\n\n\n Fran had quickly went back to his professional attitude, but Delia was still furious and she ran up to me yelling, “Sister Myne! What on earth is he talking about?!”\n\n\n I was confused with what she was referring to.\n\n\n “Uh, what do you mean?”\n\n\n “Delia! You are not to be disrespectful to your mistress,” Fran berated Delia, but she ignored him and shook me by my shoulders.\n\n\n “I want to know what you mean that Dirk is going to be adopted!”\n\n\n “Delia, I’ve said this countless times, Arno mentioned that that will not be happening. Stop bothering Sister Myne.”\n\n\n Fran pulled Delia way from me whilst maintaining a calm facade. I was still confused with what she was talking about. I didn’t know anything about this too.\n\n\n …Is anyone… going to… explain?\n\n\n It turns out that Wilma was befuddled by this situation too, she just started at Fran and Delia wide-eyed.\n\n\n Uhm, what does one do in this situation? Ah yes, yes, I need to get both of their perspectives.\n\n\n I recalled the advise the High Priest had given me, which helped me to better handle this situation. I took a deep break and addressed Wilma first.\n\n\n “Wilma, I appreciate you taking time out of your schedule to escort me back. You are free to return now. It wouldn’t be good if something happens in the orphanage if you stay away any longer.”\n\n\n “Yes, Sister Myne,” Wilma gave her goodbyes. She proceeded to walk out but kept looking back at Fran and Delia on the way out.\n\n\n “Sister Myne!”\n\n\n “I will continue speaking to both of you upstairs. Delia, please make some tea first.”\n\n\n I made my way upstairs with Fran while Delia left to boil some water for the tea, hopefully, giving her something to do would help calm her nerves. We met Rosina on the second floor, she was looking at the harspiel with droopy eyes. When she saw me, she stumbled a little as she got up to greet me.\n\n\n “Rosina, what’s going on?”\n\n\n “I do not know. Delia woke me up, but I don’t recall what she said.”\n\n\n Rosina woke up from her nap because of Delia’s yelling. Rosina’s words had a harsh undertone, which revealed her annoyance at this situation even though she didn’t express it on her face.\n\n\n “Rosina, feel free to rest a little longer in your room.”\n\n\n “Thank you, Sister Myne.”\n\n\n Rosina stumbled back into her room while I sat in the chair Fran pulled out for me. I was planning to hear his side of the story first.\n\n\n “Pardon me, but I couldn’t quite understand what’s going on. Would you kindly explain the details to me, Fran?”\n\n\n “Delia ran into Arno on the way back from the orphanage. Arno was on his way here with a message from the High Priest, so they walked here together. I was still resting in my room when Delia yelled for me and I came out to meet him.”\n\n\n Fran, just like Rosina, had been abruptly awaken by Delia, but he was made to meet Arno and listen to Delia’s yelling. If I had been there, I could have met Arno instead.\n\n\n “I apologise that I was not present to help.”\n\n\n “Please don’t apologise, Sister Myne,” Fran shook his head. “Even if you were around, I would very much like to be present when Arno is passing a message along.”\n\n\n It seemed that he felt like it was his responsibility to hear any messages from the High Priest, regardless if I was around or not.\n\n\n “I could have easily handled Arno who needed to pass on a message. Delia’s sudden outburst was what caught me off guard.” Fran turned his head towards the kitchen and sighed. I had never seen Fran this exasperated before, which goes to show how far Delia had gone today.\n\n\n “What did Arno say anyways?”\n\n\n “The High Priest tried to look for someone to adopt Dirk, but it wasn’t successful just as predicted.”\n\n\n Fran told me that the High Priest tried to find someone who could adopt Dirk after my request. Arno came over to pass the message; even though they couldn’t find a potential parent yet, there was still some hope and that we should continue caring for him in the orphanage.\n\n\n I was give up on this when the High Priest told me that baby boys were unpopular choices in adoption. Instead, I was planning to conjure up a contract with Dirk when I get adopted by a noble.\n\n\n It was painful for me to admit this, but I kind of forgot that I had asked the High Priest to search for someone to take in Dirk.\n\n\n Well, I’m really too blunt.\n\n\n I was taken aback by everything Fran said. Apparently Delia had heard everything he said while she was carrying the tea over. She slammed the tray of cups onto the table and glared at Fran with daggers in her eyes.\n\n\n “Why is the High Priest the one searching for someone to adopt Dirk anyways?!”\n\n\n Recalling how Fran explained himself, it was apparent that he and Arno didn’t know that Dirk had the Devouring. And based on my observations, Delia was angry that she was left out of the loop of Dirk’s potential adoption.\n\n\n I shut my eyes in thought. The High Priest advised me to keep the matter of Dirk’s Devouring under the rug. So there was no way for me to tell Delia that we were searching for someone to adopt him and prevent him from dying from his own mana, right?\n\n\n “The High Priest is having fun breaking families apart! He tore Sister Myne away from her family, and he’s trying to do it again with me and Dirk!”\n\n\n “How many times must I say that High Priest isn’t such a person?! There must a logical reasoning behind this.”\n\n\n From Delia’s perspective, she saw the High Preist as a monster who enjoyed breaking apart families. It wasn’t out of place for Fran to get livid when someone he greatly respected was being talked about in such a manner.\n\n\n “Delia,” I puffed out a sigh and took a deep breath before speaking to her again. “We do not have any shrine maidens in the orphanage who can properly care for a baby. As such, I made a request towards the High Priest to seek for someone capable of looking after him, that might be better for him.”\n\n\n I became the next target of Delia’s fury. “What?! Sister Myne was the one who wanted to tear us apart?!”\n\n\n I shocked my head and refuted what she said. “That’s not it. Do you not recall how you were initially against looking after Dirk? I did it because I thought no one would want to care for him.”\n\n\n I could tell that Delia remembered what she said in the past because her expression froze and she stumbled on her words. “T-that… was only on his first day here.”\n\n\n “Yes, and that was the same day that I went to talk to the High Priest about it.”\n\n\n Delia didn’t say anything else as her rage simmered down.\n\n\n “We do not have any experienced nursing gray shrine maidens, and we too, are not well-equipped to look after him. Since no wet nurses want to step foot in the temple, we have Fran and Rosina looking after him at night, which is taking a toll on them. I believed that it was in everyone’s best interest that I find someone to take him in.”\n\n\n Though Fran and Rosina had the time off in the afternoon to test and Delia volunteered to care for him longer than her shift, the first few days with Dirk were beyond chaotic. Delia was aware of that, so she didn’t argue any further.\n\n\n “I asked the High Priest for help and he did his best to do so. I didn’t set high expectations because he told me in advance that the possibility of finding someone to adopt Dirk was close to zero, but he still did his best.”\n\n\n “… Well, I understand it now,” Delia nodded as all her anger faded away.\n\n\n “I didn’t think you would be this proactive in looking after Dirk, so I’m thankful that we haven’t found anyone to adopt him yet. Anyways, Arno told us that we keep raising him in the orphanage, right?”\n\n\n “That’s right. The High Priest said that we should stay positive about the situation and continue looking after him,” Fran chimed in and Delia looked stunned. She gave me a side glance, as though she was signalling for me to give her the final reassurance.\n\n\n “…So you won’t separate us, right, Sister Myne?”\n\n\n “Definitely not. I know how much Dirk means to you, Delia, and I myself know how difficult it is to be taken away from your family.”\n\n\n “…That’s a relief.” Delia placed her palm against her chest and sighed in relief. “I can’t bear to be separated from Dirk. He’s… He’s the only family member I have…”\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n It took Johann ten days to make the iron. Out of all the products I ordered, this was the first thing to be completed, I guessed it was because it was the easiest to make or maybe because it caught his eye the most. Since the iron was ready, I wanted to give improving the stencils with wax a shot, hopefully we could complete it before next production of picture books. It was alright for the wax to be a little thick because we didn’t have a cutter made yet.\n\n\n “We can print so much more with these!” I lifted up the stencil and yelled out, but Lutz just crossed his arms with a perplexed expression.\n\n\n “…Wait a second, Myne, the High Priest did say to cut back on the printing right? Are you sure we should be ramping up production?”\n\n\n “We can keep reusing the stencils with these wax paper, so we can print so much more.”\n\n\n “Don’t change the subject!” Lutz roared, but I wasn’t going to stop at stencils right now. I had plans to start woodblock printing for books filled with texts, but I needed to improve illustrations first.\n\n\n “This would make work easier for Wilma. Shouldn’t we try to fully utilise these reusable stencils?”\n\n\n Lutz was clearly aware how much time and energy it took Wilma to make the art and cut it out.\n\n\n He frowned and rubbed his temples. “These will only be used for the illustrations, alright?”\n\n\n I only upgraded the stencils for the artwork before giving them to Gil. He was now in charge or all the print work and the gray priests in the workshop.\n\n\n Lutz’s workload had lightened up now that Gil was helping out with managing the workshop. As such, Lutz, Damuel and I could take out time visiting the workshop, Gilberta Company and temple on alternate days. It was almost time for the opening of the Italian restaurant too, with only the door and windows left to complete. Every now and then, I would visit the restaurant with Benno before heading to the ink workshop to stay updated on Heidi’s research.\n\n\n “Myne, you stopped talking. Is there something on your mine?”\n\n\n “Yea, it’s about Kamil.”\n\n\n “Again?”\n\n\n Though I was practically swimming in work, I was always thinking about new toys for Kamil. I heard from the others in the orphanage that Dirk was completely entranced by the wood rattle I gave him, but it always crashed onto his face whenever he tried to hold it and he would burst into tears. I couldn’t bear to hurt Kamil’s cute face, so I needed to make something better.\n\n\n “Lutz, I would like to get some small bells.”\n\n\n “What’s it for?”\n\n\n “I’m planning to make a smaller rattle for him to hold.”\n\n\n Bells were not the only metal things here that made noises, but none of them were small like the bells you would find on an animal collar. It was easy to draw a blueprint of it for Johann but I doubt they were going to make nice jingling sounds.\n\n\n “Alright, time to go to the smithy.”\n\n\n The smithy was a short walk from the ink workshop, so I decided to pay a visit."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Good morning.”\n\n\n “Welcome. Oh look who it is! Gutenberg! Lady Myne is here!” A smith I was unfamiliar with greeted me and shouted Gutenberg with a great big smile. It turns out that using the term Gutenberg here was now a norm. Johann trudged into the lobby of the workshop and muttered under his breath to stop calling him Gutenberg, but no one paid it any attention.\n\n\n “Lady Myne, how can I help you? The styluses are still in work.”\n\n\n I asked Johann to make lots of styluses to be used on the wax paper, so it would take a little longer before he was done with them.\n\n\n “I was thinking to have some apprentices work on these instead. I would like to make some small bells.”\n\n\n I began drawing out the blueprints for the bells as Johann watched on with zest. As I had predicted, Johann had never made such small bells but just those large ones.\n\n\n “Lady Myne, are you going to use these carvings just decorations?”\n\n\n “They are needed to make a certain sound. The carvings here don’t have to be that precise, but please try to make them as close as possible to the drawings. The gaps have to be small too so that the balls inside don’t fall out.”\n\n\n Bells made different sounds depending on the size of the gap on them, as well as the thickness of the metal, size of the ball and the type of metal used. It was unfortunate that I couldn’t remember the extact details. I only knew that the bells were made from putting small metal balls inside a bigger hollow metal case, such that shaking them made a sound. After all that was done, I needed him to put the small bells into another bigger metal case. We needed to put the bells into another case so that the sounds it made would be more prominent when stuffed inside a toy.\n\n\n “…Alright, they seem quite simple. Will you be using these for printing too?”\n\n\n “Nope, they are toys for babies. There are things I wish to order that aren’t printing related too,” I pouted.\n\n\n Johann gave a cheeky smile. “Wow, I never expected to you order something not related to your books or printing. I was sure that your mind was only filled with books,” he said that with some relief.\n\n\n Though my first priority was still Kamil, I was and always am thinking about books. But I wasn’t going to correct Johann’s misunderstanding. I would let him be satisfied with that thought. It was just then that Lutz interrupted.\n\n\n “That’s right. Books are the only thing Myne thinks about. It’s too soon for you to think about running away from your position as Gutenberg.”\n\n\n “You don’t have to tell me. Couldn’t you just humour me this time?” Johann complained sounding a little exasperated. Lutz gave him a consolation pat and told him to get used to me and that there was no escape.\n\n\n “That’s right. Lutz, remember that you’re my first and most commendable Gutenberg,” Lutz’s shoulders dropped just like Johann’s when I said this.\n\n\n What’s wrong? I was only trying to praise him. How odd.\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n “I’ll be heading home right now,” I announced to Damuel outside the smithy. Just then, a flurry of bells rung throughout the entire town, these were the bells signalling an emergency. In the next instant, a beam of red light pierced through the skies from the direction of the east gate. That was the magic tool used to signal for help.\n\n\n Since Damuel was a knight, he was the first to notice the light. He locked his gaze on the red light with a frown and hefted me up into his arms.\n\n\n “We need to go now.”\n\n\n He began sprinting to my house right after he said down. He was sifting through the narrow alleys and roads at breakneck speed now that he had memorised the topography of the entire lower city. Lutz was doing his best to keep up with a confused look on his face.\n\n\n “I am familiar with streets. Lutz, you are free to return home or back to the company. Do whatever you wish,” Damuel spoke up while running. He would usually see me off at the well in the square in front of my house, but this time he brought me up the stairs and knocked the front door.\n\n\n “Yes, who is it— huh?! Myne?!” Mum moved to the side to let Damuel through so that he could put me down. Mum was absolutely befuddled when Damuel kept looking back and forth from me and her. He had a very grave expression.\n\n\n “Something is going on at the east gate, they have sent a signal for the Knight’s Order.”\n\n\n “The east gate?!”\n\n\n “The beacon was a small one, so I do not think it is anything serious. They have probably called the knights to assist on something pertaining to the nobles. As such, I shall stay her until we are fully confident of Myne’s safety.”\n\n\n Mum was still a little taken aback by the arrival of a knight, but she still understood the severity of the situation. “Please protect Myne.”\n\n\n Damuel stood guard at the entrance, ready for any potential danger that could come our way. Kamil started wailing, so Mum went to the bedroom to soothe him, and I took a glass of water to Damuel who was still panting.\n\n\n “Oh. Thank you, apprentice,” Damuel downed the entire glass of water in an instant and tried to calm his nerves. I was just going to be a nuisance if I stayed around him right now, so I went to the storage room. I was looking to see if we had any suitable clothes to make the stuffed animal on the rattle.\n\n\n “We have lots of white cloth, maybe I could make a rabbit?”\n\n\n I chose a few nice looking cloth. After that I sat at the kitchen table and began working on some new stencils. Just then, a white bird that resembled those magical ones burst through the wall towards me. That shocked the life out of me, seeing it appear this unexpectedly, but Damuel didn’t flinch and reached out to receive it. The bird sat on his arm and spoke.\n\n\n “Damuel, you are to return to the Knight’s Order after taking the apprentice shrine maiden back to the temple or her home.”\n\n\n The bird relayed the orders three times with a low male voice before transforming back into a yellow feystone. Damuel made his wand appear out of nowhere like how the High Priest usually did and used it to tap the stone and muttered some phrases. This made the feystone transform back into a white bird.\n\n\n “The apprentice is back at home and is safe. I shall make my way back promptly,” he said and shook his wand which made the bird fly through the wall.\n\n\n “Apprentice. I have to return to the Knight’s Order to receive further instructions. No matter happens, you are not to leave the house until I return. Do you understand?”\n\n\n “Yes.”\n\n\n Damuel warned me again that I not allowed to even step foot into the plaza, after that he made his way down the stairs. I was clueless as to what was going on, but if he had to return to the Knight’s Order, it meant that the situation might be related to me.\n\n\n “Myne, where did the knight go?” Mum had finished feeding Kamil and walked out the bedroom with a worried expression. It seemed like she had felt more secure with having Damuel around.\n\n\n Right now it was just me, Mum and Kamil, so there was no one to help us if a problem were to arise.\n\n\n “There was an order for him to return to the Knight’s Order. If Sir Damuel doesn’t need to be here, it must mean that I am safe, so I doubt that it is anything dangerous or serious,” I said to comfort Mum.\n\n\n Mum smiled a little in relief.\n\n\n “So he left because the problem has been resolved. That’s good to know.”\n\n\n Well we didn’t have to wait for Damuel to return with an explanation because Dad was the one to do that. He had been posted at the east gate this spring and witnessed everything that unfolded today.\n\n\n “Dad, what’s going on?”\n\n\n “Ah, I think it’s probably best for you to know about it too, Myne.”\n\n\n After our dinner, Dad drank his beer and told us, “Some noble from another duchy was causing a ruckus when coming into the city.”\n\n\n It turned out there was an emergency because a noble from outside had tried to force his way in. The High Priest had mentioned this before that as of this spring there would be more stringent rules for nobles moving in and out the city. One such rule made it so that the nobles from other duchies could not enter if they did not receive the archduke’s permission. Previously, the nobles could enter with a letter from a noble from the city, but that was no longer the case. The nobles from Ehrenfest were all aware of this because the archduke had briefed them about it during the winter gathering, but the nobles from other duchies were unaware about this. As so, the noble who was turned away by a commoner guard was overtly livid.\n\n\n “Those in charge must have expected this to happen so they were prepared for the Knight’s Order to take action if things got bad.”\n\n\n “Amazing. The archduke was very thorough about this, huh?”\n\n\n Dad continued explaining that he was the one to use the magic toll from the Knight’s Order to call for help. The tool was primarily made of two pieces. The first piece resembled a hammer with a red stone embedded in to and the other piece was another red stone. To activate the toll, you had to use the hammer-like tool to strike the other stone. Fran had probably used a similar one in the carriage back during the Spring Prayer.\n\n\n Nobles were free to do whatever they wanted to commoners, but things were more complicated if the nobles of the city got involved. The foreign noble had stomped off in rage when the Knight’s Order explained that he needed the archduke’s permission for entry.\n\n\n “Best to let nobles deal with nobles. Frankly, I’m thankful that the knights came to help.”\n\n\n “Even so, he tried to enter with a letter from a noble from Ehrenfest, right? So why did that noble even give him a letter if they were already aware that they needed the archduke’s permission?”\n\n\n “Who knows.”\n\n\n Maybe he gave the letter before spring. I cupped my head and pondered even though though I knew that I couldn’t figure out the answer. Dad turned towards me with a grave expression.\n\n\n “Myne, you have to take extra precaution. Do you still remember the High Priest’s words? You’re at risk of getting kidnapped by nobles from other duchies,” he said and I nodded back.\n\n\n “I will do my best to guard the fate and call for the knights if things get too dangerous with the nobles. Always remember to stay with your bodyguard.”\n\n\n Seeing that Dad was doing his best to protect me made me a little happy. Even though it wasn’t an appropriate thing to do at the moment, I couldn’t help smiling."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Damuel didn’t return for two days. I was told not to leave the house so I had lots of time to spare. I decided to spend the time to brainstorm the contents for my third picture book and sew up the stuffed animal for the rattles with Tuuli. She wanted to give hers to Corinna’s daughter, Renate.\n\n\n “I will give it to her the next time we visit. We will see her soon, right?”\n\n\n “It would be impolite of us to not visit after everything the Gilberta Company has done for us, and Benno did give Kamil a gift when he was born.”\n\n\n I was planning to see Corinna after everything had been settled and the town was safe, Tuuli was looking forward to coming along too. Babies girls were probably cute too and I wanted to see how Otto fawned over his baby girl.\n\n\n “…Ah, this looks bad. Myne’s one looks cuter.”\n\n\n Tuuli compared the two rattles and pouted. Her rattled looked something like a polar bear while mine resembled a little bunny. They looked a little misshapened because we had to stuff them with cloth instead of cotton.\n\n\n “Your better at sewing them together.”\n\n\n My stitching looked bad and messy, but I had to agree with Tuuli that it did look cute. I puffed up my chest in pride at my craft when Tuuli leaned her head over and shook her head.\n\n\n “You’re not going to get married if you don’t improve your sewing.”\n\n\n “Who cares! I only need books in my life.”\n\n\n The ideal wife in this world was someone who was healthy, capable of doing chores and was good at sewing. I didn’t possess any of those qualities so I knew and wasn’t expecting to get married anyways. I would be just like I was as Urano, books would be my only companion in this life. Frankly, I’d rather make and read books forever than get married to someone and be forced to sew clothes for my family.\n\n\n We’re just missing the bells to complete these toys, I sighed to myself. But I was surprised by Lutz’s visit on the third evening of being stuck in the house.\n\n\n “Johann came over to deliver these. What are you going to use them for?” he asked as he rolled the bells around in his hand. They made a soft jiggle as the small balls moved inside.\n\n\n Wow. Johann does it again.\n\n\n “They’re small bells that will be going in these toys. They’ll make jiggling sounds when you shake them.”\n\n\n The bells had to be stuffed together with the toys so that they wouldn’t be ingested by kids. The eyes and mouths were made with thread, I did not sew on extra cloth so that they couldn’t be pulled off. I had left a small hole on the toys so that I could slip the bells in, and Lutz watched me swiftly complete the toy.\n\n\n I shook the toys and they made a cute jingle from the inside.\n\n\n Mission complete.\n\n\n “Kamil, look at this. Do you hear it?”\n\n\n I shook the stuffed rabbit next right at Kamil’s ears which made him blink curiously. He couldn’t raise his head up and look at the toy yet, but I could see his eyes swirling around to figure out where the sound was coming from.\n\n\n “Ah so cute! Kamil’s so cute.” I couldn’t help breaking out into a smile when I saw his reaction to the toy. And in the next second, he broke out crying. It seemed that I had lots to work on becoming the best sister.\n\n\n It took a total of five days before I saw Fran and Damuel again in the morning. They had came together to take me out my house.\n\n\n “Good morning Fran, Sir Damuel.”\n\n\n “Good morning, apprentice.”\n\n\n Damuel nodded his head to acknowledge my greeting and he turned around to address Dad. He was still home since he was only on the afternoon shift today.\n\n\n “Please pardon my intrusion, I am here to escort the apprentice.”\n\n\n “I leave her in your care, sir.” Dad saluted by hitting his chest twice with a first. Damuel returned the gesture with a grim expression before speaking.\n\n\n “Gunther, Lord Ferdinand has a message for you. The archduke has left the city on business and will not be present to grant entry to any nobles at present. There is a chance that you may come across forged passes, take extra precaution. Do you follow?”\n\n\n “Understood, sir!” Dad nodded with a resolved look. My dad always looked so cool whenever he was working.\n\n\n “I’ll get going, see you later, everyone.”\n\n\n “Take care.”\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n Lutz was waiting for us in the square and we walked to the temple together. We were approaching the temple and I saw Fran from a distance and noticed that he had a grim look.\n\n\n “Are you ok, Fran? You’re frowning.”\n\n\n “I will brief you on the situation later. It is something that shouldn’t be discussed out here,” that was all he said before he went silent and pursed his lips.\n\n\n “Everything will be revealed later in the temple, you cannot avoid hearing about it,” Damuel spoke after.\n\n\n I raised my head and saw that he was wearing his noble smile, which was pretty much a poker face. His poker face didn’t reveal provide me any clues on what to expect.\n\n\n “Ok, I’ll get going first,” said Lutz.\n\n\n “Alright, see you.”\n\n\n Just like always, Lutz parted from the group at the front of the workshop and the rest of us walked back to my chambers. I waited and watched Fran open the door for me like a noble lady would, but I was stunned by the stillness in the room.\n\n\n “…It’s feeling awfully quiet in here.”\n\n\n It was quite an awkward tension in the air. If this were like any other day, I would be greeted by Dirk’s crying or Delia playing with him, or the sounds of people shuffling about the room. However, the room was completely still. It was so quiet that I could hear the chefs moving about in the kitchen at the other side of the room. I thought that the room was quiet because Dirk was napping and crept up the stairs.\n\n\n I walked up to the second floor and saw Rosina cleaning the table. The sight of that shocked me because Rosina was so careful with her fingers that she only played music and helped with the paperwork. That was why Delia took charge of lightweight chores.\n\n\n “Good morning Rosina. Is Delia not around? Is she sick today?” I asked and shift my eyes around to search for her.\n\n\n Rosina averted her gaze and set the cloth she was using down onto the table before walking to the closet.\n\n\n “Delia is gone. She has returned back to the High Bishop and took Dirk along with her.\n\n\n “What?”\n\n\n This was such a sudden piece of news that I struggled to understand it. I stared at Rosina with a blank look on my face as she held my robes. I could tell she was struggling to find the words to say. In the end, she just gave me a melancholic smile and said, “Sister Myne, we’ll talk more after you have changed. You will have to change before Fran can come upstairs.”\n\n\n I was assisted into my robes by Rosina, and she waited for me to sit down before ringing a bell. After which, Fran came up the stairs with some tea he brewed and poured it into a cup for me. I took a sip of it, Fran’s tea always tasted good, but this wasn’t the time for tea appreciation. I placed my cup back down and raised my head towards them.\n\n\n Rosina was the first to speak. “It all started yesterday. Fran and I had retreated back to our rooms to nap, but when we woke up, Dirk’s cushion and diapers were missing. Our worries were fueled on when we noticed that Delia was missing too. I went to the orphanage but Dirk was not there too. Wilma said that Delia had taken Dirk as she said that they had some family bonding to do.”\n\n\n Wilma didn’t think too much about it and let her go. She thought that Delia was working hard for Dirk given that she had practically forced herself to enter the orphanage she despised so much to see him. Never would she have ever imagined that my attendant would take him anywhere else but my chambers.\n\n\n “Rosina said the same to me too, so I quickly sought a meeting with the High Priest. I felt that the disappearance of an apprentice’s attendant was an important matter to report, and that a search was needed to be done as soon as possible,” Fran spoke in a hushed voice.\n\n\n I understood why he did that because Delia might have taken away by a blue priest. However, Fran said on his way to meet the High Priest when he saw Delia carrying Dirk, and she was walking next to the High Bishop. He approached her but was stopped by the High Bishop. In the end, he had to ask the High Priest about it.\n\n\n “How could he do that? I understand why Delia would return to the High Bishop since she used to be his attendant, but Dirk has to stay in the orphanage, right?”\n\n\n Just sometime ago, I had been told that Dirk couldn’t be taken out of the orphanage to meet the High Priest, and frankly, the High Bishop looked like someone who called children disgusting and lock them in the orphanage until they were baptised. It was extremely odd that Dirk was seen in the part of the temple for nobles only.\n\n\n That was when Fran revealed, “Dirk has been adopted.”\n\n\n “What?”"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “A noble has adopted Dirk, this was all approved by the High Bishop.”\n\n\n The High Bishop had the authority to approve an adoption without the notifying the orphanage director or the High Priest as long as the adoptee was a commoner.\n\n\n “Is the archduke’s permission not required when it comes to noble adoptions? I heard from Sir Damuel that the archduke isn’t around.”\n\n\n “The High Priest mentioned that the archduke’s approval is not needed if the to-be-parent is a noble from another duchy.”\n\n\n So there was a loophole in the law. Any adopter from beyond the duchy borders only needed the blood stamps of the High Bishop, the adoptive father and the adoptee. In other words, Dirk had been adopted by a noble from another duchy.\n\n\n “…This isn’t a good thing, right?”\n\n\n “No, the High Priest wasn’t happy to hear about it.”\n\n\n Fran crossed his arms over and frowned, he looked just like the High Priest right now. He looked back up to me.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, please fire Delia and cut off all contact from her. We all know that you are a very caring person, but this is unforgivable. She acted all on her own without seeking her mistress’s approval and caused so much havoc too. She cannot stay by your side as an attendant. If she wishes to stays with the High Bishop, she needs to be relieved of her duties.”\n\n\n Delia would continue to stay as my attendant unless I declared her dismissal. Rosina nodded along to say that she found it rude for Delia to approach the High Bishop without a heads up.\n\n\n This wouldn’t have been that much of a shock if it happened right after Delia became my attendant. Just when I felt that we were finally on great terms, I had been stabbed in the back by Delia.\n\n\n Why? I couldn’t stop asking myself.\n\n\n I looked back into my cup of swirling tea before speaking again.\n\n\n “…Delia will be dismissed. Please have her summoned.”\n\n\n Fran stopped frowning, it seemed like he was worried that I couldn’t bear to let her go. His arms were still crossed and he replied with a “as you wish,” before making his way out.\n\n\n I sipped on my tea again after that, but the tea no longer tasted like it did before, it was horribly bitter.\n\n\n Fran came back with Delia behind. Delia had a rather pleasant expression plastered onto her face, which was a stark contrast to Fran’s gloomy face. She strolled over with light steps as her red hair swished around.\n\n\n “Good morning, Sister Myne. You called for me?”\n\n\n She looked just like normal and I could tell that she wasn’t out to get me, in fact she was speaking like nothing had happened that it gave me headache. Her behaviour made me question if she even went to the High Bishop with Dirk. Looking at Fran and Rosina’s stern faces slapped me awake and I shook my head.\n\n\n “I have been informed about your return to the High Bishop.”\n\n\n “That’s right,” Delia’s face lit up so much that it made her entire body glow.\n\n\n “I told the High Bishop that the High Priest was looking for someone to adopt Dirk and had yet to find someone. After hearing about it, the High Bishop found someone right awar! And the adopter is a noble too.That’s amazing, right? Any noble adoptions here take some time to be approved because they have to go through the archduke, so the High Bishop sought someone outside the duchy. He knows so much more people than the High Priest.”\n\n\n “So you and Dirk can continue staying together?”\n\n\n I was worried that Dirk would have been taken to the duchy and that maybe Delia would follow along as his caregiver. Despite all that, it was fishy that the High Bishop had sought someone to adopt Dirk in a way that did not need the archduke’s approval. I had a bad feeling about it.\n\n\n Delia laughed, “Dirk will be under the High BIshop’s care until he is old enough, he’s not an orphan anymore. The High Bishop has bestowed us with a room so that Dirk and I can stay together.”\n\n\n …Why does that sound off?\n\n\n Delia said that Dirk would live in the temple until he came of age, but that would mean that he wouldn’t be allowed to study in the Academy or be able to stay with his new family. Then, why did the noble even go out of the way to adopt Dirk? Even if he was adopted for his mana, why was the High Bishop looking after him? Thinking about it got me even more worried, but Delia continued smiling, completely oblivious to my suspicions.\n\n\n “Now me and Dirk won’t be separated. If Dirk stayed with you, he would have to eventually move into the orphanage.”\n\n\n Delia struggled with entering the orphanage, so to her, Dirk being there and her living in the director’s chambers felt just like being torn apart. No matter what, even if she got used to being in the orphanage, Dirk would be moved to the boy’s hall after he gets baptised which would make it even harded for them to meet. So how could I bear to chastise Delia when she had gone to such lengths to stay with Dirk?\n\n\n “I take it that you both aren’t being mistreated, are you?”\n\n\n “Nope, not at all,” Delia shook her head.\n\n\n For now, the High Bishop was treating Delia nicely. Since she only saw him as a caring old man she wouldn’t take too kindly to me speaking bad of him. I sucked in my breath.\n\n\n “Alright then, you are officially dismissed as my attendant. You will have to return to the High Bishop. Are you sure about this?”\n\n\n “Entirely. Sister Myne, if that is all, I would like to take my leave to see Dirk. His new father should be arriving.”\n\n\n A bitter taste washed over my mouth when I said the words to relieve Delia of her position as my attendant, but Delia didn’t seem bothered at all. She only seemed concerned about leaving so that she could reunite with Dirk again.\n\n\n “I apologise for asking you to come here at this time. I would just like you to know how worried Fran and Rosina were when you and Dirk disappeared without notice. Wilma was absolutely shocked and so was Gil when he learned about it after returning from the workshop. Even I was shaken to learn of it this morning. For all of us to discover Dirk’s and your disappearance, we were all worried about the both of you. I would have appreciated it if you had said something before.”\n\n\n After much deliberation, I finally decided to tell her how I felt, I wanted her to realise the effects of her actions. I could tell that that sent something through Delia, but she tried to smile to cover up her emotions.\n\n\n “…The High Bishop told me that you wouldn’t let me take Dirk away, that was why I decided to take action by myself. I see my mistakes now. I’m sorry,” she apologised and looked away from me as she tried to push the fault onto the High Bishop. It looks like she wasn’t that oblivious to how problematic her actions were.\n\n\n “Anyways, I wish you and Dirk all the best. It won’t be easy looking after him by yourself.”\n\n\n “Thank you. Goodbye, Sister Myne.” Delia gave me a genuine smile before taking her leave. I was happy for her that she was happy now, but I was sure that that joy would be short-lived.\n\n\n When she left the room, I turned around to Fran and Rosina.\n\n\n “…Do you think Delia and Dirk will be alright?”\n\n\n “We cannot do anything for Dirk because he is not an orphan under the temple. This was something Delia decided for him,” Rosina said with a harsh tone.\n\n\n I nodded back with uncertainty, “…I guess so.”\n\n\n But I still wanted to help them with what I could. I started brainstorming ways to help them when Fran knelt beside me. He gently took my hand into his and raised his head to look into my eyes.\n\n\n “Sister Myne, no matter what Delia does or say, you must never agree to meet the High Bishop,” he said. I was confused why he said that, and he continued speaking with a concerned look.\n\n\n “When I went to call Delia over, the High Bishop kept asking for you to head to his chambers instead. I insisted that it was unheard of for a mistress to leave her chambers to fetch her own attendant. He finally agreed to let Delia go, but seeing him that assenting was quite unnerving.”\n\n\n The High Bishop had previously ordered that I was never to set foot into his chambers ever, and he always ignored me. However he was now telling Fran that I should go to him and that I had to meet Delia in his chambers. That sudden change in his attitude towards me concerned Fran, and I agreed that it was strange too.\n\n\n “And it turns out that the High Bishop knows the noble who tried to enter the east gate a few days ago, and he was the one who gave him the letter of introduction too. His name was on the letter and the knights questioned him about it. He brushed it off by saying that it was to strengthen diplomatic relations between the duchies, but the High Priest suspects that he wanted to grant the noble entry into the city so that Dirk could be taken.”\n\n\n “Why did the High Bishop invite the noble into the city without seeking the archduke’s approval first?”\n\n\n “It would seem that he had not been informed of it,” Fran replied.\n\n\n I blinked in confused and he spoke again with a disturbed look.\n\n\n “The High Bishop spends his winter in the temple for the rituals and he doesn’t get invited to the social gatherings because of he isn’t seen as a full-fledged noble. He was completely aware of the new rules implemented.\n\n\n The High Bishop was not exactly a noble so he wasn’t invited to social gatherings for nobles, which the archduke had announced the new changes to the system. That explained why he had invited an outsider noble.\n\n\n “It isn’t clear why the High Bishop had allowed an outsider noble to adopt Dirk and called for Delia to return. Please be more careful from now on,” Fran said and I felt his hands tremble. He was probably worried for me.\n\n\n I squeezed his hands firmly and nodded."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Sister Myne, shall we look for a new attendant now that Delia has been dismissed?”\n\n\n “How soon will we need one?”\n\n\n Winter was over so I was no longer staying in the temple, so I had thought that we weren’t busy enough to need another attendant to resume Delia’s duties.\n\n\n “As soon as possible.”\n\n\n Fran had more time to sleep and help Gil with the physical chores now that he didn’t need to look after Dirk. Rosina didn’t help out with the chores because she didn’t want to hurt her fingers, so Fran urged to find someone to replace Delia as soon as possible.\n\n\n “Pardon my rudeness, we all know that you are quite softhearted and will not stop worrying about Delia. It would put my heart at ease if you find someone else to accompany you which will help you take your mind off Delia.”\n\n\n I didn’t speak back because he had hit it right on the mark. Fran must have noticed how I kept looking across the room to search for Delia. Anyways, Fran was right. I couldn’t let Fran and Rosina keep worrying about me because of Delia. I should care more for those who stayed with me than the one who left.\n\n\n I sighed and dipped my gaze, “…If I had to choose one of the gray shrine maidens, how about Monica and Nikola?”\n\n\n The two helped Ella with the meals last winter. Wilma had praised them for their work so I knew that they were hardworkers that could help with the chores and meal preparations for the kitchen.\n\n\n Furthermore, the italian restaurant was about to be opened so all the chefs except Ella would be leaving. Ella wanted to stay behind to learn more recipes and I already arranged for it to happen with Benno’s permission. I was more than happy to let Ella stay behind since we needed someone to teach the new chefs that Benno was going to send over. Monica and Nikola would also work well with Ella since they already did so last winter.\n\n\n “Monica and Nikola? Sister Myne, would that not be a strain on you?” Fran whispered to me, expressing his worries about my finances.\n\n\n Taking on two new attendants might be quite a financial burden for this season, but it would be already since we had lots of orders for the games we made over the winter, and we would be earning much more if the picture books continued to sell.\n\n\n “They were helped out lots over the winter, right? It wouldn’t be fair if I only chose one of the to be my attendant. Anyways, it would be much better to hire them both.”\n\n\n “Sister Myne, you need not be considerate of the feelings of the gray shrine maidens.”\n\n\n Rosina smiled looking a little confused. However, life in the orphanage and as an attendant was very different. I couldn’t pick one of them with that in mind.\n\n\n “Well working with them would be much better now that Delia is gone,” Fran chimed in.\n\n\n “Shall I bring them over now?”\n\n\n “Yes, please. They are new to the job so it would do us well if they start their training as soon as possible. Fran, could I get you to train them?”\n\n\n I intended to let them adjust to their work before the rest of the staff in the kitchen left for the Italian restaurant. Since Rosina couldn’t bear to hurt her fingers to show them how to clean the place, either Fran or Gil had to teach them. It would be a little difficult if Fran wasn’t free to help.\n\n\n “Rosina has been a great help with the paperwork so I have some time to do so.”\n\n\n “Alright, please let Wilma now and we’ll go to the orphanage tomorrow.”\n\n\n After settling the time for tomorrow’s meeting, there was a sudden knock on the door. My attendants would usually enter the room without knocking and everyone else in the temple, including the High Priest and his attendants, would use a bell. Only Lutz and Tuuli, and others from the lower city, would knock on the door.\n\n\n “Lutz is already here? He’s early today.”\n\n\n The fifth bell had just rung. I walked to the stairs and looked down it towards the door on the first floor, Fran, on the other hand, went downstairs to greet them. Damuel opened the door with a wary look. Lutz was standing outside the door, along with Tuuli.\n\n\n “Welcome, please come it.” Fran greeted them and was about to close the door when I heard Gil’s tell from a distance, “Wait a moment!”\n\n\n Fran held the door for a while and I was greeted my the sight of Gil running into the room, panting hard.\n\n\n “Tuuli, why are you here?”\n\n\n “We’re here to take you back home, Myne.” Tuuli grinned at me who was running down the stairs.\n\n\n “Remember that things are dangerous right now? Well, I’m going to protect you, Myne!” she boasted while puffing her chest.\n\n\n Gil stood upright and puffed his chest too, and shouted out as though he was competing with her, “I’ll protet you, Sister Myne! It’s my job as your attendant!”\n\n\n “Thank you for the concern, both of you, but that would make it harder for my bodyguard to work.”\n\n\n I glanced at Damuel who looked a little annoyed at having to look after so many children.\n\n\n “…Yes, it would be much more dangerous if I had to protect more people.”\n\n\n “Huh? I apologise on their behalf, Sir Damuel. Tuuli wasn’t aware about it.”\n\n\n We couldn’t do much about it now that everyone was already here. It was a little early but I decided to head home with everyone. Rosina helped me out of my robes and into my casual clothes so that I could leave the temple.\n\n\n “Fran, please pass the message to the orphanage. I will make my leave now.”\n\n\n “As you wish. Please stay safe.”\n\n\n ~~~\n\n\n We left the temple with Lutz and Gil walking in the front, Damuel at the back, with me and Tuuli in the middle.\n\n\n “Thank you for this Tuuli, but I think it’s best for you to not walk me home,” I said.\n\n\n “Why?”\n\n\n “If something bad were to happen, Sir Damuel will have to jump in to protect me. Things might get more risky if he has to protect us both.”\n\n\n Damuel might be a fully-trained knight but that didn’t make him omnipotent. In fact, he was stuck here because he needed to guard me. When things get dangerous, his priority would be my safety, and he might not be able to protect Tuuli if the situation worsens. He might even resort to abandoning her to flee with me, and I didn’t want to think of the possibility of Tuuli being taken as a hostage to threaten us.\n\n\n “Frankly, you’re more likely to get injured than me.”\n\n\n “…I understand.” Tuuli pouted and frowned.\n\n\n I could tell she wanted to tell me that she was more than capable to protect me and herself, but her sulking wasn’t going to make me give in to her. Tuuli was more important than my well-being, I couldn’t bare to see her get injured.\n\n\n We walked through the central plaza and walked south towards the Artisan’s Street and made a last turn, after which it would be a straight walk home. We took a side path that was less crowded compared to the main road, and then we ran into Otto. He was holding onto a spear and was watching the area, he seemed to be on a patrol.\n\n\n “Good afternoon, Otto. We haven’t seen each other for some time.”\n\n\n “Myne!”\n\n\n Otto smiled when he saw me.\n\n\n “It’s good to see that you’re safe. You have no idea how worried I was thinking about the captain beating me up if you weren’t fine.”\n\n\n It felt quite worrying to see him this unnerved. It made me wonder if he had ever done something before that tempted Dad to beat him.\n\n\n “…Otto, did you do something?”\n\n\n “Hey, it’s not my fault. Blame the commander of the guards at the east gate and the other guards,” Otto responded with a shrug.\n\n\n He explained that he had been occupied with all the paperwork in the office when the guards on duty along with the commander had done something that made Dad want to beat them up, so much so that he was now here because of their mistakes.\n\n\n “In the afternoon, captain told the other commanders at the other gates to gather at the central plaza to pass an important message.:\n\n\n “Huh?” I was surprised to hear that.\n\n\n Dad probably wanted to tell them that the archduke was out of the duchy and that there were not to be any other entries for nobles. That felt like a bad premonition.\n\n\n Otto continued to explain how Dad had arrived to work much earlier than his afternoon shift. He had gone to the commander to tell him about what was going on and that they needed to call a meeting with the other commanders at the plaza. He conveyed to them what Damuel had told him, to watch out for any forged passes because the archduke was absent, after which he returned back to the east gate.\n\n\n “It was just that the east gate had already let a noble through before the captain returned. The commander had yet to instruct the guards so they were completely unaware of the fact that the pass might be a forged one. It was only when it was time for captain’s shift that did he discover this. He yelled at the commander about it before running out to the temple to check on you. Did you not run into him?”\n\n\n I shot my head up to look at Damuel, I could only think about how a noble had gotten pass the gates and not that I didn’t see that. Damuel looked shocked too.\n\n\n “They went through?! It can’t be but was it the noble who tried to enter a few days ago?”\n\n\n “That’s right. I’m surprised that you know this much, yes, it was the same noble. All the guards at the east gate have been dispatched to search for them, but we haven’t found a trace yet. Could they be in the Noble’s District? If that’s so, I suppose they would have run into the knights at the north gate,” Otto said.\n\n\n It seemed that despite the archduke having forbidden the entry of nobles from outside the city into the duchy, not all soldiers shared the same sense of danger and urgency. It seemed apparent that the soldiers remained ignorant of any possible dangers even through the archduke had warned that no noble from the outside where to enter the duhcy.\n\n\n “Have you reported this to the Knight’s Order?!” Damuel was fuming and extremely agitated, but Otto remained unbothered and said. “…Probably, I guess? The commander might have done it, but then again the captain ran out before he could tell them.:\n\n\n “You should have reported this right away, you idiot!” Damuel whipped out his wand just as he scolded Otto for his carelessness. He didn’t respond to Otto who was surprised by his wand and muttered out a “What? Wait a second, you’re a noble?”, instead he sent out a red beacon into the sky that was used to call for help.\n\n\n The knights will be here soon, I sighed in relied at the sight of the red light in the sky just when Tuuli was pulled away from me.\n\n\n “Huh? Tu—” I didn’t finish my words when something rough and opaque went over my head, after which I began floating in the air.\n\n\n “Ah!!!”"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n “Ferdinand, we’ve got an estimate of the costs. This document is for the furniture that will be going into the room at the castle and this one lists all the costs of the preparations required for the baptism ceremony.”\n\n\n Karstedt’s voice reverberated through my room. Recently, he’s been visiting me every single day so I’ve gotten used to his characteristically loud voice. I stopped labouring away on my temple-related office work and glanced at the wooden board he had placed in front of me. The contents written on it were the budget estimations for Myne to become the archnoble lady, Rozemyne. She’s going to be baptised as the daughter of archnobles before being adopted by the archduke. However, unlike a normal archnoble child, the preparations go far beyond her room in the noble’s district. Her room and clothes need to be prepared before she can move into the castle and the same needs to be done in her High Bishop’s quarters. I was the one who originally proposed that Myne should be adopted by a noble. Hence, I can’t allow Karstedt to bear all the monetary costs by himself. As Myne’s guardian, I will be paying the costs for her room at the temple as well as any costs related to the baptism ceremony.\n\n\n “…Karstedt, what in the gods’ names is this? Why would you need two outfits for her baptism ceremony? That’s completely unnecessary.”\n\n\n “I’m just choosing to buy peace at home with a little bit of money. Wouldn’t you say it’s a necessary expense?”\n\n\n “Perhaps it’s a necessary expense for you but it’s unnecessary for Rozemyne.”\n\n\n “Fine. I’ll pay for the second outfit myself.”\n\n\n Rozemyne is currently away from the temple. I passed her over to Elvira so she could be educated in the ways of an archnoble lady while living in Karstedt’s mansion. She needs to have memorised all the knowledge and behaviour appropriate for a young archnoble lady by the time her baptism ceremony comes around. I’m obviously unable to teach her those things myself. It appears that she’s been getting along well with her new family. According to Karstedt, his first wife Elvira and third son Cornelius have taken a liking to her.\n\n\n …It would be a lot easier if I could just leave her be, but…\n\n\n Whenever Rozemyne becomes emotionally unstable, it’s easy for her magic to run out of control. She has so much mana that an incident like that could potentially be very dangerous. That has only been further exacerbated now that she has been separated from her commoner family. I visit and check up on her every few days and also receive regular reports from Elvira, however, there have been no signs of her emotional turmoil and her education has also been proceeding smoothly.\n\n\n …Personally, I’d like nothing more than to be able to lower the frequency of my visits, but I wonder if that’s going to be feasible?\n\n\n There’s a mountain load of work that I have to do while Rozemyne is away from the temple. In addition to my usual temple-related work, I also have to conduct interrogations of Count Bindewald and the former High Bishop, erase any and all traces of Myne when she was a commoner and do all of those things while preparing for Rozemyne’s baptism ceremony and subsequent adoption by the archduke.\n\n\n But with all that said, it’s still not a good idea to ignore Rozemyne while focusing on my work. I have no idea what she’ll end up doing if I don’t keep an eye on her. As soon as I turn around, it feels like she always catches a fever, faints and collapses or gets herself involved in some kind of troublesome situation. I’d be troubled if she causes even more problems that she does now. She’s the sort of person who must be kept under surveillance at all costs. As I was considering various things in my mind while carefully reading Karstedt’s wooden board, Fran entered the room.\n\n\n “High Priest, Lord Karstedt. There’s something which I wish to consult with the two of you about. May I have a little bit of your time?”\n\n\n It seems like some kind of problem came up while they were preparing the High Bishop’s quarters. I turned towards Fran and nodded to indicate that he should continue.\n\n\n “I know I was instructed to select Lady Rozemyne’s tableware with the utmost care, but…”\n\n\n As I listened to Fran’s words, I couldn’t hide the frown that naturally showed on my face. I recalled a time when Myne had asked to eat lunch with me so that she could use it as a reference for a stereotypical noble’s meal. Hence, I had invited her over to eat during one of her regular harspiel examinations. The tableware used at the time should have been no different from those regularly used by nobles. I hadn’t given it much thought at the time, but I believe there shouldn’t be any problems with using that as a point of reference.\n\n\n “Rozemyne can continue using her personal coat of arms which was embroidered on her apprentice blue shrine maiden ceremonial costume. I don’t think there’s anything worth worrying about.”\n\n\n “No, the problem here is that Lady Rozemyne hasn’t changed her tableware at all since joining the temple.”\n\n\n “But when I had a look, it didn’t seem like it was tableware brought from her commoner household. I remember receiving a report stating that the Gilberta Company had prepared various things for her kitchen and bathroom. Did they not also change all the tableware back then?”\n\n\n Fran withered under my stern gaze as if he found the topic difficult to talk about.\n\n\n “Until now, Lady Rozemyne has been using the tableware which Sister Margaret left behind in the orphanage director’s quarters. They’ve got Sister Margaret’s coat of arms on them, albeit in an inconspicuous location.”\n\n\n Looks like her bed wasn’t the only thing that Myne was reusing. Her tableware was also a hand-me-down.\n\n\n “Considering she’s supposed to be Karstedt’s daughter who was hidden away in the temple, it certainly will be a problem if others find out that she’s been using tableware with someone else’s coat of arms.”\n\n\n I had heard she’d been using the furniture which was already in the room, but I didn’t think she’d been using the old tableware as well. If she’s willing to pay one large gold to enter the temple’s library, I wish she’d also be as willing to spend that money on the necessary expenses to protect herself. This is giving me a headache.\n\n\n “From now on, Darmuel is no longer going to be her only guard coming in and out of the temple. You have to make sure to carefully select all the tableware she uses so that others don’t notice anything strange.”\n\n\n Darmuel knows that Myne was a commoner, however, from now on there will also be various female knights who accompany her. Although her retinue won’t be very big, it doesn’t change the fact that nobles will be entering her living quarters.\n\n\n Since the title of High Bishop has changed hands, there is also a high possibility of blue priests coming to visit her. If she has any guests, she’ll have no choice but to prepare tea for them so the matter of her tableware is something that needs to be taken care of as soon as possible. That will be one more addition to the list of things for Karstedt to worry about. Fran turned towards Karstedt with the worry apparent on his face.\n\n\n “I understand that this is a matter of utmost importance, but we don’t have the authority to order something made with the coat of arms of Ehrenfest. I’m sorry to say this, but may I please burden Lord Karstedt with this task?”\n\n\n Only the castle’s exclusive crastman is allowed to make tableware with the duchy’s coat of arms. It’s illegal for anybody else to imprint the duchy’s crest on their wares. Karstedt nodded in understanding while saying “So that’s why you needed my presence as well”.\n\n\n “In that case, I’ll just order the same kind of tableware that they use in the castle. I’ll get it done now.”\n\n\n “There’s no need to be in such a rush, Karstedt. Order something different for the tableware she’ll be using in the temple. I want to give others the impression that she’s been using it for a long time. It’s best to not leave any loose ends hanging.”\n\n\n As I emphasised the importance of matching the fabricated tale of Myne being hidden and raised in the temple, Karstedt scrunched his eyebrows in irritation.\n\n\n “Are you telling me to order new tableware with my household’s crest? If we do that, it won’t match the narrative that I was keeping her hidden. Wouldn’t it make more sense to use the crest of Rozemary’s family, Joisontak?”\n\n\n “Elvira will be named as the mother at the baptism ceremony so it’ll be important to clarify the familial relationships. Besides, although we made up the setting that Rozemyne is the third wife’s child, we already decided that we wouldn’t publicise it. There will be problems regardless of what crest we end up using, but matching her family is probably the safest bet.”\n\n\n With Elvira’s warnings and advice, we ended up slightly changing Rozemyne’s background story from the original script. A certain degree of ambiguity will be necessary. But even as I gave him my explanation, Karstedt was apparently not willing to budge on his stance of refusing to get new tableware with his family’s crest. As Karstedt sat there frowning, Fran decided to speak up to him.\n\n\n “Lord Karstedt, there are plenty of blue priests and shrine maidens in the temple who have placed their family crest in inconspicuous locations. Even if most of Lady Rozemyne’s belongings have her personal coat of arms, the narrative will be more believable if Lord Karstedt’s coat of arms were also present in some discrete spots.”\n\n\n “Is that so…?”\n\n\n Even with Fran’s added explanation, Karstedt still looked skeptical, likely because he was unfamiliar with customs in the temple. At that moment, I finally understood the problem with Karstedt’s thought process. Among nobles, it’s commonly believed that a child who is hidden and secretly raised will eventually become a servant of the household when they grow up.\n\n\n “The status of a child who was hidden and secretly raised in a mansion in the noble’s district is different to that of a child who was entrusted to the temple. Most of the blue priests and shrine maidens in the temple have clear connections to their families. They receive an allowance from the archduke and will often carry the tithes that they collected during the Harvest Festival to their family’s domain. It would be very inconvenient for them if they had to hide their relationship to their relatives.”\n\n\n Even though blue priests and shrine maidens are not raised in the noble district, that didn’t mean they had completely cut off all connections with their family of origin. There’s always a chance that they’d be allowed to return if an emergency occurred.\n\n\n “I see now. It seems I had some misunderstandings. Very well. In that case there shouldn’t be any problems even if I were to use my coat of arms for Rozemyne’s tableware.”\n\n\n It looks like we’ve finally been able to ease Karstedt’s worries.\n\n\n “That will do for the coat of arms, but what about the design itself? I think it will definitely be strange if all the tableware is exactly the same as the ones we have at home. After all, children usually use their mother’s chosen workshop.”\n\n\n Karstedt’s concerns weren’t unfounded. If the mother’s identity was supposed to be hidden, then they couldn’t use the same designs as the ones at Karstedt’s house which had been chosen by his first wife Elvira. If that were to happen, it’d be the equivalent of saying Elvira has been hiding her own child from herself.\n\n\n “Well then, what kind of design should we go with…?”\n\n\n “High Priest, since you are Lady Rozemyne’s guardian at the temple, why don’t we use a similar design to your tableware? I don’t think it would be unnatural to assume that you were heavily involved in her decisions…”\n\n\n I carefully considered Fran’s proposal. Certainly, this doesn’t sound like a bad idea. It seems like Karstedt arrived at the same conclusion. He gave an impressed nod to signify his approval.\n\n\n “Ferdinand, what kind of tableware do you use?”\n\n\n “The same stuff as before. I haven’t changed my tableware in a long time.”\n\n\n I instructed my attendant Rotal to bring us one of my tea sets. I had been using it from way back, even in the castle before I’d been forced into the temple. As soon as Karstedt saw the large prominent Ehrenfest crest engraved on it, his eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.\n\n\n “Did you really use this while you were in the temple…? I’m amazed that Lady Veronica didn’t throw a fit over it.”\n\n\n “Pfft, do you really think she gave permission? She gave instructions to the former High Bishop that people in the temple were not allowed to use anything symbolic of the archduchal clan. As a result, he complained to me about it all the time.”\n\n\n After chasing me out of the archduchal clan and taking away my inheritance rights, Veronica continued to complain, claiming that I shouldn’t use any tableware that hinted I was a part of the archduchal clan.\n\n\n “But as you know, I don’t actually have a mother.”\n\n\n During my baptism ceremony, that person refused to be named as my mother. As a result, she personally ruined any possibility for me to have a coat of arms other than the one for Ehrenfest. If she’d just swallowed her pride and reluctantly agreed, my coat of arms after entering the temple would have been her family, Gibe Groschel’s crest.\n\n\n “Besides, the mansion I received from my father upon reaching adulthood was the place where Lady Irumhilde originally resided. Obviously, all the crests in that mansion represented the archduchal clan. I don’t have any other crests I can use.”\n\n\n Lady Irumhilde was the daughter of the second wife of the archduke from two generations ago and hence was my father’s half-sister. She caught an illness during her childhood which left her unable to bear a child. Hence, instead of marrying into another duchy, she decided to work as an assistant to the archduchal clan and was granted a mansion in the noble’s district. If she hadn’t perished just before my baptism ceremony, she would have been named as my mother. But I only barely knew her for half a year so my memories of that time are rather vague. But I remember her being a kind woman with neat and tidy hair. She was very gentle and caring and I distinctly remember that on our very first meeting, she asked me “Do you perhaps feel any discomfort from being touched by me?” while stroking me with her slender white fingers.\n\n\n “Did Lady Veronica not think of instructing you to design a new coat of arms for personal use?”\n\n\n “Of course she did. But I entered the temple so I could cut my ties with that woman. Why would I need to follow her instructions afterwards?”\n\n\n She called the former High Bishop to the castle numerous times but Veronica never stepped foot in the temple herself. As a result, I made it my policy to ignore all her requests and let Sylvester take care of things on his end. Upon hearing my cynical explanation, Karstedt shrugged his shoulders while Fran smiled and decided to return to the topic of Rozemyne’s tableware.\n\n\n “A mere grey priest such as myself is unaware of the ins and outs of noble society, but if we imitate the High Priest’s tableware, wouldn’t it be rather fitting for a daughter of the archduke?”\n\n\n “Hmm… Put Rozemyne’s personal crest here and put Karstedt’s crest in some sort of inconspicuous location. Since I’ll be the one placing the order as her guardian, the design itself will resemble tableware used by members of the archduchal clan and it will be difficult to immediately spot the connection to Karstedt.”\n\n\n As he listened to my mutterings, Karstedt nodded and commented “We’ll go with that”.\n\n\n “Should we make Lady Rozemyne’s tableware a different colour to yours, High Priest?”\n\n\n Upon hearing Fran’s words, I stopped and contemplated for a few seconds.\n\n\n “Tableware for members of the archduchal clan are usually made in the colour of their birth season. If we follow that tradition, Rozemyne’s would be blue. However, since I’m not a child of the first wife, I wasn’t permitted to use the usual shade of green for mine and could only choose a dark green colour. Rozemyne is also a child who was raised in secret and isn’t the first wife’s child either. In which case, a lighter or darker shade… It might be a good idea to slightly change the colour.”\n\n\n “Hmm… Then how about dark blue? It would also match Rozemyne’s hair colour.”\n\n\n I simply nodded in response to Karstedt’s suggestion and said “That sounds good to me”.\n\n\n Fran also jotted it down in his notes.\n\n\n “High Priest, what is the meaning of the letters engraved inside this cup?”\n\n\n “They’re acronyms for my name. Everyone in the castle uses tableware with the same designs. This makes it easier for attendants to differentiate between them.”\n\n\n “Oh, so that’s what they’re there for? There are all sorts of fussy rules for the tableware in the castle and you can’t even make them to your own liking so I’d always let my attendants take care of those things.”\n\n\n Karstedt gave a deeply satisfied nod as though he had just solved some kind of mystery. This is only something I’ve heard about from others, but until Sylvester was born, Karstedt had been raised in the castle as an archduke candidate. Afterwards, he was probably stripped of the position by Veronica. I’ve heard people say things along those lines. Although, it does feel like Karstedt better suits the description of a knight commander rather than an archduke candidate. As such thoughts were running through my mind, I noticed that Fran was staring at a magic circle on my tea set which had lit up.\n\n\n “High Priest, I’ve noticed that many of the blue priests and shrine maidens have their clan’s coat of arms in the centre of their saucers or on the outside of their cups, but your tableware has magic circles on them. Is this something that’s necessary for Lady Rozemyne?”\n\n\n “No, she won’t need anything like that.”\n\n\n In a hidden spot on the bottom of my cup, I have placed a detoxifying magic circle. It activates if I touch it and supply mana to it. It’s currently activated since I’m holding it.\n\n\n “You actually made an effort to hide it?”\n\n\n “Of course. It’s amusing to watch the reactions of the person who poisoned it as they wonder why the poison isn’t working.”\n\n\n I couldn’t actually make an effective magic circle for this purpose until I was in my 3rd grade of studies at the Royal Academy. It was only in my senior years that I was finally able to hide my detoxifying magic circles without Veronica noticing. Personally, I wish I had this magic circle available to me before I got used to all the poison. Now that Veronica is no longer in power, it’s all gone to waste since there’s no longer any opportunities to use it.\n\n\n “Alright, I will order a new set of tableware with this design in mind. High Priest, Lord Karstedt, I gratefully thank thee for your generous advice.”\n\n\n “Fran, write it down on an order slip and pass it to me when you done. I’ll send it over to my exclusive craftsman.”\n\n\n Since I’m Rozemyne’s guardian, it’s more appropriate if I’m the one to make the order. Fran and Karstedt nodded without any complaints. With the topic of discussion finally over, Karstedt got up and walked from my work desk to the dining table.\n\n\n “That was a pretty tiring discussion.”\n\n\n It seems like he wants to take a break. I passed the tea set I was holding in my hands over to Fran.\n\n\n “Fran, it’s been a while, but may I burden you with the task of preparing tea?”\n\n\n “Understood. Would some reffel-scented Gruchtee suffice?”"

    "content": " \n\n\n\n Everything went according to plan. A huge fuss was raised when my brother and sister’s engagement was announced at the Spring Feast. Things only got worse when it was announced that my sister was heading to the temple despite being the root source of all the commotion. My brother had a hard time dealing with all the nobles who wanted to greet him, but on the contrary, there weren’t really any people who wanted to greet me since I was no longer a candidate to become the next archduke.\n\n\n Amidst all the chaos, I was invited to a tea party by my mother. Mother’s room in the main building was close to the children’s room where I had spent my childhood until my baptismal ceremony. Hence, I experienced a lot of nostalgic feelings as I walked down the hallway to my mother’s room. According to rumours I heard from my attendants, Melchior had become even more of a spoiled child in my absence after my baptismal ceremony. I wonder how he’s doing. During the winter, I was busy leading the winter playroom and hence did not have many opportunities to head to the main building. I’m sure he’s probably feeling lonely.\n\n\n “Vanessa, do I have time to meet Melchior after my mother’s tea party?”\n\n\n “This request is too sudden so it will be impossible to arrange for it today. I’ll make an appointment for your visit on a later date when your schedule is free.”\n\n\n I was admonished by my head attendant Vanessa. There are a lot of hassles that come with being a member of the archduchal family. I have to receive permission just to enter a children’s room that I used to live in. My thoughts always drift in that direction when I hear the tales of my retainers’ childhoods. I nostalgically gazed at the door to the children’s room as I passed by before entering my mother’s room.\n\n\n “Charlotte, welcome to my room. It’s been a while since the last time we had a one-to-one talk with one another… Let’s talk in the hidden room today.”\n\n\n The topic my mother wished to discuss with me today was probably going to be one that would stir my emotions. I tensed up and thanked my mother for her invitation before following her into the hidden room. I wonder when was the last time I entered my mother’s hidden room? As I sat down, the attendants made preparations for the tea party. Are the chefs trying their hand at making new sweets in preparation for the Archduke’s Conference? All sorts of sweets that I had never eaten before were lined up in front of me.\n\n\n “Lord Sylvester purchased some new recipes from Rozemyne in preparation for the Archduke’s Conference.”\n\n\n “…It never fails to amaze me how she’s able to think of all these things, one after another.”\n\n\n Usually, a noble’s personal chef would think up a new recipe and then their master or mistress would proliferate it under their name. However, I heard that my sister personally teaches her chefs the recipes that she wants them to make.\n\n\n “Mother, how has Melchior been holding up these days? I felt nostalgic when I passed by his room earlier so I was thinking of paying him a visit soon.”\n\n\n “I’m sure Melchior would be overjoyed if you or Wilfried showed up to visit him. Recently, his baptism ceremony has been the only thing on his mind. He’s been thinking with his attendants about what kind of furniture he’d like to set up in his room.\n\n\n “Oh my. But Melchior’s baptism ceremony will be next year. There’s no need for him to be in such a rush.”\n\n\n I thought back to my experience of my own baptism ceremony. Even if he was trying to hurry, they would have only just started choosing the craftsmen to make his furniture.\n\n\n “During Winter, you were busy with the Winter playroom and didn’t have time to visit him in the main building, right? He’s been feeling lonely ever since you left for the northern complex.”\n\n\n “I also want Melchior to come to the northern building as soon as possible.”\n\n\n After settling in with talk about Melchior’s recent activities, the preparations for tea were finished and mother asked all the attendants to leave the room. Only the two of us were left inside the hidden room. My mother smiled warmly at me before speaking.\n\n\n “Did you hear from Wilfried and Rozemyne about their activities at the Royal Academy?”\n\n\n “Yes. Rozemyne was gushing about the library and it was the only thing she talked about. Isn’t there a magic tool that looks like a giant schumil? They were discussing their plans to make clothes for it. My retainers were also keen to help out too.”\n\n\n My sister kept talking about things such as the number of books in the royal academy’s library, her profound respect for the librarian Ms Solange and just how useful Schwartz and Weiss were.\n\n\n …Even though her attendants kept trying to change the topic, it always ended up being redirected back towards the library. Eventually, her attendants also gave up and just let her talk as she pleased. Her golden eyes sparkled as she talked enthusiastically, making her look much more adorable than usual with a personality that befit her young appearance.\n\n\n “Did Wilfried say anything?”\n\n\n “He complained about the various troubles he faced from being dragged around by Rozemyne’s whims and boasted about being chosen as an honours student. Oh, add in the talk about Gewinnen and that just about sums it up… He seemed to be overjoyed about winning once in Gewinnen against Drewanchel’s Ortwin and kept telling that story over and over again.”\n\n\n “…Did your retainers who attended the Royal Academy with them have anything to say about that?”\n\n\n Mother looked at me with a piercing gaze as if she wanted to learn the truth. She probably wanted to find out the circumstances behind the reports that she received about their daily lives in the Royal Academy. If their attendants lied for their master’s sake, the parents would have a hard time learning the truth.\n\n\n “Wilfried’s words seemed to be a little bit exaggerated, but it looks like it was true that he was struggling to keep up with the various situations that he got caught up in. Just to name a few, there’s placating Rozemyne who wanted to force all the first graders to pass their courses on the very first day and being forced to accept countless invitations to tea parties which were full of women as well as receiving invitations to a treasure-stealing ditter rematch. He had his own fair share of troubles.”\n\n\n “I see.”\n\n\n Mother let out a deep sigh to show her relief. I guess that means there weren’t many disparities with the reports that she received. It seems like she was quite worried about Wilfried’s daily life at the Royal Academy.\n\n\n “But the one thing to note is that it seems Rozemyne’s influence has been felt far and wide across the entire Royal Academy. From winning a ditter competition against Dunkelferger to being the source of all sorts of new trends in the Royal Academy and surprising everyone from other duchies with the speed and excellence with which she completed her tasks at the academy to even building personal connections to royalty and archduke candidates from greater duchies. While she was absent from the academy, all sorts of rumours involving her were spread around and her name and presence could be felt everywhere.”\n\n\n “From the information told to me by Lord Sylvester, I could only see the reports of Wilfried being dragged around by Rozemyne’s whims so I didn’t really understand what Wilfried himself was doing.”\n\n\n As mother said those words, she picked up her cup and drank some tea before facing towards me again. Noticing her blue eyes fixed on me as if to examine my inner feelings, I realised that she was finally going to touch down on the main topic that she invited me here for. I straightened my posture a little before putting down my cup and looking straight back into her eyes.\n\n\n “Today I invited you here to apologise to you for the matter of Wilfried and Rozemyne’s engagement.”\n\n\n “Mother…”\n\n\n “Until now you’ve always been swayed by our whims and used for our own convenience whenever it benefitted Ehrenfest. And yet, we’ve closed off the path for you to become the next archduke. I’m really sorry.”\n\n\n In order to oppose Wilfried who was raised by our grandmother, I was given an education befitting that of an heir to inherit the position of archduke. There were numerous incidents such as my grandmother’s downfall, the White Tower incident and Rozemyne’s two-year coma which caused my education to stop and restart many times. But with this engagement announcement, I was forcefully removed as a candidate from the competition to inherit the position of archduke and all my efforts were rendered meaningless.\n\n\n Hearing my mother’s apology caused all the unpleasant feelings I had suppressed within the depths of my heart to rise back up to the surface.\n\n\n “Charlotte.”\n\n\n Mother came over to me and wrapped her arm around my shoulder. As soon as I felt that gentle warmth, drops of liquid fell down onto the back off my hand. My hands were quivering as I tightly gripped them into fists.\n\n\n “…Even though everyone said he was going to stand out at the Winter socialising event, he managed to be educated just in time. Even though there was the White Tower incident which dragged him down from the position of heir, he was once again reinstated with the announcement of this engagement. No matter what happened, Wilfried’s always managed to find a way to save himself. He really is loved by the gods.”\n\n\n I’ve been working hard my entire life. From the times when my brother was playing around and being spoiled by grandmother to the time when grandmother’s downfall happened to the time of the White Tower incident when Wilfried’s reputation was wounded to the two years when Rozemyne fell into a coma… But my efforts always went unrewarded.\n\n\n “It’s too unfair…”\n\n\n It’s considered inelegant and unsightly for a lady to pour out her emotions into words like this. However, mother didn’t scold me and simply continuously apologised to me while gently patting my head and stroking my back.\n\n\n I wiped away my tears and fixed my disorderly breathing. I held my mother’s hand which was patting my head and smiled at her while saying “I’m alright now”.\n\n\n “I still feel some frustration remaining in my chest but without an opportunity like this, I wouldn’t even have been able to voice those feelings aloud.”\n\n\n “Yes, that’s true. Your retainers were very worried because you weren’t saying anything. They urged me to have a heart-to-heart chat with you.”\n\n\n Right now, the nobles were making a huge fuss about the engagement announcement and on top of that, everyone was busy getting ready for the Archduke Conference. It seems like my retainers had worked hard to get my mother to specially make time to invite me to a private tea party.\n\n\n …Even though my mother and retainers are all having a hard time…\n\n\n Even though I’m no longer a candidate to become the archduke, my retainers were unwaveringly continuing to look out for me and serving me to the best of their abilities. I must also act as a suitable mistress to repay their loyalty.\n\n\n “I understand that this engagement is the best thing that could happen for Ehrenfest’s future. If Rozemyne was the one to become the heir, I would have considered myself utterly defeated and would have had no regrets. But…”\n\n\n Rozemyne became my sister at her baptism ceremony, but she has the achievements and mana capacity that make her worthy of the position. Nowadays, nobody would complain about father’s decision to adopt her. I can’t imagine myself competing against her. Rozemyne is my saviour and someone whom I greatly respect.\n\n\n “Of course, if you take into consideration her gender, health and blood lineage, it’s difficult for her to become the next archduke. I understand father’s perspective of wanting to protect your reputation as the first wife and I know that there’s no better combination.”\n\n\n Melchior is too young to marry my sister and I’m the same sex as her.\n\n\n “Since the person herself seems to be satisfied with the engagement, I won’t voice any complaints. Although I am a bit dissatisfied about Wilfried becoming the heir simply due to this engagement.”\n\n\n “Charlotte…”\n\n\n “And it’s even more unfair to Melchior since his path to becoming the heir was cut off before he even had his baptism ceremony.”\n\n\n With Wilfried and Rozemyne’s engagement, Melchior and I no longer had any pathways to become the next archduke. I was really frustrated that all my efforts boiled down to nothing thanks to the schemes and customs of nobility.\n\n\n “If someone never had the option of inheriting the position, they wouldn’t care about it as much. That’s why, instead of Melchior who hasn’t been raised to be the heir, I’m more worried for your sake.”\n\n\n From the moment she became conscious of her surroundings as a child, the heir to the duchy of Frenbeltag had already been decided so my mother was raised without having ever competed for the position.\n\n\n “I guess all is well if Melchior doesn’t feel frustrated by this situation. Even though I went on a bit of a rant earlier, I agree that this was the right decision.”\n\n\n I took a deep breath and let out a sigh. I felt much better now after having my mother spoil me as I put all my pent-up feelings into words. I felt relieved to learn that Melchior wouldn’t experience the same feelings of frustration stemming from indignance and powerlessness that I did.\n\n\n “…What you said earlier was completely on the mark. Now that Rozemyne is developing new industries and creating new trends, the only one out of my children who can marry her is Wilfried. Please do your best to support Wilfried as his sister who shares the same blood as him.”\n\n\n …Sibling the shares the same blood? It’s true that Wilfried is also my mother’s child but…\n\n\n For the first time, I realised that my feelings about Wilfried differed from the familial bonds that my mother shared with him. The only sibling who I considered a ‘real’ sibling was Melchior but it seems like our mother valued all three of us equally as her children.\n\n\n …Wilfried was raised since birth by our grandmother. Does mother really consider Wilfried her own child even though she didn’t help raise him at all?\n\n\n All of it felt terribly strange to me. I never lived together with Wilfried until my baptism ceremony. To me, he was a close relative just like my adopted sister Rozemyne, but it never felt like he was my true family.\n\n\n Besides, I’m not sure whether it’s due to my dislike for our grandmother or due to my upbringing where I was repeatedly told to win against Wilfried and overthrow him to become the heir, but even now, Wilfried felt like an opponent I must win against rather than a blood-related sibling who I should cooperate with.\n\n\n …But if I voiced those thoughts out loud, I might end up hurting my mother’s feelings since she considered all three of us her own children.\n\n\n With the grandmother who discriminated between her own grandchildren out of the picture and the new entry of an adopted sister, Wilfried and I now had an amicable relationship as siblings. There was no need for me to go out of my way to mention that there was a barrier between us that made it difficult to think of him as my real sibling.\n\n\n “Leave it to me. After all, there are times when my brother can be a little bit reckless…”\n\n\n It seems mother understood that I had calmed down. She returned to her seat and brewed some tea with the utensils left behind by her attendants. I drank a sip of it. What a nostalgic flavour… This is my mother’s favourite tea and I grew up drinking this all the time.\n\n\n …It’s nostalgic but nowadays my preferences are a little different.\n\n\n I’m not sure if it’s because I started choosing tea flavours that went well with the sweets that my sister invented or if my tastebuds naturally changed as I grew up. Slowly but surely, my preferences in tea were diverging from my mother’s tastes.\n\n\n “I was educated with the idea that the most competent child should be the one who becomes archduke. That’s why, even now, I still think Rozemyne is the one most suitable for inheriting the position of archduke.”\n\n\n Rozemyne could already clearly envision the future she wanted for Ehrenfest. Unlike someone such as I who could only give a plain boring answer like “I want to continue to develop Ehrenfest”, my sister had revolutionary changes in mind that she wanted to implement in the duchy.\n\n\n “If Rozemyne develops new industries and Wilfried supports her with his power as archduke, I’m sure Ehrenfest will be developed into a much more prosperous duchy.”\n\n\n Upon hearing my words, my mother blinked her blue eyes in surprise.\n\n\n “…Charlotte, you said the exact same thing as Lord Ferdinand.”\n\n\n “My uncle said the same thing?”\n\n\n “Yes. He said that Rozemyne wouldn’t be the one supporting Wilfried, but instead, Wilfried would be the one steering Rozemyne and holding on to her reins.”\n\n\n Apparently, Rozemyne then indignantly retorted “Am I a rampaging horse!?”. Hearing my mother’s story, I couldn’t hold back my laughter.\n\n\n “Did Rozemyne really say something like that to uncle?”\n\n\n “It’s true. That child doesn’t know the meaning of fear. Even though it always sounds like they’re arguing, apparently that’s just how interactions between the two of them usually go. Even just as a spectator watching from the side, I was afraid of what was going to happen to her.”\n\n\n It seems like my mother was troubled as to whether she should intervene and mediate between the two of them.\n\n\n “Charlotte.”\n\n\n As my mother stopped laughing and returned to a serious expression, I also fixed my posture and sat up straight.\n\n\n “From now on, Rozemyne’s creations will be spreading throughout Yurgenschmidt. I’m not just talking about the sweets and cuisine she developed, but also her new industries such as paper-making and printing. Ehrenfest is going to have much more influence than before and many more duchies will seek a connection to Ehrenfest.”\n\n\n I gulped and nodded. I heard that my sister had received many marriage proposals. With her engagement, she was now definitely going to be staying in Ehrenfest. In which case, I’ll be the next one they’ll turn to. If they seek a connection to Ehrenfest, they’ll want me as a first wife who can attend Archduke Conferences.\n\n\n “Start thinking about which duchy you want to marry into and try strengthening your bonds with Wilfried and Rozemyne as much as possible. A strong relationship with Ehrenfest will serve to protect you as your shield in the future.”\n\n\n “May I enquire as to why?”\n\n\n I understood that in my mother’s mind, she had already changed my education plan from that of an heir to the position of archduke into that of a daughter marrying into another duchy as the first wife.\n\n\n “The way you get treated after marrying into another duchy will greatly depend on the benefits and cooperation you are able to bring to your new duchy from your homeland. Just being loved by your husband isn’t enough. The most important aspect for a woman marrying into another duchy is to have a good relationship with the heir to their original duchy.”\n\n\n …Does mother seriously think that even after father loved her so much that he never even married a second wife?\n\n\n Since my mother’s homeland Frenbeltag was caught up in the political purge, it was a realistic possibility that people’s attitude towards her could have also changed in various ways. I could feel the weight behind her words. Having also remembered my grandmother’s cold treatment and her frigid gaze, I let out a sigh of resignation.\n\n\n “In that case, I’ll try to deepen my bonds with Rozemyne as much as possible.”\n\n\n “Oh my, you’re choosing Rozemyne instead of Wilfried?”\n\n\n Mother opened her eyes wide in astonishment. Usually nobles would treasure the bonds they share with their blood-related siblings over anything else. I’m sure mother and father wouldn’t understand my decision, especially considering their own bonds that they forged with their blood-related siblings in Frenbeltag.\n\n\n “My sister is more reliable than my brother. After all, even though we had only barely met each other a few times, Rozemyne flew off into the night sky in order to save me.”\n\n\n Even though nobles often scorn her for her upbringing in the temple, I really adore my sister’s decisiveness during emergencies and her pure love and affection which would be unthinkable for a normal noble. I have faith that if I were to ever be in danger again, my sister would once again do everything in her power to save me.\n\n\n “I want to do everything I can to help Rozemyne so I can repay her for saving my life. If I were born as a man, I’m sure I would’ve fought my brother with all my power for the right to marry her. If she needed someone to support her, I’m sure I could do a much better job than my brother ever could.”\n\n\n “Oh my… If brothers were to fight each other over Rozemyne, I’m sure Elvira would have used it as inspiration for her books.”\n\n\n My mother giggled softly whilst looking like she was enjoying herself. I would be troubled if I were to become one of the characters in Elvira’s books, but everything I said was true.\n\n\n “I really want to start giving back to Rozemyne as soon as possible. That’s why I’ve been trying to cover for her weaknesses and the things that she doesn’t like doing.”\n\n\n “In that case, make sure you study hard. I’m sure you already know that the nobles have been opposed to your involvement in the printing industry before you enrol at the Royal Academy. But did you know that Rozemyne was the one who pushed for permission to allow you to get involved?”\n\n\n Apparently, the nobles in our duchy were afraid of there being a leakage of industry secrets if I were to marry into another duchy and hence, they tried to prevent me from getting involved in the printing industry. At the time, I was extremely frustrated but it seems like I had once again been helped by my sister.\n\n\n “…I didn’t know that.”\n\n\n “I only heard about it just the other day from Lord Sylvester. I was lamenting over how unfair it was that you didn’t receive any love from the gods but it seems like you’ve received plenty of love from Rozemyne.”\n\n\n In that moment, my mother’s words felt very reassuring. As I looked back up at her and replied “Yes” with a nod of my head, my mother laughed and stood up before opening the door of the hidden room. I could see the worried expressions on the faces of all my retainers who were gathered around the door. I’m sure I’ve worried them to no end in the past few days. I have taken a new step forward to become the first wife of another duchy instead of Ehrenfest’s next archduke."

    "content": " \n\n\n\n I’m Hannelore, an archduke candidate from Dunkelferger and freshman student at the Royal Academy.\n\n\n …Everything went wrong because of me.\n\n\n If we only look at mana capacity alone, then I have a befitting amount for an archduke candidate of Dunkelferger. But my timing is always terrible for everything and my family always scolds my actions and patterns of thought as being unbefitting of an archduke candidate. Since I’m always being scolded, I have no confidence in myself and I don’t think I can be like my brother.\n\n\n … I’m always trying to avoid inconveniencing others as little as possible, so I have no idea how things turned out like this.\n\n\n There were rumours flowing in the Royal Academy about large shumil-shaped magic tools helping Professor Solange in the library as well as rumours about the master of those magic tools being an archduke candidate from Ehrenfest. According to our dormitory supervisor Professor Rauffen, shumil-shaped magic tools belonged to the royal family but lost their previous master to the recent political purge and became inactive.\n\n\n I like shumils, so after hearing the rumours I decided to go pay them a visit. I was a little relieved to see I wasn’t alone and there were many like-minded female students who also came to visit the large shumil-shaped magic tools.\n\n\n Upon watching the very cute figures of the large black and white schumils helping out Professor Solange, I was extremely satisfied as I returned to the dorms.\n\n\n Along the way, I turned to my attendant Cordura and muttered “So cute. I’d love to also be the master of shumils like these.” I really only intended it as a light topic of conversation. Usually, there would be no problem at all and Cordura would simply follow up my words with a “That sounds lovely, milady”.\n\n\n But this time, my timing was bad since one of my brother’s retainers happened to overhear my words. Apparently that retainer then reported to my brother “Lady Hannelore wishes to become the master of the shumils”.\n\n\n “In order to let milady become the master of the large shumils, Lord Lestilaut will raise an objection towards Ehrenfest. Apparently the idea is to improve milady Hannelore’s status by letting you become the master of the royal family’s magic tools.”\n\n\n One day, as I was returning from the lecture halls, Cordura came to me with a troubled expression and told me about my brother’s mischief. Hearing her report, my eyes opened wide in surprise.\n\n\n During the court etiquette lecture, I was told that I lacked confidence and composed myself with a gait unbefitting of the dignity expected from an archduke candidate of a great duchy. It’s impossible for someone like me to even think about taking away the title of master of the shumils from Ehrenfest. On the contrary, that kind of behaviour is more likely to result in people thinking that I’m disqualified as an archduke candidate for Dunkelferger.\n\n\n …Brother, why are you trying to pick a fight with Ehrenfest!\n\n\n “I have to stop Lestilaut right away!”\n\n\n “…Just now, Professor Rauffen received an ordonnanz from Prince Anastasius summoning him to the scene. The situation is already out of the scope that milady can do anything about.”\n\n\n Having been stopped by Cordura, I held my head in my hands. Lestilaut had already lead Dunkelferger’s apprentice knights out of the dorms. If I passed my lecture the first time around instead of today, I’m sure I would have been able to talk him down and stop him.\n\n\n “Milady Hannelore, as always it seems your timing was off again.”\n\n\n “Cordura, that doesn’t comfort me at all.”\n\n\n As I was wondering about what to do, Prince Anastasius had already summoned the dorm supervisor. Even if I showed up now, I wouldn’t be able to change anything.\n\n\n As a result, I nervously waited for everyone to return. When they finally returned, it was already almost dinnertime. Being told that the specific details will be relayed over dinner, I ended up anxiously waiting before heading off to dinner with my heart in my mouth.\n\n\n Ehrenfest rejected Dunkelferger’s demands to hand over the position of master of the magic tools and just when it was about to become a brawl, Prince Anastasius arrived and intervened. The dorm supervisor was called over and in accordance to Professor Rauffen’s proposal, a ditter competition was held to determine who would be the master of the shumils. It seems like there are times when Professor Rauffen’s love for ditters could occasionally prove useful.\n\n\n Afterwards, Ehrenfest defeated the perennial ditter powerhouse Dunkelferger, and the position of master of the shumils remained unchanged. I was truly relieved that we did not end up stealing away Ehrenfest’s rights.\n\n\n “It’s infuriating that such a cowardly person would dare call herself a saint.”\n\n\n Due to being defeated by Lady Rozemyne’s strategy, Lestilaut was enraged, but Professor Rauffen and the apprentice knights were excitedly talking about the match.\n\n\n “If I may speak Lord Lestilaut, Lady Rozemyne is not a coward. Treasure-stealing ditter is all about using all means available to attain victory. The trick used this time was plenty exploitable and adorable in comparison to Lord Ferdinand’s schemes in the past.”\n\n\n Rauffen spoke happily about the ditter match and started recounting tales of a great tactician named Ferdinand who had defeated Dunkelferger numerous times in the past. He then started making plans for a revised training schedule for the apprentice knights.\n\n\n The apprentice knights started recounting tales that they heard from their own upperclassmen or older relatives about Lord Ferdinand’s numerous schemes and started to exchange information with one another. With greater zeal than usual, they pledged to win next time regardless of what tactic or scheme was thrown at them.\n\n\n “We’ll maintain this attitude in training and apply for a rematch with Ehrenfest.”\n\n\n “…Umm, Professor Rauffen? Please refrain from taking actions that will cause Ehrenfest any further trouble.”\n\n\n “Lady Hannelore, this isn’t trouble. It’s a ditter match.”\n\n\n Ditter matches might be Professor Rauffen’s favourite hobby but I don’t think there are very many female archduke candidates who would be happy to receive ditter rematch applications.\n\n\n …That said, unlike me, Lady Rozemyne really is such a model archduke candidate.\n\n\n She passed all her courses on the very first day, won a ditter match against Dunkelferger and was acknowledged by the prince as the master of the royal family’s magic tools. This year, she’s without a doubt the most attention-grabbing archduke candidate.\n\n\n I heard rumours about her being poisoned and sleeping in jureve for about two years. Due to insufficient growth, there was even talk about her potentially being unable to attend the Royal Academy. But right now, there was no sign of anything like that ever having happened. In fact, she stood out even more since she looked like she had only just finished her baptism ceremony.\n\n\n Despite looking young, Lady Rozemyne had a very beautiful tidy appearance with moon-like golden eyes and shockingly glossy indigo blue hair that was the colour of the evening sky and was always adorned with hair ornaments which no one had ever seen before.\n\n\n Dunkelferger also had many female students who desperately wanted information and I was currently being put under a lot of pressure to finish my lectures and start socialising with other duchies.\n\n\n …I need to meet Lady Rozemyne and invite her to a tea party but before that I need to first apologise for my brother’s rude behaviour. The incident this time must surely have given her a bad impression of us, so I need to think of a way to invite her with the utmost consideration.\n\n\n It’s considered unsightly to repeatedly bring up things from the past but my careless actions ended up causing Ehrenfest a great amount of trouble. I won’t be able to get these feelings off my chest unless I apologise at least once.\n\n\n …But how should I go about greeting Lady Rozemyne?\n\n\n Since we’re both freshmen, normally we’d be able to meet during lecture hours. But Lady Rozemyne quickly finished all her lectures so I don’t have any opportunities to meet her there.\n\n\n …Lord Wilfried also only shows up in the practical lessons for Schtappe usage. Even though they’re ranked 13th, Ehrenfest’s archduke candidates are truly exemplary.\n\n\n Luckily, tomorrow we also have a lecture on Schtappe usage so I should be able to meet Lord Wilfried. I would like to ask him whether he can create an opportunity for me to meet Lady Rozemyne.\n\n\n In the lecture on Schtappe usage, the current popular trend is to emblazon a coat of arms onto the Schtappe. It was something which Lord Wilfried started and everyone else had begun to copy him.\n\n\n If you inscribe a coat of arms onto your Schtappe, it will be different to everyone else’s and since it’s your own family’s coat of arms, it makes it easy to identify. Many students who wanted a unique Schtappe had started to follow this trend.\n\n\n “Wouldn’t Lady Hannelore’s coat of arms be an eagle since you’re from Dunkelferger? Are you not going to inscribe a coat of arms?”\n\n\n “The coat of arms style Schtappe that Lord Wilfried thought up is wonderful, however, since I’m eventually going to marry into another duchy, I have no intention of inscribing a coat of arms onto my Schtappe.”\n\n\n That was just a façade. I’m not used to controlling the flow of mana so I’m having difficulty even forming a simple Schtappe shape, let alone one with an intricate design. It’s impossible for me to inscribe something like a coat of arms.\n\n\n “I see. That kind of problem also exists. Even if it’s just the coat of arms, I want to make my Schtappe unique so I’m going to spend a bit more time tinkering with the design.”\n\n\n Wilfried brought out his Schtappe and began squinting at it with his dark green eyes. I only want to hurry up and finish my lectures as soon as possible and yet Wilfried is unsatisfied with the design of his Schtappe. I think his ambitious attitude is truly wonderful.\n\n\n “Umm, Lord Wilfried. How is Lady Rozemyne feeling? Will she consider it a bother if I invite her for a tea party? My brother was terribly rude to her the other day so I wish to invite her to a tea party and formally express my apologies.”\n\n\n Lord Wilfried thought for a little while before answering my question.\n\n\n “Ever since finishing her courses, Rozemyne has been spending every day in the library. During this time she has also been having tea parties with Klassenberg and various teachers, so it shouldn’t be a bother for her. She will be honoured to receive an invitation to a tea party hosted by Dunkelferger.”\n\n\n But just as I let out a sigh of relief, Lord Wilfried’s expression hardened slightly.\n\n\n “However, Rozemyne is scheduled to return to Ehrenfest in time for the Dedication Ritual so you probably don’t have a lot of time.”\n\n\n With the intention of socialising with Lady Rozemyne before she returns for the Dedication Ritual, I headed to the library when I finally had some free time. The reason why it took several days since hearing Lord Wilfried’s explanation was because unlike Lady Rozemyne, I was still not finished with my lectures and didn’t have a lot of free time.\n\n\n I walked around the library in circles and sighed. In the end, I was unable to find Lady Rozemyne.\n\n\n “It seems that today she’s having a tea party with Klassenberg’s Lady Eglantine. I remember receiving a report like that from an apprentice scholar.”\n\n\n “I see. I wonder when’s the next time I’ll be able to come to the library?”\n\n\n “That will be in 3 days’ time. Lady Hannelore, you’ll have more free time if you finish your courses with haste.”\n\n\n Unlike theory lectures, I’m not very good at practical lessons. I’m still struggling to properly form the shape of a shumil for my highbeast.\n\n\n Three days later, I finally had some free time and headed for the library again. However, on the way there, I encountered Lady Rozemyne following behind Prince Anastasius who was bringing her away. I once again slumped my shoulders in disappointment.\n\n\n …Ah, I failed to apologise again. Goddess of time, Dregarnuhr, please grant me your blessings.\n\n\n Seeing the pale expression on Lady Rozemyne’s face while she was being dragged away by Prince Anastasius made me realise it was an involuntary summons. I started to feel sick just by imagining myself being in her position of receiving summons from royalty.\n\n\n The next day, I once again headed for the library but I couldn’t spot Lady Rozemyne. After asking my apprentice scholars to gather information, apparently Lady Rozemyne was bedridden due to illness.\n\n\n “Lady Hannelore, how about we give up on meeting her directly and instead send an invitation to a tea party? The two of you are too incompatible in terms of timing.”\n\n\n Even though I’ve attended the same lectures before, unlike other archduke candidates who I gradually got closer to through conversation, I’ve never even spoken to Lady Rozemyne a single time. On top of that, I even caused her a significant amount of trouble so I haven’t had any opportunities to casually talk to her.\n\n\n At the very least, I would have liked to formally greet her before inviting her to a tea party but it seems like things won’t go according to my wishes. At this rate, Lady Rozemyne will return to Ehrenfest before I even find the opportunity to apologise to her.\n\n\n “Cordura, please send a tea party invitation to Ehrenfest. I don’t have any personal relationship with Lady Rozemyne so please set the invitee as Ehrenfest’s archduke candidate.”\n\n\n “As you wish.”\n\n\n I entrusted the tea party preparations to Cordura and studied while praying for Lady Rozemyne’s quick recovery. After all, I wanted to increase my free time as much as possible.\n\n\n “Lady Hannelore, I received a report stating that Lady Rozemyne went to the library.”\n\n\n “Let’s quickly make our way there as well.”\n\n\n I put away my textbooks and hastily made my way towards the library. Since archduke candidates need to be accompanied by attendants, apprentice scholars and apprentice knights, they usually don’t go to the library themselves.\n\n\n …I wonder why Lady Rozemyne reads books in the library.\n\n\n If an archduke candidate goes to a library, laynobles using the desks and accompanying retainers will all be troubled. Retainers also have their own lectures to attend so I think it’s difficult for them to accompany Lady Rozemyne on her daily trips to the library.\n\n\n Could it be possible that all of Lady Rozemyne’s retainers have finished their courses just like she has? Otherwise, there’s also the possibility that to qualify as the master of the large shumils one would need to spend a lot of time in the library.\n\n\n Now that I think about it, up until now, the master of the shumils had always been archnoble librarians from the Sovereignty so it might have been necessary to spend a lot of time in the library.\n\n\n …That means it would have been impossible for me to become their master.\n\n\n While thinking about such trivial things, I finally arrived at the library but couldn’t find Lady Rozemyne’s presence anywhere. Professor Solange approached me when she saw me wandering around aimlessly.\n\n\n “Dunkelferger’s Lady Hannelore, is there something you are looking for?”\n\n\n “I heard that Ehrenfest’s Lady Rozemyne had come here.”\n\n\n “If you’re searching for Lady Rozemyne, she has already returned to Ehrenfest. Due to her health suddenly deteriorating, she returned earlier than scheduled.”\n\n\n “…I see… Thank you ever so much for letting me know.”\n\n\n …Why did this have to happen now!? I can’t believe Lady Rozemyne is going to return before I even have an opportunity to apologise to her. I might actually be cursed by Dregarnuhr.\n\n\n I returned to the dorms like that while suppressing my feelings of melancholy.\n\n\n Upon returning to my room, I gloomily curled up into a ball, prompting Cordura to comfort me by saying “It’s not your fault, milady” while shaking her head.\n\n\n “Milady, there was nothing you could do. The timing was just unfortunate.”\n\n\n “Cordura, that doesn’t comfort me at all.”\n\n\n …Honestly, is there really nothing I can do about my bad timing?\n\n\n After that, there were numerous events which made me even more depressed.\n\n\n Firstly, the tea party invitation I had intended for Lady Rozemyne ended up being received by Lord Wilfried. It was impossible for Ehrenfest to reject an invitation from Dunkelferger.\n\n\n It would have been great if I could cancel the tea party from my end, but I was burdened with expectations from female students who were interested in Ehrenfest’s fashion trends and I was unable to betray those expectations.\n\n\n …Lord Wilfried, I’m really sorry!\n\n\n Afterwards, when I learnt that Lord Wilfried also had an obligation to attend other people’s tea parties because of the precedent I set, I felt even more depressed.\n\n\n Despite feeling uncomfortable as the only man in a tea party full of women, Lord Wilfried continued to smile and give replies which were devoid of substance. Seeing him like that, I once again wanted to apologise to him from the bottom of my heart.\n\n\n …I never thought things would end up like this, Lord Wilfried!\n\n\n When I heard that Professor Rauffen had applied for a ditter rematch with Ehrenfest without knowing about Lady Rozemyne’s absence, I could almost feel my soul leaving my body.\n\n\n …Once again, I’m truly sorry for everything, Lord Wilfried!\n\n\n Even just a little bit is fine.\n\n\n All I want is a little bit, so Goddess of time, Dregarnuhr, please grant me your blessings."
